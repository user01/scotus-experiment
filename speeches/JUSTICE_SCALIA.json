  "Why didn't these lawyers instead of -- instead of trying to sue on their own, why didn't they just offer their services to -- to these defendants through the State courts?",
  "I mean, that's what I don't understand about -- about the fact that they won't -­ won't have the right to counsel. It -- it's at least as easy for -- for counsel to appear in cases in which indigents need counsel as it is for counsel to bring their own lawsuit.",
  "There -- there's an appeal from -- they could request certiorari from the State supreme court to this Court, I assume.",
  "Do they have lawyers in those cases?",
  "Of course, also bearing upon our prudential judgment, I -- I suppose, would be that in order to reach the merits, we have to do what you assert to be an end run around the Younger abstention. And -­",
  "And presumably up to this Court, if they want to come that far.",
  "Of course, what the other side says is, well, yes, maybe they can bring these suits, but in all of those suits, they don't have counsel, what they -- what they -­",
  "And the same thing in the bar case. The -- the restriction against the sale of -- of liquor was a restriction imposed upon the person seeking to raise the third party right. But here, there's no restriction that applies to these lawyers who are seeking to raise the third party right.",
  "That's so, but we've never held what you want us to hold either, that -- that when the law does not bear upon you personally, you have the right to raise the claim of a prospective client. We've never held that either.",
  "Well, it shouldn't be cited then. You're citing it for something that the Court didn't hold.",
  "You -- I thought you were citing it here for the quite different proposition that -­ that you can raise third party rights.",
  "It's at least an argument.",
  "And even if they lose on it, they still will have -- would have raised the issue that you are most concerned about getting raised. They're not -- they're not so much interested in the so many dollars for this particular representation. Even if they lose on what seems to me at least a close argument, they will have raised the question you're trying to raise today.",
  "Who's paying them for this lawsuit?",
  "That's right. They have a shot at getting paid using this other method.",
  "Why is that? Why would a change in substantive law --",
  "-- have the same result? Suppose there's a change in -- in the antitrust law and -­ and the person says this change -- this change has the -­ the effect of -- of denying me equal protection of the law. That's the claim that the -- that the client would have. But there's a lawyer who says, my goodness, this change will mean there are many -- many fewer antitrust suits. I can demonstrate that. That's my specialty, antitrust law. I'm going to lose a lot of business. Why wouldn't he have the right to raise the equal protection claim of the prospective client?",
  "But -- but no facts -- no additional facts would -- would affect the central point that -- that we've been devoting most of this discussion to, which is whether there is an impediment or not to -­ to the -- the actual individuals whose rights your clients are asserting raising their own rights. No additional facts bear upon that it seems to me.",
  "His counsel will have raised them. And -- and most, if not all, of those have to have been raised by counsel.",
  "And you say we found no serious Sixth Amendment issue raised. Was the right of jury trial issue argued in that case, and decided?",
  "The right to jury trial is fairly clear and stark, and I just don't recall that being argued in any of those cases.",
  "Mr. Clement, here's the problem I have with the Government's argument insofar as it does not urge that we reverse Blakely, I know that you want us to do that as well. But assuming we adhere to Blakely, it seems to me you have a cure that doesn't correspond to the disease. You say that the reason the right to jury trial does not apply here is because, after all, these sentences have not been prescribed, or these maximums have not been prescribed by the legislature, but rather, have been prescribed by a quasi-judicial agency. But the right of jury trial is meant to protect against whom? Who are you worried about when you say, \"I want to be tried by a jury.\" You're not worried about the legislature, you're worried about the judges, precisely. So I don't care if the upper level of the Guidelines were actually prescribed by a court, as opposed to the Commission which is, I don't know what it is, but it's not a court. But even if it were prescribed by a court, how would that eliminate the jury trial problem? The whole reason for jury trial is we don't trust judges.",
  "Yes, but we're talking here about one precise role of the judge or of the jury, and that is, to find a fact that is necessary to keep you in jail for an additional number of years. And the difference with discretionary sentencing is if it's, you know, ten to twenty years, what you know when you do the crime is that you've laid yourself open to twenty years. Now, if you get a merciful judge, good for you, I mean, that's lagniappe as they say in Louisiana, but if you get a hanging judge, you've got twenty years, and you know that when you commit the crime, whereas we have a system now where you are entitled to no more than so much. And I find it just incompatible with jury trial right to say that that fact must be determined, before you can be kept in jail. And yet we're going let it be determined by a judge. That bears no resemblance to the discretionary sentencing system.",
  "It's not the maximum exposure. If, for example, one of the factors is whether the crime was committed with a firearm, I know that if I don't use a firearm, under the Guidelines, I can only get so many years, so somebody has to find that I used a firearm, and if I didn't, my maximum exposure is less.",
  "And each one is appealable separately, each one is appealable separately, it's a separate legal finding. And the judge doesn't, in discretionary sentencing, he doesn't have to make any factual finding, he can just look at you and say, \"I think you're a bad actor, you've got forty years.\" We have a system here where the judge must make factual findings, and each one is appealable if he's made them incorrectly.",
  "I find very little difference between telling him to evaluate it with regard to particular elements of a crime and asking him to evaluate it with regard to particular sentencing facts. The result is the same. You're asking him to evaluate it in light of certain facts that he has to find. Whether you call them the one or the other, he's doing the same thing. If he finds this fact you get three more years; if he doesn't find it, you don't. I mean, you know, as far as the real outcome is concerned, what difference does it make whether you call it an \"element\" or a \"required fact for sentencing\"?",
  "They're still in the judicial branch, right?",
  "Well, as to past. I mean, it may have a significant one-shot impact with respect to cases that were decided without Blakely in mind. But for the future, I, I just don't agree with you that changes could make some reduction. I think changes could provide for jury findings whenever, whenever there's a need for a higher sentence based on facts. I don't know; what is the problem with that?",
  "What text do you have to take out?",
  "It depends on what you mean by the \"court,\" doesn't it?",
  "Which - which is sometimes done, there are statutes that refer to the court, that -",
  "It seems to me, when there is an ambiguity that construed one way creates a constitutional statute and construed another way creates an unconstitutional one, it's an easy call.",
  "And if it can't be, maybe the judges shouldn't go, be going around guessing how many people have been defrauded. Or you know, saying \"more likely than not, on the basis of the kind of evidence we usually don't accept in criminal trials.\" Why is that okay? I don't understand it.",
  "It doesn't make me feel any good if I spend another 10 years in jail because of it. Say, \"Oh, well, don't worry about it, it wasn't an element of the crime, after all.\"",
  "Could it be that \"shall\" does not mean \"may\"? Right?",
  "Oh, that's not it? \"Shall\" -­",
  "Absolutely. Vote me for that. I mean, after all, judges used to define the elements of crimes, didn't they? And the mere fact that the elements at common law were defined by judges rather than by the legislature didn't mean that you didn't have to have a jury find them. So if courts are going to establish the guidelines, so long as they are still binding, it seems to me you still need a jury finding, or you haven't escaped Apprendi.",
  "Judicial discretionary sentencing, as I understood it, never permitted an appellate court to increase the sentence given by the district judge. Do you have any cases, where an appellate court said the district judge did not give enough years, where there was discretionary sentencing?",
  "That may be under statute, but I do not know, at common law, that when you talked about the discretion in the courts, it meant that in a criminal case a court of appeals could increase the sentence because of a -- because of an abuse of discretion by the sentencing judge. I'm unfamiliar with any such case.",
  "Except that that, as Justice O'Connor suggests, deprives the statute of its principal purpose, which was to constrain -­ to constrain judicial discretion. If there's anything clear about it, that was clear about, it was that they did not want judges to have as much discretion as they had. And now you say these things are just advisory. It seems to me much easier to -- I wanted to ask you one very precise question. Assuming I think \"court\" can mean \"jury\" -- it doesn't have to mean \"the judge\" -­ where in, in the whole guideline system, how many sections do not permit the use of \"court\" to mean \"jury\"?",
  "I think there's only one where, where it may not work.",
  "That -- that may be the one.",
  "All right. Anything else has to go?",
  "I don't know about fairer.",
  "Well, you ought to get rid of that prosecutor. That didn't seem to me very sensible at all.",
  "Does he have an entitlement to a certain number of years under any of these questions?",
  "When you're sentenced to an indeterminate sentence, he's not entitled to parole at any time -­",
  "-- is he?",
  "Mr. Kelly, I would be interested in hearing you address some of the severability problems that the Government has been raising.",
  "There might be a due process problem.",
  "Well, hasn't charge bargaining simply been replaced with fact bargaining?",
  "Well couldn't he have a sentencing phase afterwards? I don't know.",
  "Sure.",
  "Why do you -- why do you have to call it severability? Suppose we just said it's clear that whenever these facts have not been found by a jury, the guidelines cannot be applied? That the guidelines are unconstitutional, as applied, when there's been no jury finding, and leave it. We're not severing any particular language, we're just saying that that portion, that proceeding in that fashion produces an unconstitutional sentence. And then let the Government work out how it wants to find its way around that problem.",
  "I'm just not sure, I share Justice Stevens' perplexity as to whether that's really properly described as severing part of the statute.",
  "You wouldn't care whether you call this severing, severability or not, would you?",
  "I didn't think you would.",
  "And I assume, don't you, that any solution we come up to is likely to be an interim solution anyway?",
  "This will begin in 2007, as I recall. Is that -­",
  "No. That -- that's -- I said just the opposite. I said I -- I don't know why we should begin looking for this -- at this year only using this methodology. Why shouldn't we average this methodology over the previous 7 years?",
  "Do you -- do you dispute what -- what the master found here, that the methodology is more accurate on a 10-year average than it is year by year?",
  "The actual year-by-year results. Right?",
  "Yes, but I -- I -­",
  "I understand that -- that the master concluded that even as to a particular year, the model will be more accurate if you use the average from the previous 10 years than if you just applied the model to a single year, that even as to the real results for that single year, the model will be more accurate if you use a 10-year average.",
  "I -- I thought that the compact specifically provided there shall be no allowance or accumulation of credits or debits for or against either State.",
  "Well, how does that comport with what you just said?",
  "Well, if it's not a credit for accounting purposes, then they're going to owe you just as much the next year even though -- even though you had more water the previous year.",
  "Yes.",
  "Why don't you do it on a monthly basis? Indeed, why don't you do it on a daily basis? I mean, the master found that this model really works if you -- if you stretch it out over 10 years. You say 1 year. Why don't you do it month by month?",
  "As I understand the system you propose, the river master's decision would be appealable to us, and we would review it de novo. Is that right?",
  "I'm very loathe to deprive either of the States of their -- their right to have this Court decide matters between them.",
  "Well, it would if they can only come here and -- and overturn the river master if he's clearly erroneous. That's a -- that's a very high standard.",
  "I -- I had thought that your proposal was de novo review. This is -- this is new to me, that -- that you want it clearly erroneous.",
  "That was the deal.",
  "That was the deal they came to. Why should we kick it over? They came to that arrangement, and it was approved by Congress, and now you come back and tell us, oh, this is too cumbersome. You should -- you should appoint this river master to do an end run around it. I -- I -- it doesn't seem to me to be fair.",
  "Well, the disputes are going to come up here eventually anyway if the States are intransigent. Ultimately it will be a dispute about the application of the compact and it will come back here anyway, won't it?",
  "Binding arbitration will -­ will mercifully keep this stuff off of our desk, won't it?",
  "So I guess we made a mistake with respect to the Pecos River and what was the other one? Delaware?",
  "Mr. Feldman, the Government takes no position on this 1-year versus 10-year computation?",
  "Too hard for you?",
  "This is a lot of money involved, and -- and you certainly didn't argue it here. I don't recall that point being argued. And with all that money being involved, I would have thought it would have been argued.",
  "Well, that wouldn't relate to the question presented here, anyway. It wouldn't relate to the reason for which we took this case.",
  "I mean, maybe the district court misinterpreted or misapplied \"fairly and in good faith\" if it didn't consider the logo-like use. But, as I understand it, the only question we have before us is whether the \"fairly and in good faith\" provision is an exception even when there is confusion.",
  "Could you give us a -- I'd be much more sympathetic to your case if I could readily envision a situation where there is confusion but, nonetheless, the use is fair and in good faith. Give me a clear example.",
  "No. I mean, make up one -­",
  "-- that's really clear.",
  "I don't think there's any likelihood of confusion there, do you? I mean -­",
  "-- what if he just takes out an ad that says, \"Best Buy,\" exclamation point? That would be closer.",
  "I didn't mean to make it that in my hypothetical. You're just putting it in bold type at the beginning of the piece, \"Best Buy,\" exclamation point. That means it's a trademark?",
  "Right.",
  "Well, you have to weigh in on it. I mean, you have to show that the -- it seems to me, if you think that side should win, that the words are being used in a descriptive sense. And if \"micro color\" doesn't mean a blessed thing to anybody unless they associate it with the trademark, then, it seems to me, you lose.",
  "You're right, that's not the issue in the case.",
  "You're right.",
  "In other words, if you choose to use a descriptive term as your logo, you take your chances -­",
  "-- that that descriptive term will be used fairly and in good faith by somebody else and cause confusion.",
  "And if you don't want confusion, pick a term that isn't descriptive.",
  "\"Schwartz,\" \"Schwartz\" candy bars.",
  "It doesn't do anything for you.",
  "How can you use a fanciful term descriptively? I mean, I think that's the definition of an arbitrary or fanciful term, that it doesn't mean anything.",
  "Did you object to the formulation of the question presented? Here's the question, \"Does the classic fair-use defense to trademark infringement require the party asserting the defense to demonstrate an absence of likelihood of confusion?\" That's the question. And you say, \"no.\"",
  "Exactly.",
  "Excuse me, this still goes to the merits of the defense and not to the question presented. The question presented is, descriptive or not descriptive, do you have a defense if it's, if there is consumer confusion? And your position, if you're opposing the question presented, is that if there is consumer confusion, there is no defense. And it's -- I thought that was the only question you were going to discuss here, not in fact whether, if there is such a defense, it has been made out in this case, because these words were or were not descriptive. I mean, that's a -­",
  "But we don't usually interpret statutes that way. I mean, you tell us what Congress had in mind, but our best indication of what Congress had in mind is the words of the statute. And the words of the statute make no sense if they say you have to prove confusion and the only -- however, there's a special defense which you have, which turns out to be there's no confusion, that's not a special defense.",
  "Makes it a meaningless statute, really.",
  "That may well be, but I don't think that's the question presented here. I mean, we could agree with that, that it's relevant to deciding the defense, and still answer the question presented the way that the Petitioner wants.",
  "They might have been afraid that you'd sue them.",
  "I forget your position, if you've taken it, do you agree that the degree of confusion that is predictable or that is likely is one of the elements that can be used to determine whether the use is a fair one? Do you agree or disagree with that?",
  "All right, that's all I wanted to know.",
  "Well, we didn't leave it up to the States entirely. I mean, you -- you mean the States could adopt any definition of mental retardation they want?",
  "So there's -- there's some minimal level of mental retardation. Right?",
  "And isn't that necessarily over-inclusive, just as picking any single age is necessarily over-inclusive?",
  "Surely there will be some people who -- who, although they have that level of mental retardation, with regard to the particular crime in question, are deserving of the death penalty.",
  "Why pick -- why pick on the death penalty? I mean, if you're going to say that somehow people under 18 are juveniles for all purposes, why -- why just pick on the death penalty? Why -- why not say they're immune from any criminal penalty?",
  "I'm sure that -- I'm sure that would follow. I -- I don't see where there's a logical line.",
  "Well, what's -- what's the -­",
  "What is the contrary of -- of mitigating? I -- I would assume -­",
  "Is it? I -- I would assume it's not mitigating.",
  "Maybe the opposite of mitigating is aggravating, but it -- it's perfectly good English to say, mitigating? Quite the contrary -­",
  "It's not at all mitigating.",
  "So I don't know why you give that one away.",
  "Have the countries of the European Union abolished the death penalty by popular vote?",
  "I thought they did it by reason of a judgment of a court -­",
  "-- which required all of them to abolish it.",
  "And I thought that some of the public opinion polls in -- in a number of the countries support the death penalty.",
  "You -- you think --",
  "What did John Adams think of the French?",
  "Does adolescence as a scientific term -- does it always occur on the same day for -- for all individuals?",
  "Can the constitutional calculus ever move in the other direction? I mean, once we hold that, you know, 16 is the age, if there's new scientific evidence that shows that some people are quite mature at 18 or at -- at 17-and-a-half or if -- if there is a -- a new feeling among the people that youthful murderers are, indeed, a serious problem and -- and deterrence is necessary, can we ever go back?",
  "It's sort of a one-way ratchet. Isn't it?",
  "We don't -- we don't use 18 for everything. Aren't there States that -- that allow adolescents to drive at the age of 16?",
  "With their parents' consent -­",
  "With their parents' consent, how many?",
  "But they can drive.",
  "If it's okay with the parents, it's okay with the State.",
  "They have a lot of customs that we don't have. They don't allow most -- almost all of them do not allow -- have trial by jury. Should we -- and they think it's not only more efficient, it is fairer because juries are, you know, unpredictable and whatnot. Should we yield to the views of the rest of the world?",
  "If all of this is so clear, why can't the State legislature take it into account?",
  "I mean, if it's such an overwhelming case that -- that we can prescribe it for the whole country, you would expect that the number of States that -- that now permit it would not permit it. All you have to do is bring these facts to the attention of the legislature, and they can investigate the accuracy of the studies that the American Psychological Association does or other associations in a manner that we can't. We just have to read whatever you put in front of us.",
  "But that's precisely because the jury considers youthfulness as one of the mitigating factors. It doesn't surprise me that the death penalty for 16- to 18-year-olds is rarely imposed. I would expect it would be. But it -- it's a question of whether you leave it to the jury to evaluate the person's youth and take that into account or whether you adopt a hard rule that nobody who is under 18 is -- is -- has committed such a heinous crime with such intent that he -- that he deserves the death penalty.",
  "Mr. Waxman, I -- I thought we punish people, criminals, for what they were, not for what they are. I mean, you know, if you have someone who commits a heinous crime and by the time he's brought to trial and convicted, he's come to Jesus, we don't let him off because he's not now what he was then. It seems to me we punish people for what they were.",
  "And to say that adolescents change, everybody changes, but that doesn't justify eliminating the -- the proper punishments that society has determined.",
  "Whereas if it had been done by an 18-year-old, a jury could have said that.",
  "If an 18-year-old did the same thing, you say, well, he's certainly stable.",
  "But this Court held only 3 years ago that the statute before us here does not permit the Attorney General to hold the alien indefinitely.",
  "But this statute just -- just goes in a circle because it ends. The way end -- (A) ends is that after revoking the parole, the alien shall forthwith return or be returned to the custody from which he was paroled and thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the United States, which refers you back to -- to 1231(a)(6).",
  "Well, this shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant -­",
  "Dealt with includes, it seems to me, 1231(a)(6).",
  "By which you mean -- parole statute, by which you mean?",
  "Okay.",
  "That's an interpretation.",
  "It says -- that's an interpretation.",
  "It says the statute does not confer power to hold beyond a reasonable period.",
  "Mr. Kneedler -­",
  "Mr. Kneedler, may I -- may I try to get in the question I did earlier? Is -- is 8 U.S.C., section 1182(d)(5) -- was -- was that applicable in Zadvydas, as it's applicable here?",
  "So this is a new string to your bow in this case.",
  "Before you get to that, do you think that that's the only statute applicable here? What about 1182(d)(5)? What's your response to the Government's assertion that that's an independent basis?",
  "And there's no -- and -- and there's no answer to Justice Souter's question with regard to people who -- who -- once they enter that way. Right?",
  "Except a new statute.",
  "Just normal, harmless criminals.",
  "Right?",
  "But this -- this regime is not sending, you know, an armed flotilla to Florida. They just --",
  "-- they just open their jails and say, hey, you know, go wherever you want. And these people say I want to get out of here, and they go to Florida. You -- you want us -­",
  "-- to bomb Cuba because of that.",
  "It might have been a -- a means of warning Congress off one area, but not the other. That is to say, just because we think there's a constitutional doubt here and therefore Congress might be sailing close to the wind if they tried to overrule our opinion by statute doesn't mean that Congress couldn't in this other area alter the result in Zadvydas.",
  "Of course, I dissented in that case. So I'm not saying this was a good idea.",
  "Well, now, that -- that definition, used or capable of being used -- right, now. After one of the hurricanes, I saw a -- a tugboat that had just been washed up on shore down in the Gulf. What if somebody -- some enterprising person had fitted that out like a -- like a diner, you know, a -- a restaurant and they have staff in the diner and they're serving the meals off of this boat? Now, the boat, apart from the fact that it's a couple of hundred yards inland, is capable of being -- still capable of being used. Are the employees of that diner covered by the Jones Act?",
  "It -- it goes to whether we want to use, you know, section 3 as -- as our definition.",
  "So you say it is a vessel. I thought your answer before was that it was not a vessel because it's not practically capable of being used.",
  "I -- I like Justice Ginsburg's answer better.",
  "It is a vessel but it's not in navigation. Then you could stick with the -- with the section 3 definition. It's capable of being used, so it's a vessel, but -­",
  "Precisely? So then the -­",
  "So you -- you think that the person who operates the dredge, since he's not navigating the vessel, is not covered by the Jones Act?",
  "You do not what? Do not think he's covered by the Jones Act?",
  "He is covered. Well, then why isn't the croupier covered?",
  "Why isn't the croupier covered, you know?",
  "That vessel's function is gambling. He sure is.",
  "What if you have a very complicated dredge and it takes two people? One of them does nothing but -- but operate the steam shovel that pulls up the goop and puts it in the -- in the barges. Okay? And the other one moves the dredge. You say the one is -- is covered by the Jones Act and the other one isn't? No, it can't be. If the function of the vessel is dredging, anybody who is performing that function of dredging is covered by the Jones Act. Don't you believe that?",
  "Of course, you do. So the croupier is -­",
  "Oh, that's not even close.",
  "I mean, it carries all this goop somewhere else to -- to dump it. Right?",
  "Why is that reading anything in? I mean, do -- do you think if -- if you were not practically capable, you would be capable?",
  "I don't regard that as a reading in at all. I mean, capable means capable. You're either capable or not. If you practically can't be moved, your're not capable.",
  "But that goes to in navigation -­",
  "-- not to whether it's a vessel or not. It is still a vessel even if it's beached up on land so long as it is capable of -- of floating. It's just not in navigation, isn't it?",
  "Yes, but I think what the Government has said is that though it's in navigation, we have a case that says that the -- that the seaman's connection to the ship has to be related to the functioning of the ship in navigation. He doesn't have to navigate it, but he has to be working at what the ship does in the course of its navigation, and a dredge operator does that.",
  "Not to the navigating part but to what the vessel is doing in the course of its being in navigation.",
  "It happens every -- every 86 years they have one of these storms.",
  "I -- I guess I could agree with you if -- if I believed that I had to look to the primary purpose, whether the primary purpose of the vessel was transportation. But what -- what do you do about gambling ships that, you know, they -- they sail out beyond the 2­ mile limit and then come right back to where they left? Now, people get on board not to get transported. They get on board to gamble. And the purpose of the ship, the primary purpose of the ship, is gambling. You think that -- that -- the -- the seamen who -- who are on that ship, which regularly goes out beyond the 2-mile limit, you think that they're -- that they're not covered by the Jones Act?",
  "I don't think it's close at all. I think they're obviously covered by the Jones Act.",
  "But -- but that's not the primary purpose of -- of the ship, just as the primary purpose of this scow is -- of -- of this dredge is not transportation.",
  "Oh, a primary purpose? Now, you're getting a little fuzzy there. I thought you said the primary purpose.",
  "It has to be a primary purpose.",
  "A. Oh.",
  "And you think that's not fuzzy.",
  "Is it -- is it the vessel that's the problem? Why -- why do you focus on the vessel? It seems to me most of your argument has gone to whether it's in navigation. Can you be a vessel that is not in navigation?",
  "Of course, you can or you wouldn't have the -- the combination of the two terms appearing anywhere. So why isn't the problem here not whether it's a vessel but whether it's in navigation?",
  "That's of annual income. Right? 2 percent of -- of the person's annual income?",
  "For the year.",
  "But, gee, in the case of a -­ of a major award, that 2 percent is very likely to be exceeded, isn't it?",
  "So this is a problem that's going to exist even -- even after the alternate minimum tax is abolished. Right?",
  "Well, you don't think -- the Government doesn't think it's a problem. I'm talking about taking a huge percentage of the -- of the person's recovery. That -- that will happen even -- even in the case where there's no minimum tax -- alternative.",
  "Suppose -- suppose the same amount were paid, as was paid here, to the attorney, but it was not by way of a contingent fee, that the -- the client had committed to pay this dollar amount in a dollar amount.",
  "As a flat fee. What -- what would the tax treatment of that be?",
  "Well, you -- you don't need a transfer of the -- I don't understand what you mean -­",

You just say that's part of the transaction, and it goes onto the basis of your property. Right?",
  "Why isn't -- why isn't that very similar to this? I mean, what difference does it make whether there's a -- there's a transaction here, isn't there? Isn't there a transaction?",
  "Yes, but a -- the service is connected to a transaction, namely the conversion of the chosen action into a money payment. You have this -­",

  "Can I -- can I ask you a question relating to the Davenport -- what's been referred to as the Davenport theory? I had thought that -- that the service has used the -- the transaction theory with regard to legal fees payable for a lawsuit seeking increased compensation for the condemnation of real estate where the taxpayer had objected to the amount that the condemning entity was offering and brought suit in court and with a contingent fee to the lawyer and that the service treated that as -- as part of the transaction cost. Am I wrong about that?",

His legal fees were, by the IRS, subtracted from the award, and he was taxed only upon the proceeds reduced by the legal fees. Now, how do you explain that situation there?",

Why would you force that course on the -- on the lawyer? If the lawyer believes that the silence implies consent, as -- as silence usually does, why not let the lawyer do what's in the client's best interest?",

  "Presumably, if we punish this person this way, Canada wouldn't -- there's no double jeopardy, right?",
  "So we'd be punishing this person for violating Canadian law, and then Canada would punish this person for violating Canadian law.",
  "This statute applied against people who defraud the United States Government in taxes?",
  "But you don't -- you don't know of any prosecutions under this fraud statute for depriving the Federal Government of property.",
  "Was it -- was it phrased the same way it is in your brief, in the petition?",
  "Well, then the last part of it --",
  "-- obviously covers it.",
  "Well, why didn't you prosecute him for that?",
  "But that's -- but that's a reason for extending the statute to everything, to everything - -",
  "-- reading \"property\" to mean anything at all. I mean, what you're saying is, the broader you read this statute, the more bad guys we're going to catch. I'll stipulate that. Of course it's true.",
  "What about evading a Cuban tax law that we think -- that many people would think is an unjust tax law? I mean, one of the things I'm worried about is that this gets us into foreign policy. Are you sure that we always want to enforce the tax laws of foreign countries through this fraud statute, no matter what those tax laws happen to be?",
  "It may well, but when it comes here, this Court is going to have to decide -- we'll just approve whatever you want to prosecute and let you not prosecute whatever you want?",
  "The question comes down to whether this statute, which doesn't have to be read that way, ought to be read that way, whether it makes sense to read it that way. What about -- does Canada have an income tax?",
  "Well, let's assume - -",
  "-- Canada has an income tax. Would you -- would you prosecute a Canadian who files a deceptive Canadian income tax return?",
  "No, no, no, from this country. He's -- you know, he's a snow goose and is in Florida when he files his return.",
  "Yeah.",
  "How long has this statute been on the books, this wire fraud statute? Pretty old statute.",
  "How many prosecutions like this have there been? When was the first one?",
  "For, you know, using the mails or interstate commerce to defraud a foreign government of taxes?",
  "More common, or didn't exist at all before the 19- -- do you know of any case before - -",
  "-- before the 1980s?",
  "Doesn't that suggest to you that the statute isn't naturally read to cover stuff like that?",
  "We didn't have smugglers before then?",
  "What's the second reason?",
  "Okay. Well, and you have arguments against both of those two. Which arguments are at least -- at least -- arguable? What about a third rule, the rule of lenity?",
  "If we -- if we are unsure, if it's a close question whether it's property, if it's a close question whether we're enforcing the tax laws of Canada by prosecuting somebody for violating the tax laws of Canada, if that's a closed question, why doesn't the rule of lenity apply?",
  "The restitution statute is not ambiguous at all; whereas, this statute has a number of ambiguities in it. And if I had to find my way out of the restitution problem, I would pick the ambiguous statute to get out, rather than simply saying, \"Well, though this restitution statute says this categorically, we will ignore it, because if we didn't ignore it, we would be enforcing the revenue laws of another country.\" There's nothing against enforcing the revenue laws of another country, if we want to; this is just a question of statutory interpretation. Should this ambiguous statute be interpreted that way? If Congress said, \"We're going to enforce Canada's tax laws,\" there's nothing wrong with that. But - -",
  "So you have two statutes. One of them seems to be quite ambiguous. The other one is categorical, you get restitution in all cases. Now, how do I wiggle out of it?",
  "Obviously, I wiggle out of it with the ambiguous statute.",
  "But you haven't told me -- you haven't told me how you get out of the restitution statute. There's no ambiguity there, and it is not a rule of law that you can't -- it's unconstitutional to enforce the tax laws of Canada. Since it's entirely feasible, and since the text is categorical, how do you get out of the restitution statute?",
  "We haven't told -- no, no, no, no, no, no, we're not telling Congress, \"You can't do what you have done.\" We're saying, \"Congress hasn't done this.\"",
  "Well -- I'm sorry.",
  "No, you.",
  "I was about to say the same - - the same thing. You keep saying there are no cases that do this. Are there -- are there -- are there cases, before 1980, which do what you want to do -- that is, to use our fraud law, or something, to effectively enforce Canada's -- or some foreign country's tax law?",
  "No.",
  "But they are used. I mean, we don't have to make it up. From cases we've had here, we know that they're used in places like bus depots to -- to sniff luggage that -- that passengers have carried through on -- on buses.",
  "And the republic seems to have survived.",
  "No. These aren't sniffs for - - for explosives. These are sniffs for drugs and -- and these -- these are not buses that are coming in from France. They're coming in from one American city to another. And -- and there's no more need in -- in that case than there was in this case. It was just a good -- a good place to find criminals who were carrying unlawful drugs.",
  "Inadvertently.",
  "Not necessarily.",
  "I think you should use it.",
  "Why -- why do you -- are you sure that Kyllo, you know, the -- the imaging case, would have come out the same way if the only thing -- the only thing -- that the imaging could pick out is not any of the other private activities in the home, but the only thing it could possibly discern is a dead body with a knife through the heart? Are you sure the case would have come out the same way? I'm not at all sure.",
  "Or if that happened a large percentage of the time. I mean, surely you'd concede that the search is unreasonable if, for every -- every one time, you -- you make somebody open his bag because the dog actually smells narcotics, 99 times you make somebody open his bag because he has apples in it. I mean, wouldn't that go to the reasonableness of - -",
  "Yes.",
  "A nice turn of phrase, as I recall.",
  "Wasn't there -- didn't Kyllo - - wasn't what -- what the Court was worried about in Kyllo not just the relatively crude heat imaging that existed in the case before it, but the prospect of more and more sophisticated heat imaging which -- which we had evidence was already in development that would enable you to see people moving around a room? I thought the case referred to that. Now, are we going to have more and more - - what's going to happen with dogs? I -- I can't imagine that -- that this thing is going anywhere other than smelling narcotics and smelling bombs.",
  "Do you agree with -- with General Madigan that it doesn't make any difference whether the -- the dog is a -- is a mechanical instrument or not? Do you agree it makes no difference? I thought that one of the -- one of the points in -- in the imaging case was that this was a new technology which didn't exist and that although the ordinary rules in 1791 was that there was no search unless -- you know, unless you enter the house or unless you - - you physically intrude upon the person's -- at least the person's clothes, we made an exception to that rule because of this new technology that enabled you to find out things without having to intrude into the home or into the person. Now, but -- but this is not a new technology. This is a dog and -- and they had that ability in 1791 just as they had it today. And the rule that when there's no intrusion, there's no search -- there's no reason to depart from that rule with respect to a dog although there would be with respect to some sophisticated new technology that would enable you to find out all sorts of things.",
  "It seems to me you shouldn't - - you shouldn't assume that -- that the fact that this is a canine makes no difference.",
  "You don't know that, do you?",
  "But that didn't go to whether it was a search or seizure. I think it goes to whether it was an unreasonable search or seizure. Don't you think so? That what -- what might be unreasonable with respect to a home would not be unreasonable with respect to a suitcase?",
  "Of course, we could separate the home from the -- from what happened here and still validate the search here if we held that it was a search, but was a reasonable one since all you find is that the person was carrying contraband. It's the only thing that's disclosed. Whereas, if you -- if you did the same thing with -- with regard to a house, which is a more sacrosanct part of one's privacy, it might be an unreasonable search. We -- we could reach that result if we wanted to, couldn't we?",
  "Why -- why do you say that? I mean, is -- is anything that I observe a search? I mean, suppose I -- I'm a policeman and -- and I'm looking out for, I don't know, people with a nervous tic because I think that that might be somebody who's about to commit a crime or has committed a crime. Have I searched that person because I -- I observe something external?",
  "Is there no difference between an investigation and a search?",
  "No. It seems to me your brief and -- and your statement here both seem to assume that there's a search whenever the police investigate.",
  "But that's not so. They -- one can investigate without searching.",
  "Suppose a policeman follows me around. He just -- just follows me around, observing with his -- with plain eyes, nothing else. Now, is that a search? Does he need probable cause to do that? Now, he's wasting his time and he's wasting public money and maybe he should get fired for doing it, if he has no reason to follow me.",
  "And maybe -- maybe I'd have a harassment action against him if he does it, you know, blatantly. But is that a search?",
  "Okay. So -- so the mere fact that one is in investigating something doesn't make it a search. What does make it a search?",
  "The fact that you find out something?",
  "You think it would be better if he hadn't been stopped? If -- if they just -- just randomly walked up to somebody who was going through a toll booth and had the dog sniff the car, you think that would be a better case - -",
  "-- for allowing it than -- than yours?",
  "He does that. He does that.",
  "Yes, in this case.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Would it be bad? Would it be bad if that's what he did?",
  "Mr. Meczyk, I assume that your answer to whether it's lawful to have a -- a dog at a bus depot just to sniff the bags of people who were coming off, without stopping them, but just -- just to have the dogs there, that's unlawful.",
  "For narcotics, not for bombs, not for -- just -- just for narcotics. The police think, you know, a lot of narcotics goes on interstate buses. We're going to put a dog in the bus depot.",
  "Why?",
  "Well, so is the road, for Pete's sake.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Okay. That's -- that's what I think you should say.",
  "I mean, I think it's worse if -- if you're subjected to it without having committed any violation at all. Every time I travel abroad and come back into the country, customs officers have dogs and - - and they parade the dogs through -- through the baggage terminal. Do -- do I feel offended by that?",
  "This isn't a public safety matter. They're -- they're not smelling for bombs. They're -- they're smelling for contraband. And according to you, that is bad.",
  "Okay. A bus station is different, though.",
  "But it's not an interstate commerce that you want to foster. I mean, in these other -- in these other cases, Congress presumably wanted to foster interstate commerce in wheat, in Wickard v. Filburn. Congress doesn't want interstate commerce in marijuana. And it seems rather ironic to appeal to the fact that home-grown marijuana would reduce the interstate commerce that you don't want to occur in order to regulate it. I mean, you know, doesn't that strike you as strange?",
  "Absolutely.",
  "But that's quite a different rational than from Wickard v. Filburn. I mean, it seems to me you're not -- you're not appealing to the fact that it has a substantial impact on interstate commerce. You're appealing to the fact that the power which Congress has to prohibit the use of goods carried in interstate commerce cannot effectively be implemented without this law.",
  "Involved economic activity.",
  "Well, you know, Congress has applied this theory in other contexts. One is the protection of endangered species. Congress has made it unlawful to possess ivory, for example. It doesn't matter whether you got it lawfully, or not; or eagle feathers, the mere possession of it, whether you got it through interstate commerce or not. And Congress' reasoning is, \"We can't tell whether it came through interstate commerce or not, and to try to prove that is just beyond our ability; and, therefore, it is unlawful to possess it, period.\" Now, are those -- are those laws, likewise, unconstitutional, as going beyond Congress' commerce power?",
  "Well, why is that different from this?",
  "Isolated and -- I understand that there are some communes that grow marijuana for the medical use of all of the members of the communes.",
  "No, but it's before the Court when you -- when you raise the policing of the problem by California, and saying it's not a -- it's not a real problem, you brought it before the Court.",
  "Which is -- which is what?",
  "An individual grower?",
  "Gee, what basis - -",
  "-- what basis is there to draw it that narrowly? I mean, I guess if we -- we could say people whose last name begins with a Z. You know, that would narrow the category, too. But why does -- why does that make any sense?",
  "Oh, but California hasn't identified individual growers. Communes are okay, as far as California law is concerned.",
  "Why wouldn't it be?",
  "No, no, they're not buying and selling. I mean, you can't prove they're buying and selling. There are just a whole lot of people there, with alleged medical needs.",
  "Well, we didn't decide that, in Lopez, on the basis of whether the gun had come in interstate commerce. If the statute in question had applied only to guns that had been transported in interstate commerce, the case might have come out differently.",
  "Sounds like Wickard to me.",
  "I always used to laugh at Wickard, but that's -- that's what Wickard said.",
  "Had he not eaten the wheat, it would have been in interstate commerce.",
  "Well, that's what it was about, as far as the Court's analysis was concerned. To be sure, there were a lot of -- there was a lot more use of the wheat on his farm, other than just human consumption, but it seems to me the analysis of the case said, \"You take it -- you take it out of the stream of commerce by growing it yourself, you make it unnecessary for your -- to buy it in interstate commerce.\"",
  "Strange phrase, to mean \"feeding to livestock\"?",
  "\"Home-consumed\" is feed it to your pig?",
  "I don't think so.",
  "Well, why is this not economic activity, if you use the term in that broad sense? This marijuana that is grown, just like the wheat that was grown, in Wickard, since it's grown on the farm, doesn't have to be bought elsewhere, and that makes it an economic activity.",
  "Again, I don't think that's - - that faithfully represents what the opinion said. I think the opinion covered -- including the amount that he consumed himself, and his family consumed.",
  "Did the opinion make a point of that?",
  "Did the opinion make a point of that?",
  "I don't think it was a point of the Court's analysis at all.",
  "Could I -- could I - -",
  "Remote, remote, remote economic effect.",
  "Mr. Mitchell, my -- my problem is even more fundamental than Justice Souter's. Conceding that the rule in Mississippi is exactly the same as the Federal rule in Beck, it doesn't seem to me that arguing Mississippi law, just because it happens to be the same as Federal law, amounts to raising a Federal question. Let's assume you have a -- a State law against wire-tapping. It is unlawful. And you -- you come in and you ask that the evidence be -- be excluded because it's contrary to the State law. Have you raised a -- a Federal -- a Federal question when all you cite is the State law, even though the effect under State law is the same as the Federal effect under the Fourth Amendment? It's not my understanding that you've raised a Federal question.",
  "That's all it takes for the New York State Supreme Court, for example, to have said, well, you know, our -- our wire-tap statute does the same thing as the Fourth Amendment does anyway? That's all it takes?",
  "Thereafter, all you have to do is cite the New York State statute, and you've raised a Federal question.",
  "Well, I mean, if -- but the State standard always has to -- has to comply with the Federal requirement, doesn't it?",
  "So all it takes is a -- is a single decision by the State supreme court which says that our rule is no broader than the Federal constitutional requirement, and thereafter all you have to do is appeal to State law.",
  "Of course - -",
  "-- it does. Why -- why is that -- I mean, it seems to me counsel should stand up on his two feet and say, we're raising a Federal question. Why is that too much of an imposition when the statute requires that you raise a Federal question? Why do we have to go researching what the State supreme court said several years ago?",
  "So we have to figure out in every case whether the two claims are interwoven. Do you think -- do you think counsel for the defense isn't always going to say that they're interwoven?",
  "I don't think it's too much to ask counsel for the defense to say, we are raising a Federal question. And it solves the problem.",
  "I don't get your point. It doesn't have to be a -- a lesser-included offense - -",
  "-- so long as it's a lesser offense?",
  "Wait. You're -- you're -- I don't -- you're calling the heat of passion an element of -- of the crime of manslaughter? It's not an element of the crime.",
  "Suppose you walk up and -- and you blow somebody away. You can't -- there's no heat of passion. There's no sudden provocation. You just walk up and blow them away. And you're telling me that that's not a crime because you can't -- you can't prove heat of passion? You can't prove one of the other elements of manslaughter? That can't be right.",
  "Why isn't it enough that you killed somebody?",
  "You killed somebody. You didn't plan to kill to somebody, so it's not murder. Okay. But you killed somebody. Surely, there must be some crime in -- in Mississippi that -- that covers that.",
  "What is it?",
  "No. It's not murder. It wasn't -- you know, he didn't -- I didn't walk up to the -- to the car intending to kill him. As you say, you couldn't have indicted for murder.",
  "There -- there is a -- you say there -- there are what? Nine different manslaughter, did you say?",
  "Twelve different, and one of them is simply killing somebody simpliciter, without any provocation. Right?",
  "I think you confuse us by saying that. If you just left that out of your statement, felony murder is killing in the course of a crime. Don't say anything about intent. Intent is not an element of felony murder. Right?",
  "So if you want to get plain murder, you're adding an element.",
  "It has to be murder with intent, and that's why you say it's not a lesser-included offense because for plain murder, you need intent, and for felony murder, you don't need intent.",
  "Isn't that -- isn't that your case?",
  "I thought -- I thought that Cannon -- we've -- we've allowed Cannon to stay on the books, but I thought we have sworn off the kind of creation of -- of implied remedies that Cannon exemplifies.",
  "It's very -- it's very useful, I'm sure, but it -- it could be very disruptive also, I am sure. If I were -- if I were a coach, one of the first things -- especially a coach of a women's team in high school, one of the first things I would do would be to complain about not -- not getting enough facilities. This would make it a lot more difficult to fire me whether - - whether I'm a lousy coach or not. You -- you would have to think twice before you fire me because I would have a retaliation claim.",
  "Some of them specifically provide for retaliation, don't they?",
  "Why do they do that if, as you assert, the mere word discrimination embraces it?",
  "Do you think that it -- it is a reasonable description of what happened -- he was fired for complaining about his girls' team not getting enough facilities -- that he was, on the basis of sex, excluded from participation in, denied benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under an education program?",
  "Do you think that -- that remotely describes what happened to this coach?",
  "Yes, but it's separate enough from discrimination that in other statutes, although Congress does create a cause of action for discrimination, it goes out of its way to create a separate cause of action for retaliation. It's sufficiently separate, and if it is that sufficiently separate, it doesn't seem to me that you could clearly say that -- that when the State signed on to receiving Federal funds under title IX, they should have known that this door to litigation was being opened to them. Yes, litigation for -- for discrimination against -- against female athletes, but not -- not discrimination suits alleging retaliation. That's a whole, new area.",
  "That could be because - -",
  "-- the sanction is so draconian that nobody in his right mind is not going to rehire the coach. Of course, they're going to rehire. I -- I find it hard to believe why a draconian sanction is ineffective.",
  "It seems to me it's -- it's overwhelmingly effective. You tell the school you either rehire the coach or we're cutting off your money.",
  "Is it hard to decide what they're going to do?",
  "It rules out this one, but it doesn't rule out the main -- look it, this is a weird kind of retaliation claim. Usually the retaliation claim is the person who has been discriminated against complains about the discrimination, and for that complaint, the person who was discriminated against is demoted or not promoted, or whatever. That's -- that's the classic retaliation claim. And that classic claim is surely covered by -- on the basis of that person's sex. If - -",
  "What was the date of the Sullivan case?",
  "And -- and you think that we take the same approach to implied causes of action today that we took in 1969?",
  "I don't know what case it is, but one of our cases, the argument was precisely made that the statute before us had been enacted by Congress before we had set our face against implied causes of action, and therefore, we should interpret that statute the way we used to in 1969, and we rejected that argument. We said that our new rule, as to when you find implied causes of action, will be applied to all statutes, whether they were enacted by a Congress that -- that thought we would go skipping along forever as we did in 1969 or -- or not. And -- and that's what you're asking us to do here.",
  "Just because Congress in -- in the -- at the time this statute was enacted believed in the existence of a Supreme Court that would readily find implied causes of action, we -- we have to do that for all these old statutes.",
  "And that's where you hang. You -- you really think Congress, when it enacted title IX, paid close attention and said -- instead of saying no person in the United States shall on the basis of that person's sex be excluded from participation, you think somebody had -- had suggested that language, and they said, oh, no, no, no, that would make it too narrow. We have to take out that person's. I -- I don't -- it doesn't strike me as a -- as an obvious import of not including the word that person's sex. It's a very natural way to write it: no person in the United States shall on the basis of sex.",
  "Are punitive damages available under title IX?",
  "The regulations didn't say anything about a private cause of action, did it?",
  "And the statute didn't say anything about a private cause of action.",
  "Is this a civil rights statute that provides for a private cause of action? I -- I want to know what the hypothetical is.",
  "There were some later cases that cast a good deal of doubt on whether we would apply Cannon anymore.",
  "Do we know that? I mean, do we have any idea how effective the enforcement of OCR is? Just because they haven't cut off funds - -",
  "-- they may well not have cut off funds because anybody who gets a directive from them will hop to it.",
  "And do they call more than infrequently?",
  "You -- you don't concede the point that it is the role of this Court to determine whether agencies are inefficient or not - -",
  "-- and if they are inefficient to -- to raise up private attorneys general to -- to fill the void?",
  "Other statutes do it separately.",
  "Other statutes don't view the one as -- as being incorporated in the other.",
  "There are no vagaries in private enforcement. Private attorneys general always act in the interest of the whole polity. There are no vagaries there.",
  "Is that the only basis for venue? I mean, I thought the statute provides that's just one of the bases for venue.",
  "But -- but read it. What does it say?",
  "I -- I mean, one can understand that if the venue provision just read, a prosecution may be brought in any -- in -- let's see -- may be brought in the district where venue would lie for the completed -- if it just read, venue will lie in any district where an act in furtherance of the attempt or conspiracy took place, then we could argue about whether that is the exclusive venue or not. But I don't see how there is even an argument that it's the exclusive venue when you're dealing with a provision which says that a prosecution may be brought in the district where the -- where venue would lie for the completed offense or in any other district where an act in furtherance took place. How can you possibly read that to say that the exclusive venue is a place where an act in furtherance took place?",
  "Oh, okay, but -- but then - - then you acknowledge that the place where an overt act took place is not the exclusive venue.",
  "Except that there are other statutes that -- that read this way, which we have held to -- to create the conspiracy offense, as well as impose the penalty for it.",
  "I mean, it -- it could do that. Any person who conspires to commit any offense defined in this section shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense. And that could be deemed to create the conspiracy offense and prescribe the penalty for it.",
  "And there are other such provisions, aren't there?",
  "Let's get - -",
  "If that's so -- if that's so, then why does the venue provision which you were just alluding to earlier read, except as provided in paragraph (2), a prosecution for an offense under this section. An offense under this section or section 1957 may be brought in -- and then it says -- (2) a prosecution for an attempt or a conspiracy offense under this section. Not under section 371, but a prosecution for an attempt or a conspiracy offense under this section.",
  "I -- I think that language really cuts very hard against you. A conspiracy offense under this section. It -- it is reading as though that's the section that defines the offense, not just the section that provides the penalty.",
  "Only because I'm a reasonable man.",
  "Can I -- can I ask what you make of subsection (d) of -- of this provision which says that violations of this section may be investigated by such components of the Department of Justice as the Attorney General may direct and by such components of the Department of the Treasury as the Secretary of the Treasury may direct, as appropriate, and with respect to offenses over which the Postal Service has jurisdiction, by the Postal Service? Apparently there was some turf war going on as to who had jurisdiction over these offenses and -- and this was meant to -- to solve the turf war, but it reads violations of this section. Now, does that allocation of authority among Justice and Treasury and the Postal Service not apply to the conspiracy offenses under section 371? Because that's not a violation of this section.",
  "The offense is never completed. there's nothing -- nothing occurs except a conspiracy, and you're telling us a conspiracy is not a violation of this section. This section sets forth the penalty -- that's your argument -- but it does not establish the offense. The offense is established by 371. If that's the case, this allocation of responsibility among the various divisions of the Government doesn't apply to conspiracy prosecutions, which would make no sense at all.",
  "When -- when you say when there are multiple objects, you're not getting the money - - money laundering just under 371. You'd surely charge both under 371 and under -- under -- what is it? 1956.",
  "This is 846.",
  "Was the argument below that - - -- that imposing the sentencing enhancement was unconstitutional, or was the argument just that the facts didn't support it?",
  "That was a case I dissented in, wasn't it?",
  "Well, when you say full enjoyment, you -- you think when -- when I'm taxed on something, I -- I don't have full enjoyment of it? The only thing triggered by age, as far as I can tell -- the only thing triggered by age -- is your obtaining of a tax benefit. That's all. Once you reach a certain age, you can withdraw it without -- without paying the 10 percent tax.",
  "Well, I'm sure it does, but - - but it's -- it's hard to accept the notion that simply because after a certain age I get a tax benefit, I'm receiving the money on account of my age. That doesn't make any sense to me.",
  "Are there any other plans that are -- are entities clearly covered by the statute in which the only effect of age is to enable you to avoid a tax?",
  "All right. Well, then - -",
  "-- then you might persuade me.",
  "Okay.",
  "It -- it might be wrong anyway.",
  "Well, they're taking out loans against it. They're -- they're not withdrawing the money.",
  "Holistic for me. What -- what does it -- what does it modify? I mean, if you had to diagram it, on account of goes to what noun?",
  "No. I thought I was being holistic yesterday, to tell you the truth.",

  "-- but what does on account of modify?",
  "Where -- where is that noun?",
  "The right to receive a payment under a stock bonus, pension - -",

  "It's the right on account of.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's your strong point.",

  "Right.",
  "That's a good argument. I like that.",
  "What your -- what your opponents say is that the -- the thing at the end doesn't prove anything because they're willing to acknowledge that some IRA's can be so structured that you cannot withdraw until -- until you reach a certain age. And if they're structured that way, they would be covered. So you had to mention 408 in the -- in the exceptions. What's wrong with that argument?",
  "Why didn't the Government come in here, just as a matter of curiosity? We don't have an amicus brief here from the Government, do we?",

  "-- that -- that your answer to Justice Breyer as to why that makes a difference with regard to the purpose of the statute is that the purpose of the statute is to make sure that people have money for their retirement, and that if you can withdraw it for any reason whatever, there is no security that that money will be there for their retirement; whereas if you limit the reasons to sickness and -- and a certain other number of emergency reasons, the chances the money will be there for the retirement are much higher.",
  "Isn't that the answer?",
  "All right, but it's acquired. Say -- say retirement, not old age. I mean, you know, 60 -- it's not that bad - -",
  "Ms. -- Ms. Karlan says she doesn't know of any -- of any IRA that did place a -- a restriction which would bring it within that exemption even though the ordinary IRA wouldn't be within the exemption. Do you know of any IRA, a single IRA that - - that has a provision in it restricting withdrawal?",
  "They can, but do -- do you know that there's -- there's one out there? I don't know - -",
  "You didn't just draw one up for this case, did you?",
  "Was that -- was that an IRA that she had? It was an IRA?",
  "Plus 10 percent you say.",
  "So it's just -- just like an IRA.",
  "Let me just get -- get straight what -- what the -- what the universe of plans we have in front of us here. Do you assert that there are no other plans, clearly covered by this statute, that permit withdrawal for any reason but with a penalty?",
  "Would permit withdrawal for any reason whatever provided that a penalty is paid.",
  "None of them is like that.",
  "These -- these other plans that allow you to withdraw for certain reasons but not for any reason -- what happens if you withdraw for any reason?",
  "What is the sanction against - - I mean, you just go in. You withdraw the money for -- for a reason that is not allowed by the employer plan. What -- what is the sanction?",
  "You don't really have a right to receive it on account of age. You have a right to receive it without a penalty on account of age.",
  "It isn't the right to receive the money that depends on your age. It's the right to receive the money without paying a tax.",
  "It is a right that's important, but it's not what the statute says. The statute says - -",
  "-- the right to receive a payment on account of, among other things, age.",
  "No, but it lists the other reasons: on account of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service. And -- and, you know, when you have a list like that, you would think that the right to receive the money for some other reason doesn't -- doesn't qualify. I mean, I would think that that's - -",
  "Or -- or at least -- at least some other reason that isn't closely related to those.",
  "Well, yes. You -- you don't have to make up a hardship. You just say I want the money. Okay, you want the money? Here's the money.",
  "I don't even have to lie about the hardship. I mean --",
  "In any of these other plans, can you get the money so long as you're willing to pay a penalty?",
  "Without any qualification for disability, illness. No. I just want the money. Give me the money and I'll pay you 10 percent. Is there any plan that works like that?",
  "Once it's final under State procedure, right? And you also would add once there's no clerical error. She didn't mistakenly say, you know, affirm when she meant to write deny. Leaving that aside, once it's final under State procedure, it's final.",
  "And sometimes it's wrong.",
  "But it'd be sometimes wrong no matter how you define final. I mean, you know, she let's --",
  "-- let's all the evidence on and -- and does it after all the evidence is there, and then she -- and then at the close of all the evidence, she gives a directed verdict for -- for the defendant, and then discharges the jury, and as soon as the jury walks out, oh, my God, what a mistake I made. Too bad. Right? I mean, we say double jeopardy.",
  "Does the State have the power to say whether -- whether an acquittal under State law constitutes an acquittal for purposes of Federal constitutional double jeopardy purposes? Is that a State law question or a Federal question?",
  "I thought it was.",
  "What if -- what if this had been the sole count, the gun possession count had been the sole count, and -- and the same ruling had been made by the judge? Would you say that there was double jeopardy attaching or not?",
  "And what if it's a bench trial?",
  "I know it's difficult. What's your answer?",
  "It's over.",
  "Wow. It goes all the way up on appeal and the jury -- I -- I don't know what the -- I guess he lets the jury go home for a couple of months or while the appeal is pending and then when the decision is overturned by the court of appeals, he comes back and recommences the trial? Wow.",
  "What is the conceptual basis for saying that jury discharge makes the difference? Why is that the touchstone?",
  "No, but we usually don't use - -",
  "-- we don't use the -- I mean, you could use the Due Process Clause for everything, for double jeopardy, for all of the other protections in the Constitution. I think our cases say if -- if there's a problem that has been created by ignoring the double jeopardy rules, you don't solve that problem by -- by the deus ex machina of the Due Process Clause.",
  "So this a problem created by the judge's dismissal, and which this defendant had every reason to rely upon as being the end of that part of the case. I'm inclined to say if -- if that is a problem, in fairness it's a -- it's a double jeopardy problem, not a due process problem.",
  "And in fact, the -- the quick and dirty procedure you describe is probably a boon to prosecutors because a judge is -- is not likely to take the serious step of dismissing a charge on the basis of - - of such a procedure and is more likely to say, well, we'll let the trial go ahead and see what the evidence discloses. I mean, I can't imagine that this is not a boon to the prosecutor rather than, as you -- as you seem to paint it here, a disadvantage.",
  "This is a very unusual judge I would think to - -",
  "-- to whip it out like that and -- and enter an acquittal without -- without letting it go forward.",
  "You may -- you may regret what you've asked for.",
  "Why -- why shouldn't you have -- what's magic about the jury? Why shouldn't you have the same rule on a bench trial? A judge in a bench trial makes a ruling, thinks about it, and says, you know, I shouldn't have ruled that way. Why shouldn't that judge be able to change? Just because there's no jury to discharge.",
  "What -- what is the line? I mean, is there -- there no point at which he can't change? I mean --",
  "But it's not dismissal of the jury. We'll have to make up some other line. Right?",
  "Honing?",
  "It doesn't -- it doesn't shorten the length that they're going to be incarcerated. There -- there is no certainty that -- that if they win this action, they will be incarcerated for a lesser period, is there?",
  "And -- and there was in the other cases, wasn't there? In Balisok.",
  "Well, but --",
  "Oh, indeed, but the -- but - - but getting the good-time credits entitled them to be - - be released earlier. They might have been released even earlier still, but their entitlement to be released earlier was a consequence, wasn't it?",
  "And there is no entitlement to be released earlier as a consequence of this.",
  "You just get another hearing and maybe you will, maybe you won't.",
  "Well, that's true. So it makes it possible that you'll get released earlier, but -- but there's no assurance you'll -- really, the crucial question for me, I think, is whether -- whether this could have been brought as a habeas action. Could this have been brought as a habeas action?",
  "But they're just asking for a new hearing. They're not asking for an earlier release. What's your closest case that -- that would allow a habeas action which does not seek an earlier release but just - - just a hearing?",
  "No. But it -- No, go on.",
  "Is this with an I or an E?",
  "With an I or an E?",
  "Doesn't the Prison Litigation Reform Act require exhaustion even in a 1983 action?",
  "Are -- are you sure that that's what they have to prove, that -- a durational impact? Wouldn't it be enough to show that they were deprived of an opportunity to have the sentence shorter? Wouldn't - - wouldn't it -- assuming there was an ex post facto violation, wouldn't that be enough of an injury, that they lost an opportunity to have their sentence shortened?",
  "What -- what is --",
  "Which is a new -- a new parole hearing. Isn't -- I mean, it -- I --",
  "Yes. How -- how can it be fixed except by giving him a new parole hearing?",
  "Why isn't he? If -- if -- what he's saying is the past proceedings were invalid, I want you to do it right in the future.",
  "No. It -- it isn't mooted because he still got it done wrong. The second hearing was still wrong.",
  "His claims here -- if his claims here are correct.",
  "You -- you say we don't know whether the -- the new parole hearing he got was still invalid?",
  "Oh, so we can assume that that was valid. You're -- you're willing to assume that for purposes of this case?",
  "Do we have any case in which what was being -- what was sought to be challenged in a habeas action was not the duration of the sentence, but the procedure by which the duration of the sentence was determined?",
  "Is there any -- why -- why shouldn't that be a habeas action? Why shouldn't 1983 be limited to prison conditions, which is what we've always -- and referred to it as -- as that in the past?",
  "No, no, no, not necessarily. He -- he's just saying the parole hearing I got lacked due process safeguards. Had I had those safeguards, I might -- I might -- have been given a shorter sentence. I can't prove I would have. I'm not challenging the sentence really, but I want a new hearing. I didn't get due process. Give me a proper hearing because I might get out earlier. Why shouldn't that come under habeas?",
  "Yes, well, those cases happen to involve -- happen to involve sentences. This case doesn't involve a sentence. It involves an opportunity to have his sentence shortened. And if habeas can be brought for that, we would phrase it differently. We wouldn't say it would have to invalidate the sentence. We would say it would have to invalidate the proceeding that could have shortened his sentence. I grant you we can't use the same language we did in the earlier cases, but if this is properly a habeas action, then we -- we can get some language to make it fit.",
  "I think sentence means custody. Don't you think it means custody?",
  "The custody you've been sentenced to?",
  "Mr. Waxman, we really have to examine your -- you know, your allegations, I suppose, one at a time. It makes it a very complicated case. The -- the State's response to -- to your argument that two of -- of the State's attorneys involved in this case had been found to have made racially based strikes in the past -- the State's response to that is that that was not part of the evidence presented in State court, and therefore, it -- it is not a proper consideration in reviewing the State court decision. What -- what is your response to that?",
  "Was it brought to the attention of the court?",
  "Oh, my. You mean anything out there that -- that a court could take judicial notice of can be -- can be charged to the court? My goodness, no. I think it was the burden of the -- of the defendant challenging the -- the strikes to bring -- bring that to the attention of the court. My goodness.",
  "I mean, that's the problem. We've got to go through each one of them one by one.",
  "And -- and I'm -- you know, I don't remember the names of people involved in -- in prior cases in this Court. I -- I -- you know, if we said - -",
  "-- you had this same officer before you, my goodness, I -- I wouldn't remember it.",
  "Their response - -",
  "The respondent's reply to this -- this minimal punishment argument is that in fact the - - the two white prospective jurors who had -- who had expressed antagonism towards the death penalty were subjected to the same questioning, and that the seven out of eight black prospective jurors were seven who had expressed antagonism to the death penalty. Now, is that not true?",
  "Well, we have to go through each one of them and see if the degree of hostility expressed by the white jurors was the same as the degree of hostility expressed by the black jurors. And in fact, the degree of hostility by the black jurors was quite high.",
  "One said I really don't believe in it. I support it only in extreme cases, such as those involving mass killings or mutilation. And another one - - another one said, well, right now maybe I do, but who knows later?",
  "Now, if -- if there happens to be a different attitude towards the death penalty among the black jurors than there is among the white jurors, you cannot fault the -- the attorneys for -- for striking more of the black jurors.",
  "Well, now, wait. He also said -- when asked whether he could vote to impose the death penalty, he said, right now I say I can, but tomorrow I might not.",
  "Do you think that's a strong - -",
  "We have to deal with each of the six one by one, and -- and they have arguments with respect to each of them. I don't care what Rand said. Those things that you said sounded very good. But if he finishes it off by saying, right now I say that, but tomorrow I might not - -",

  "We only speak to the issues before us, don't we? And the issue before us last time was not the issue before us here. It was simply whether there was enough evidence to require the issuance of a COA. Isn't that right?",
  "And that's a good deal different. Whatever the majority might have said about other issues, it certainly was not binding on the court of appeals, was it?",
  "You're saying that that is not what happened here.",
  "It was on the basis of the questionnaires expressing hostility to the death penalty that more intensive questioning was given to some people than to others, and that the mere fact that a larger number of those people was black is not a violation.",
  "So the hypothetical, assuming that you -- you just have blacks and whites with no difference in -- in what they -- in what they had said on the questionnaire, is a hypothetical that you say does not exist in this case.",

  "-- the case didn't involve it?",

  "That's what I'm interested in. You win, either way. If it -- maybe if the Commerce Clause -- dormant Commerce Clause discrimination principle applies, you win, if we scrutinize strictly and say you have a good justification. Whether you do or not, I guess I'll find out from reading the record, but I'm more interested in the first half, which is -- doesn't apply at all. Now, your opponent said, in response to my pointing to Brandeis on this, that to support you, as to precedent, Bacchus. Young's Market isn't any good anymore. As to concept, you can divide the dormant Commerce Clause into a -- you have to favor out-of-state principle, which was the original package doctrine, which has long since disappeared, and the anti-discrimination principle, which hasn't disappeared. And her third part, implicit, is, historically, this whole Section 2 was aimed at the original package part; there is not a word in any brief I saw that suggests any motive in Section 2 to get rid of the anti-discrimination principle. I haven't found a word in support on your side on that. So she says, \"Put those three things together, and we win.\" That's her point. Now, what's your response?",
  "No, no, don't -­",
  "-- don't put in the qualifications.",
  "How can that be? I mean, if this is a constitutional elimination of the Commerce Clause, how can Congress bring it back in simply by enacting a statute?",
  "But you -- you want us to read it by its terms. It doesn't say anything about the dormant Commerce Clause. If we read it absolutely the way one of your arguments wants us to do, surely it excludes Congress.",
  "So you don't want us to read it absolutely.",
  "Well, but that's fine. And the other side isn't denying that here, that if, you know, they're -- discrimination means treating out-of-state people differently without good reason.",

  "Well, they could -- they could use them, but just say, instead of filing a report, he'll consult with the -- with the deciding judge.",
  "Well, they confer with each other. Maybe, maybe.",
  "Well, now, wait. Under the Due Process Clause, I assume you would be asking for more than just access to the report.

  "Well, that -- that would mean that -- that you would have to make public the -- the reports of a regular Tax Court judge in cases that then go on to the full court. And that's not done, is it?",
  "Well, but it doesn't matter. It would still be a report of the Tax Court if you don't take that language literally. If you say any report coming out of the institution is a report of the Tax Court, you would have to make public the reports of the individual Tax Court judges, which is not done.",

Surely one -- one can readily regard general research activities relating to fisheries or wildlife to be part of the activity of conserving and protecting fisheries and wildlife.",

I -- I mean, if you didn't believe that, if -- if you believed that what Totten says is we have no jurisdiction, then we'd have no problem and we could resolve all of the questions. But it seems to me if you believe that Totten is based mainly -- you know, it's a contract case and said the contract is just totally invalid, we shouldn't be reaching the contract issue. We should simply say that if -- if we agree with you, that there's no substantive due process claim here and -- and no claim based on the regulations.

And since, the argument goes, the -- the only purpose of Totten was to preserve the secrets, why can't we preserve the secrets that way?

  "Why not? Why not? Why not? I mean, is every decision we make up for review when the interested parties fail to cite the, what they now assert are the dispositive acts?",
  "But there wouldn't have been a violation of federal law if this were not Indian country, if this were not an Oneida reservation when the transfer occurred.",
  "Is that the application of the Nonintercourse Act? I assume it applied only to federal act reservations.",
  "How does it read? What does it say?",
  "What goes with the taxes? You've said that the other effect will be that whenever the Oneidas buy a piece of property that is within this former reservation, and of which only 1 percent is now owned by Indians, whenever they buy a piece of property, that property is taken off the tax rolls.",
  "Which, of course, makes it a lot easier for them to buy it because it's much less expensive for them to hold that land. What else happens? The - -",
  "The town can't regulate.",
  "You're a good lawyer that they hired, and the Oneidas may not have had as good a lawyer. I don't think this was done around the campfire, do you?",
  "It isn't the FBI that keeps peace on other reservations, is it? Isn't it quite standard for state law enforcement to function?",
  "Can he answer that?",
  "Sure it can. I mean, one way to pursue that policy is to offer them lands in the west if they want to go there. That would certainly pursue the Government's policy of removing them.",
  "So you're saying there is no consideration. If, they simply agree to remove if they -- if they want to remove.",
  "No, they gave none, I'm talking about.",
  "The Indians. You're saying they gave no promise in exchange, if they simply promised to remove if they felt like it.",
  "I'm trying to help you here.",
  "So you're saying your position was and is that it's not inalienable without the approval of the feds?",
  "But it, the portion within the reservation you claim is alienable so long as it's not owned by an Oneida. The current owners can sell it to somebody else, right?",
  "Yes or -- Does that strike you as strange?",
  "Mr. Smith, isn't there any principle of laches that comes into effect here? I mean, really what you're asking the Court to do is to sanction a very odd checkerboard system of jurisdiction in the middle of New York State. Some parcels, the ones the Indians choose to buy and are able to buy, become Indian territory and everything else is governed by New York State. This is just a terrible situation as far as governance is concerned and part of the blame for the situation we're in is that the Oneidas did not complain about this for 170 years.",
  "The case also held that because of the passage of time and the reliance interests that have developed, we are not going to give you possession. Now, why doesn't the same principle apply to giving you jurisdiction? Because of the passage of time, you can get damages for trespass. Maybe even you can get the value of the land. But it would just create a chaotic situation if we say that you have jurisdiction in the middle of New York State over any pieces of land that you can buy.",
  "That's not the end of it. From what you're saying, I gather that you believe, in that case, once they purchase the land, it becomes tribal.",
  "Mr. Stewart, your time is beginning to come up, and there is one thing we haven't talked about that I would really like to get your view on, and that is the 1788 Treaty -- what was that, Fort Schuyler -- Treaty of Fort Schuyler?",
  "-- between New York State and the Oneidas. Now, that contained language which said the Oneidas cede and grant all their lands to the people of the State of New York. That was the operative provision. Later on, it - - Article 2 says, \"Of the ceded lands\" -- the ceded lands, lands that have been ceded -- \"a tract described by metes and bounds is reserved to the Oneidas to hold to themselves and their posterity forever.\" Now, I would normally interpret that to mean that the Oneidas gave up all of their sovereignty over the lands and were given back, by the State of New York, the right over this tract designated by metes and bounds. Now, I'm saying I would normally interpret that, except in a treaty with the Indians. In a treaty with the Indians, you say, \"Well\" -- and we have cases which have language somewhat like this, and they say, \"Well, they really didn't cede the part that they reserved.\" That may be the case in -- ordinarily. But it seems to me, a basic principle of contract law -- of treaty law, of any law -- that where there is an ambiguous phrase or provision, you interpret it the way the parties themselves have interpreted it. And it seems to me that the subsequent history, after 1788, indicates that the Oneidas believed that New York State had jurisdiction over that land.",
  "The New York State police were in there. New York State managed the lands.",
  "I don't -- I don't understand that argument at all. I mean, it's just a general rule that, where you've been wronged, you have to come forward, in a timely fashion, to get the wrong righted. And what difference does it make what the nature of the wrong is, whether it's dispossession or not?",
  "Well, it isn't just taxes we're talking about. It's jurisdiction over these parcels of land. It -- I mean, taxes -- that's just one aspect of saying that this land no longer belongs to New York State.",
  "Well, did it rest upon the cession in Wisconsin?",
  "I think that's unquestionable. The -- the issue really is whether it's an abuse of that discretion to -- to grant a stay and abeyance when the -­ the petitioner comes before the court for habeas without having exhausted in State court. I mean, that's the question. I think everybody will stipulate that there's power to -- to stay proceedings, but is it an abuse of discretion to do so in these circumstances given the statute that -- that wants a 1-year, prompt resort to the Federal courts.",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, but it's a free ride if you say -- so long as you get in within the 1-year period, the court can then give you another 3 years or as long as the court thinks is reasonable for you to go back and -­ and do what you were supposed to do before you arrived. I mean, that seems to me is a frustration of the 1-year statute of limitations.",
  "It's fair for you to say he loses his right to Federal review -­",
  "-- because we wouldn't necessarily take that case, whereas you say he'd have a right to go into Federal -- Federal habeas. So -­",
  "That -- that happens often with time limits. I mean, it depends on when the court finishes its job and so forth. What do you do about -- about our opinion in -­ in Duncan v. Walker where we refused to toll the limitation period during the pendency of a -- of the Federal proceeding and -- and said, in -- in justification of that holding, by tolling the limitation period for the pursuit of State remedies and not during the pendency of applications for Federal review, 2244 provides a powerful incentive for litigants to exhaust all available State remedies before proceeding in the lower Federal courts? You are now urging us to eliminate that incentive entirely.",
  "Why not?",
  "Sometimes -­",
  "Well, you said -- you said in your brief that -- that it's always in the -- with the possible exception of capital cases, it's always in the interest of a habeas applicant to get -- get it decided as soon as possible. That's not really true. Sometimes it's -- it's in his interest to delay it as much as possible. Witnesses will die. People will move away. All sorts of -- there are all sorts of reasons why he -- he might want to delay the process.",
  "But you -- you don't really think we can hold that line, giving less favorable treatment to somebody who's -- who's trying to argue against a capital penalty, less favorable treatment to him than somebody who's -- who just wants to avoid 10 years in jail? That's just not going to work.",
  "How -- how general is -- is this problem? And -- and to what extent is it tied to the fact that you can bring a second habeas in South Dakota? I mean, in -- in most States, if this had happened, I presume, when you went back to the State court, the State court would say, you know, you didn't -- you didn't put in these claims the last time around and they're procedurally barred. Isn't that what would happen in -- in most other States?",
  "Yes.",
  "Unless what would happen in these other States as the -- is that the court would grant the -- the stay of proceedings in order to let him go back to the State court and be told after however long it takes that -- that his -- his claims are now procedurally barred. Do you think the Federal court would simply make its own determination that the claims would be rejected by the State court and therefore it would not stay? I don't know.",
  "I'm not sure -- I'm not sure it's -- it's true, are you, that -- that the reason people get into these situations is because they were pro se. That wasn't the case here. I -- I think they probably get into this situation very often because they have a better or at least a different lawyer at the Federal habeas stage than they had at the State habeas stage, and this new lawyer sees additional claims that -- that he wants to make. Isn't -- isn't that exactly what happened here?",
  "You know, it -- it could be, I suppose, that these people have nothing else to do sitting around in the jailhouse, and -- and having written their State petition, they sit around for a few more months and they say, you know, there are a few more claims I could make. I think that's -- it's as simply as that. And -- and what the statute is designed to do, I -- I think you're telling us, is to say, look it, be careful. Make all your claims in the State court the first time. That doesn't seem to me to be too much to demand.",
  "Even without going back to the State court, I don't see anything in this statute which indicates that Congress expected everybody who comes into Federal court with unexhausted claims to have time to remedy that defect by running back to State court and -­ and filing. This statute doesn't give any such indication. And it's clear that will never happen if he files on the 364th day after the conclusion of the State proceedings. Right? I mean, his year is up already. Even if the judge decides the question the next morning, it's too late. So I -- I don't know why we have to be concerned about giving him some entitled second chance to go back to -- to State court. I don't see anything in the statute that -- that guarantees or that even envisions that. And",
  "General Long, do -- do those States that apply stay and abey make a distinction between whether the person who comes with unexhausted claims has exhausted some claims in State court and ones who haven't?",
  "Why should that be?",
  "If you get a second bite, why shouldn't you get a first bite? I mean, I -- I don't see -- I don't see any reason for treating preferentially the -- the person who files in State court but does not file new claims, which he should have known to file at that time, and treating the person who comes to the Federal court with those new claims but doesn't have -- doesn't have even one that he took to State court. I -- I don't see any reason to be merciful to one and not the other.",
  "But you're -- but you're telling me the States do draw a distinction.",
  "I mean -- I mean -­",
  "Rococo I think.",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Lange, why -- why isn't -- gee, you have Lange and Long. Why isn't Attorney General Long's assertion sensible? That is to say, it's an extraordinary thing to have Federal district courts in all criminal cases reviewing the work of State supreme courts. We -- we got into this in an era when we couldn't trust State supreme courts, especially in racial cases. But that's where we are now. But why is it unreasonable to say, look, you get one shot at coming to Federal court? And if -- if you -­ if you bungle that and you haven't exhausted first, we're not denying your claims. Go back to State court. We're just not going to reintervene as Federal courts. Your -­ your claims are not dead. Justice is not denied. You just have to go back through the State system and we're not going to blue pencil the work of the State system a second time. That's all. Why isn't that reasonable?",
  "Well, doesn't it depend on -­ on what you -- what you consider to be the value of the stock. Until the disclosure of the fact that they didn't find gold is made, the stock is still worth $60, isn't it?",
  "Because everybody else thinks they found gold too. So you're still holding stock worth $60, if worth means its market value. Right?",
  "And we're dealing with a special rule that looks to market value. Right? You don't have to have the -- the representation made explicitly to the plaintiff. It's a representation that was made to the market at large which caused the market value of the stock. Right?",
  "So he paid $60, he got $60. There's no loss.",
  "It doesn't matter in this case, does it? Is -- is that issue before us?",
  "Do we have to decide that issue here?",
  "And is it -- is it easy to prove that -- that the price of this now valuable stock because they found platinum would have been $40 higher had they found gold? I mean, the burden would be on the plaintiff to prove that -- would -- I mean, if we adopted that theory.",
  "It would be very hard to prove, it seems to me.",
  "I think they'd be called reliance damages. You know, I used to teach contract law. We would call it reliance damages.",
  "Well, they -- they wouldn't have to prove how it came out. They would just have to prove that the market knew the truth, no matter how the market learned the truth. I mean, if it was published in a -- in a column by some market reporter who doesn't disclose how he found out. So long as the market knows the truth, isn't that all they need?",
  "In any event, the difference between getting the -- the complaint dismissed on the pleadings or having to wait for a -- a 12(b)(6) motion because as soon as you, you know, ask for the -- the proof of the elements of the cause of action, you're entitled to have, if -- if your analysis of the case is correct, you're entitled to have the drop in -- in the value of the stock shown.",
  "But they paid -- they paid whether it was a market price or not. I mean -­",
  "Well, what they paid happens to be the market price, but -- but you can't really say that the Ninth Circuit was referring to the market price as part of its -- its damages. Its damages are what they paid. Whether that -- if they paid above market, it would be the same.",
  "Why? I don't understand. I mean, there would be even more expectation taken out after the fraud is announced. I mean, it's just like saying, you know, besides -- besides fact that our CEO just died, there's no gold there. Don't you think it would go down still further?",
  "How can you reconcile that with your concession that if the person who -- who buys it at an inflated price turns around 2 days later and sells it at that same inflated price, he cannot bring suit? You would not allow recovery in that situation.",
  "How -- how can you reconcile that -­",
  "-- with the notion that the loss occurred at the time your purchased?",
  "They're saying there's no losses. I mean, that's -- it's inconsistent how the losses come out. You just told us the loss occurs, bang, when you buy it. You've gotten stock that really isn't worth what you paid for it, the notion of -- of worth as some -- you know, some objective thing rather than what -­ what people are willing to pay.",
  "But that's your theory and it seems to me you're stuck with it. And if that theory is true, then it shouldn't matter that you later sell it to some other poor, unsuspecting individual for the same amount you bought it for.",

  "That's what they're saying.",
  "To me your -- your -­",

  "It cited -- I thought cited Knapp and -- which, in turn, cited Gray or -- or --",
  "I mean, if you're worried about it, why aren't you worried about it later, as well as earlier?

Then let's get rid of this -- rid of the case earlier.",
  "I don't -- I don't know why -­ why it's desirable not to include that at the pleading stage.",
  "So -- so -- I'm not sure I understand what -- I'm -- I'm really coming to believe that this is a misunderstanding. It seems to me you're now saying that the loss does not occur when you make the purchase. It is just that that is the limit on your loss, the difference between what the stock would have cost you had the -- the absence of gold been known and what you actually paid.",
  "But that is not your loss. You're saying now the loss has to occur later when the price goes down and you're thereby harmed. Is that it?",
  "You don't know about it, but the market knows about it. That's -- that's why the stock has gone down.",
  "How -- how could one not discover the vacatur? Here's my problem. I -- I frankly don't think the text of -- of (4), part (4), really fits comfortably with either your interpretation or the Government's. It says the date on which the facts supporting the claim could have been discovered through the exercise of diligence. Well, as you point out in your brief, the fact supporting the claim here is simply the elimination of the prior conviction, the vacatur of the prior conviction. That's the fact supporting the claim, not the facts which led to the vacatur, but it's the vacatur. So that makes the Government's case a little uncomfortable. But it seems to me you have to acknowledge that your case is pretty uncomfortable when you -- when you talk about discovering the fact of the -- of the vacatur. I mean, it's a matter of public record. How does one discover a -- a public record? How -- how could you need due diligence to discover a public record? I mean, it seems to me it's -- it's automatically -- isn't the vacatur always served on the -- on the person whose conviction is vacated? Isn't it always that person who seeks the vacation? So what sense does it make to talk about his discovering that particular fact? It seems to me it makes no sense. So you're left with -- with two competing interpretations, both of which have some textual problems. I'm inclined to think you take the one that makes sense, given the purpose of the statute, and the purpose of the statute, as Justice O'Connor has suggested, is to make people bring up their claims promptly. And -- and that purpose would -- would be served by the Government's rule and not by yours. You say unless the State has some statute of limitation, this -- this Federal requirement of due diligence goes begging. What's -- what's your response to that? You really think -- especially about the discover.",
  "I was going to say that. What -- what -- excuse me.",
  "But that's -- go on.",
  "That's true.",
  "Well, that may be but that also may be what it says. I -- I don't follow your interpretation of what is the meaning of facts supporting the claim or claims. I mean, once you say that the facts supporting the claim is the vacatur of the -- of the State conviction, I mean, it seems that's the end of it.",
  "And -- and as for due diligence, yes, it doesn't seem to make much sense in that context, but as pointed out by your friend on the other side, it makes sense in all other contexts and -- and you don't expect the language to be applicable all the time. So what's wrong with that?",
  "It may well be, but that's how they wrote it. I'm talking about the word facts.",
  "How can this be a fact supporting the -- you -- you want us to say a fact supporting the conviction includes the facts that lead up to the facts supporting the conviction or -- or supporting the claim.",
  "But you're still asking us -- I mean, even -- even in your fall-back position -- your -­ your principal position asks us to -- to play games with the -- with the word facts, and your fall-back position asks us to play games with the word discovered. You want us to read discovered to mean either discovered or obtained, which discovered just doesn't mean obtained. It just doesn't.",
  "That -- that seems to me an -­ an extraordinary non sequitur. I don't understand. They didn't want to deal with it because they thought he was innocent. I -- how does that make any sense?",
  "What she testified to makes no sense.",
  "Well, the -- the portions of his life history that -- that are the most appealing are the portions from his youth, before he went into the -­ into the juvenile institutions, and they were certainly with him during that period.",
  "Let me -- let me take you back to the -- to the experts. You say he did not specifically ask the experts to go -- to go into his childhood problems. You know, I can imagine when the expert comes on the stand, the first question being asked is, now, Mr. Expert, were you told by counsel to look into the childhood problems? You know, as though counsel were planting in the expert's mind what the expert should say. What would anyone who hires a psychologist or a psychiatrist -- what would anyone expect him to look into in -- in determining whether the person is -- is mentally injured but -- but the childhood? Do you really think counsel could not have expected with total assurance that these people would do that?",
  "I thought what you just quoted said that they -- that they would intend it to be used in the mitigating phase.",
  "Doesn't -- doesn't all that bear upon mental infirmity at the time of the offense? Isn't the reason that -- that one considers these factors mitigating is that they reduce the guilt at the time of the offense? I -- I thought that that's the whole -­",
  "We -- we just let him off because we're -- we're sympathetic to his present state? I thought that mitigation means that it reduces the guilt of the offense at the time that he commits it.",
  "You -- you want us to adopt a constitutional rule that at least in Pennsylvania counsel have to consult these -- these records -­",
  "-- as a constitutional matter.",
  "So your -- your answer is yes.",
  "You want a constitutional rule that in Pennsylvania counsel must look into these records.",
  "For what purpose did the prosecution use the files?",
  "Use them for -- he did use them for aggravation.",
  "In -- in what respect?",
  "Can you imagine any capital case, if we accept that argument, in which future dangerousness is not at issue? Because whenever you show the depravity of the defendant, what a horrible crime it was, you're going to be able to make the same argument. Any jury is going to be frightened of this man and think he's going to be dangerous in the future. If that's all -- if that's all that Simmons means, we should just say in all capital cases, you assume that it's at issue.",
  "And that seems to be not what we've said.",
  "But -- but that -­",
  "-- that goes -- I -- I would make that argument to show how -- how horrible this crime was. He killed this person specifically in order to prevent testimony, which makes the -- the crime worse. I don't think it necessarily goes to future dangerousness any more than any of the element -- other elements of depravity or -- or the horribleness of the crime goes -­ goes to future dangerousness.",
  "And -- and you -- you expect us in all future cases to read the prosecution's argument and -- and say, well, has it gone over the line from just his depravity into he's future -- you know, he's going to be dangerous in the future?",
  "I think that puts too much of a burden on -- on the Federal courts.",
  "How about justice? I mean, is that the only alternative to vengeance, is -- is future dangerousness? I don't think so at all.",
  "Ms. Zapp, I guess -- I guess I'm confused about your case. I had thought that you were not arguing that Simmons requires a talismanic word or even that it requires much more than existed here. I thought what you were arguing is simply that Simmons could at that time have been interpreted that way.",
  "So you're not -- you're not making the argument.",
  "But you're saying the argument could have been made at -- at the time of this trial -­",
  "-- and before our later jurisprudence.",
  "You're saying it has to be argued.",
  "Not -- not just intimated, not just suggested, but the jury -- you have to argue that this person --",
  "-- is dangerous in the future.",
  "That's a reasonable interpretation of it I would think.",
  "And that explains why your State is the only holdout.",
  "Could -- could I find out what she said came late? I -- I didn't understand. You said -­",
  "-- it came -- what came relatively late?",
  "Came up late.",
  "Only? Only? Only?",
  "I think it's uncontested that all three looked into that, but the point that has been made is that the last two went beyond that. Do you disagree with that?",
  "Excuse me. Where -- where are you getting the term, appropriate relief, from?",
  "All right. But that's -- that's not in the -- that's not in the text of this statute, is it?",
  "And -- and 1983 is not subject to that limitation.",
  "But are they only immune from damages action or are they immune from suit?",
  "So, I mean, that proves too much because they -- the statute obviously intends to eliminate that immunity. The immunity from suit is -- is clearly -­",
  "Well, it allows suit against either municipalities or States, State or local governments. Right?",
  "And the States have immunity not just from damages but from suit.",
  "Unless they have chosen to waive it, which -­",
  "-- one must assume in this area they haven't.",
  "So you have to regard this provision as intentionally overriding some provisions of State law in -- inasmuch as they apply to -- to immunity.",
  "No. That's -­",
  "In for a penny, in for a pound.",
  "If they've -- if they've waived -­",
  "If -- if you acknowledge that it was intended to affect their immunity from suit, why -­ why would we suspect that it was not intended to affect their immunity from damages?",
  "Does this action have to be brought in Federal court? It says any court of competent jurisdiction. Could -­",
  "Attorney's fees are never appropriate, in other words.",
  "What about damages?",
  "Well, this is really a more general proposition you're urging upon us then, that whenever Congress creates a cause of action that is -­ what -- in any respect more limited than section 1983, the background action of section 1983 is not available.",
  "Well, there -- there are two situations. I mean, one can supplement without frustrating. I mean, you -- you could say that in, you know -- in some respects the 1983 will contradict the action that was provided, but one can conceive of a provided action that -- that grants relief which 1983 would not grant.",
  "What -- what about damages? Do -- do you take any position on whether the Communications Act provision enables damages to be collected?",
  "You think it's unnecessary to decide this case.",
  "They -- they don't necessarily disagree. The Government just says the -- the issue doesn't have to be reached in this case.",
  "Mr. Waxman.",
  "Mr. Waxman, how do you -- how do you get a reading of the 30-day limitation, which is applicable to the cause of action under the Communications Act, sucked into the cause of action under section 1983? I mean, if the suit is under 1983, it's under 1983. There's no 30-day limit there.",
  "No, it doesn't.",
  "It doesn't require you to -- to establish a cause of action under some other statute either.",
  "It does not at all. It's -- it's self-contained. And do you know any case where we have read into, or indeed, it's even been urged upon us to read into, section 1983 limitations that somehow come from the statute that was violated and which forms the basis for the 1983 action?",
  "They -- they didn't provide for the normal administrative review because they were quite aware that under the State zoning systems, there would always be State administrative review before the issue even comes up.",
  "And so what this provides is what kind of judicial review there will be after the anticipated administrative review before the zoning board and whatever appeal from the zoning board exists.",
  "Final. Final action or failure to act is what -­",
  "Final action or failure to.",
  "You haven't been injured until you've exhausted your --",
  "You -- you really think that when there is a State provision available for review of the zoning board, you can commence an action under 1983 without even going through the administrative appeals?",
  "This is really respecting the States, which is what the -- the purpose of this -- of this whole provision was.",
  "Well, cable -- cable media companies may -- may have Congress' ear more readily than -- than -- you know, than the municipality of whatever this is or any -­",
  "But I -- I wouldn't put a lot of money on it.",
  "I can't imagine -- I can't imagine, Mr. Waxman, that Congress wanted to impose damages plus attorney's fees upon municipalities without even giving the municipalities the chance to correct their mistakes, which is what you're saying.",
  "You're saying the municipalities' appeal system, which is there for people to take advantage of, is just washed out. One mistake at the lowest level and you get damages and you get attorney's fees. That -- that is extraordinary.",
  "If they're turned in earlier, will they -- will they be ruled on earlier?",
  "Mr. Poe, I -- I -- here I am.",
  "I suppose that if -- if I were the party chairman of the Republican or Democratic Party, I'm -- I might have defended your -- your State system if I had been named as a party, but if I were not named as a party, I'm not sure that I wouldn't -- I wouldn't decline to come in as an amicus, even though I'm interested in the outcome simply because I don't want to alienate my Republican members by depriving them of the freedom, if they want to do it, to go vote. You know, it makes you look sort of parsimonious, doesn't it, when you tell your Republican members, I don't want you to vote in the Libertarian primaries? I -- I don't think we can say that it doesn't hurt the Republican Party or the -- or the Democratic Party simply because they hadn't filed an amicus brief.",
  "They are, after all, politicians, aren't they?",
  "Mr. Poe, I -- I -- why do you rely only upon the damage to the Republican and Democratic Parties? I frankly don't care much about that, but I might care a whole lot about damage to -- to Oklahoma's system of election. Why do you allow party designations? I suppose it is because you want people to know that there are candidates who are associated with particular political views. And to allow a party to, in effect, come in and say, we don't have any particular political views, we -­ we just want to nominate, you know, whoever the most people want to nominate, that just destroys the whole purpose of -- of your system of allowing people to run under a party label. What's the use of a party label?",
  "It -- if it's running as a party, it should run somebody who -- who shares the views of the people in that party, which is somebody who is nominated by -- by the people in that party, or at least those people, joined by others who are not affiliated with another party. That seems to me to make a lot of sense. And it seems to me to destroy that system if -­ if you say, hey, we're -- you know, we -- we're going to allow the Libertarian Party to say, you know, we don't have any real views. We're just going to -- we want to nominate somebody that most people like. So let the Republicans come in, the Democrats come in. The only thing we want is to win. We don't really care.",
  "The -- the State -- the State of Oklahoma doesn't want your party raided. And -- and you say we don't care if we're raided. Come raid us. All we want to do is win. It seems to me it -- it -- you cannot apply the -- the maxim, volenti non fit injuria. Oklahoma is saying to your party, you can't welcome raiding. We don't want your party to be raided whether you like it or not because that's what a party system is. We've set up these elections that -- that have party primaries and party systems on the assumption that each party is going to have a certain -- a certain belief, a certain philosophy, and to allow your candidate to be elected by everybody simply destroys that system. Why is that -- why is that so unreasonable that it's unconstitutional?",
  "Weren't those -­",
  "-- weren't those who would like to nominate the Libertarian candidate who would attract the most people from the other large party? Right?",
  "No, but -- but the candidate mostly to attract people from one of the major parties is the candidate that is -- is more likely to water down the pure Libertarian message and be closer to the message of the Democratic Party or the Republican Party. And -­ and -­",
  "-- people who come into your primary may want to elect such a candidate so that the Libertarian Party will be strengthened and draw votes away from the other majority -­",
  "What facts? We -- we have to evaluate it on the basis of each election? What is a State legislator supposed to do when he votes for a -- an election system? He's going to flip a coin trying to figure out what the fact situation will be when this -­ when this system finally gets before a court? Surely that -- that can't be the test.",
  "That's the same as election system -- that's the same as Alaska's system. Right? I mean, it boils down to the same thing. It boils down to an open primary, doesn't it?",
  "The last category could -­ could register as independents. I mean, if they're ashamed of -- of the L word, they -- they could just register as independents. Right?",
  "What did -- what did you seek in this action? What did you seek in this action? Did -­ did you seek just more time to -- to register? I -- I thought you -- you sought to overturn the -- the system entirely and -- I mean, maybe you asked for too much.",
  "So more -- more time might be -- might be a good idea, but that wouldn't satisfy your -­ your complaint here.",
  "Your -- your complaint is no matter how much time you're given -­",
  "What are the mici States? You said this a couple -- what are mici States? Mici States did you say?",
  "Oh, the -­",
  "Okay. I thought you were saying mici.",
  "You don't concede, or do you, that elevating the city from a depressed to prosperous is a better justification than elevating a city from prosperous to more prosperous?",
  "Mr. Bullock, do you equate purpose with use? Are the two terms the same? Does the public use requirement mean nothing more than that it have a public purpose?",
  "That's your answer to Justice Souter.",
  "Isn't that approaching -- Isn't that in effect changing the test from public use to efficient public use? I mean, what's -- you know, if I condemn land for a public utility and the public utility turns out to be very inefficient, has the condemnation been invalid?",
  "Do you want us to sit here and evaluate the prospects of each condemnation one by one?",
  "Mr. Horton, what, what difference does it make that, that New London was in an economic depression? Would it not be fully as much, under your theory of a public use, for a city to say, yes, we are not doing badly, but we could do better. Let's attract some high-tech industry here. You can't possibly draw a line between depressed cities and undepressed cities, can you?",
  "You wouldn't. And you wouldn't ask us to do it either.",
  "Any city can do it. And in the hypothetical that Justice Souter gave earlier where, you know, you couldn't take it from A and give it to B, because B is a good Democrat, you could take it from A and give it to B if B is richer, and would pay higher municipal taxes, couldn't you?",
  "No. I just want to take property from people who are paying less taxes and give it to people who are paying more taxes. That would be a public use, wouldn't it?",
  "Let me qualify it. You can take from A to give to B if B pays more taxes?",
  "I'll accept that. You can take from A and give to B if B pays significantly more taxes.",
  "You accept that as a proposition?",
  "Is that a factual finding? You consider that a factual finding?",
  "Well, that this is primarily for the benefit of the city of New London, not for the benefit of a - -",
  "In the eye of the beholder, to whom do you think this does greater benefit to, not a factual finding.",
  "Mr. Horton, you're paying for it, but you're also taking property from somebody who doesn't want to sell it. Does that count for nothing? Yes, you're paying for it, but you're giving the money to somebody who doesn't want the money, who wants to live in the house that she's lived in her whole life. That counts for nothing?",
  "Well, then, let me ask - - would, would the reasonableness standard, if the project is indeed reasonable, and there is genuine prospect that all of these good things that you're talking about will happen, why wouldn't private money come in to further the project? Why is it necessary to condemn it if it's so reasonable. Why couldn't you, you -- now, you say there is a holdout for one part, parcel. Couldn't the city fund a private purchase of that parcel? Say, you know, we'll make funds available out of our general tax revenue to somebody who wants to come in and put together this system? Of course, that person has to buy out property owners, but we'll, we'll give you money to buy them out at high prices.",
  "Common carriers are subject to state regulation to a degree that private companies are not. They must, they must treat all comers alike. I mean, I don't think the public utility cases are at all comparable to condemning land in order to get a new company to move in and pay more taxes. I just don't think it's similar.",
  "And that would really overrule a bunch of prior cases and really throw condemnation law into chaos.",
  "You didn't misspeak. But you know, in any case - -",
  "What this lady wants is not more money. No amount of money is going to satisfy her. She is living in this house, you know, her whole life and she does not want to move. She said I'll move if it's being taken for a public use, but by God, you're just giving it to some other private individual because that individual is going to pay more taxes. I -- it seems to me that's, that's an objection in principle, and an objection in principle that the public use requirement of the Constitution seems to be addressed to.",
  "It wouldn't the first of Holmes' decisions to be overruled.",
  "Mr. Horton, I'm not proposing that the state has to use the property itself. I'm simply proposing that its use not be a private use which has incidental benefits to the state. That is not enough to justify use of the condemnation power.",
  "You can give it to a private entity, you can give it to a railroad, to some public utility. But the use that it's put to by that railroad and public utility is a public use. That's why it's a public utility. It's quite different to say you can give it to a private individual simply because that private individual is going to hire more people and pay more taxes. That, it seems to me, just washes out entirely the distinction between private use and public use.",
  "Well, we've said it a lot, though, haven't we? Why do we keep on saying it?",
  "Why would you feel --",
  "Why would you feel better about our doing that in order to determine whether -- whether there's a public use than you would feel our doing it in order to decide whether there's been a taking?",
  "I mean, wouldn't all of your -- all of your objections apply equally?",
  "You're -- you're not really urging us to -- to defer the -- the evil day and simply say, well, this test, which is more than rational basis, may well apply to -- to whether there's been a -- a public use or not, but it certainly doesn't apply to whether there's been a taking.",
  "I hope you won't do that.",
  "But, Mr. Kneedler, simply giving -- giving the phrase, substantially advance, the -- the more modest meaning that you argue for doesn't solve the problem. The -- the statement in Agins would still be incorrect. Agins says that the application of a general zoning law to a particular property effects a taking if the ordinance does not substantially advance legitimate State interests.",
  "I mean, so we have to eat crow no matter what we do. Right?",
  "So why -- why go through all the trouble of, you know, redefining substantially affects?",
  "Yes.",
  "I didn't understand you as saying that all rent control constitutes a taking. I thought it is only unintelligent rent control that constitutes a taking.",
  "Or do you not think that any rent control is intelligent?",
  "I must say I agree with Justice Souter. It seems to me if you say -- you're saying it doesn't make sense, so you got to pay for it. I think it -- it's much more reasonable to say it doesn't make sense, so you can't do it. Why isn't the latter the -- the intelligent reaction?",
  "Could I -- I -- I guess I'm not following this. I don't know why, Mr. Smiland, you -- you have not referred to the last sentence of -- of what you assert was the waiver of sovereign immunity, which says any suit pursuant to this section may be brought in any United States district court in the State in which the land involved is situated. Why isn't that what you're relying on?",
  "I -- I take that to mean that when you sue one defendant and you also sue the United States as a necessary party defendant, that suit -- any -­ that would be a suit pursuant to this section. I -- I don't know what other meaning that -- that sentence could have. When you sue two parties, one of whom is the United States, by reason of the fact that it's a necessary party defendant, that suit is a suit pursuant this section and it can be brought in any United States district court in the State in which the land involved is situated. I -- I don't know what -- what other suit that -- that sentence could refer to.",
  "Could -- could we hear your argument on -- on the sovereign immunity point as opposed to the venue point? What -- on what ground do you say the United States has waived its -- its immunity from suit in this case?",
  "Can you turn to sovereign immunity now?",
  "And -- and let me make -- make it easy for you. Do you know of any case, other than cases decided by this friendly district judge, in which a suit has been allowed against the United States based on nothing more than the status as a third party beneficiary of a contract to which the United States has -- on which the United States has agreed to be sued? Is -- is there any such case?",
  "And -- and you think it's clear that -- as our sovereign immunity law requires, that such a third party beneficiary can sue the United States?",
  "I -- I don't understand that. The rights were all inclusive. As -- as I understand the law of third party beneficiaries, it -- it used to be -- and -- and perhaps at the time this statute was enacted still was -- quite -­ quite restrictive. It's only in more recent -- I don't agree with the Government's argument that -- that you have to, in an ordinary contract, explicitly refer to the third party beneficiary's rights. But when sovereign immunity is at issue, it's -- it's a different question, it seems to me.",
  "Because -- because we have a rule that says when Congress wants the United States to be sued, it -- it must say so clearly.",
  "But you haven't really achieved very much efficiency if you simply get the United States out of the business of collecting the payments and of keeping track of the payments but leave the United States subject to suit when the person who has authority to do -­ do these things goofs. I mean, what -- what trouble has the United States saved itself? It would still have to ride herd over -- over the person with -- with whom it's dealing.",
  "But the -- the Justice Department has no authority to -- to consent to suit which -- which Congress has not consented to. I don't see how this strengthens your case.",
  "And this alone wouldn't -­ wouldn't remedy the -­",
  "-- the absence -­",
  "And no money damages.",
  "There has to be an ongoing suit. You think this section does -- does not permit somebody to initiate suit against one party and at the same time against the United States as a necessary party.",
  "Why what is the case?",
  "You -- that is to say, there's a suit between only two individuals and then the United States is brought in.",
  "I understand that. That's one situation that this provision could cover, but there are other situations that this provision could -- could cover. Let's say a farmer wants to bring suit against the district, but it doesn't really know whether the fault is with the district or whether the district was -- was compelled to do what it did by the United States. So it sues the district and just in case the United States was -- was responsible, it joins the United States. Why doesn't the language entirely permit that kind of a suit?",
  "Then -- then how do you explain the last -- the last sentence of that provision, which is any suit pursuant to this section? The only suit that the section refers to is a suit in which the United States is joined as a necessary party defendant. That's the subject of the section.",
  "And -- and the last sentence says, any suit pursuant to this section may be brought in any United States district court. And I read that to mean if you want to sue the United States as a necessary party initiating a suit, you can bring it in -- in any district court in which the land involved is.",
  "What about the second sentence? The United States, when a party, shall be deemed to have waived any right to plead that it is not amenable thereto by reason of its sovereignty and shall be subject to judgments, orders, and decrees of the court having jurisdiction and may obtain review thereof in the same manner and to the same extent? It's subject to the judgments, orders, and decrees of the court to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances. Why isn't that enough to -- to say that the court can -­ can award damages?",
  "Separate from -- where does that -- that obligation come from?",
  "That's a State -- a State­ created obligation?",
  "Excuse me. Could you expand on the first point a little bit? I mean, you say you don't want to be bothered with lawsuits. Is -- is that -- is that all that it amounts to?",
  "Can't -- can't such a suit be brought in State court? I can't believe that this district can do whatever it wants with the water.",
  "Really?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, the suit in State court, I assume, would -- would only be -- the claim would be that you were acting arbitrarily, and so long as your interpretation of the contract was a reasonable one, the suit would fail.",
  "Whereas, this suit here -- it doesn't matter how reasonable it is. If it's wrong, it's wrong. I mean, it's quite a different -­",
  "If -­",
  "No. I've asked a lot of questions. Go on.",
  "Well, I think it's arbitrary not to -- not to -- for an agency, of which you're -­ you're in some sense at least the beneficiary, not to insist upon its contract rights, just as a shareholder can insist that the -- that a corporation enforce its contracts.",
  "No, he was wrong. That was -­",
  "Who cares?",
  "Do you know how many claims in this case that -- that were not in the Delaware case?",
  "Ms. Castanias -­",
  "-- could -- could I come back to mootness? One -- one could say that not only is claim preclusion the answer to Rooker-Feldman, it's also the answer to the asserted mootness here. I mean, you -- you don't have to move to dismiss it as moot. All you have to do is move to dismiss because of a prior adjudication that has resolved this question. Do you know of any case in which the existence of a prior judgment in another court has been held to render a suit that someone wants to press to get a second judgment moot? I mean, you'd think there would be a case on that, and I suppose the reason there isn't is that because the other side is always going to plead res judicata.",
  "Or give up. But is there any case in which mootness is established by the fact that there is a prior judgment of another court giving you what you are asking for from this Court?",
  "Well, I -- I don't know why -­ well, if it's -- if it were so classic, there would be a lot of cases, and I don't -- I'm not sure that any of yours are right on point. And -- and I think the reason is that you don't need it, that claim preclusion is -- is the remedy for the party who wants to get out of it.",
  "I think I wrote that opinion.",
  "I never did like it.",
  "Well, that depends on who wins.",
  "I mean, if you lost in the other suit, your claim here wouldn't be moot. I mean, it -- it would be precluded, but it's certainly not moot.",
  "We -- we could -- we could require ships that are docked in the United States to pay their crews according to United States Jones Act requirements or United States minimum wage laws and so forth. We don't do that. We could do it, but we don't because it conflicts with -- with the law of the flag and -- and that's the usual -- it's not a matter of our power to do it. We could do it, of course, but it's just not something we ordinarily do.",
  "Was -- was that the ship or was it longshoremen?",
  "Longshoremen. Longshoremen based -- based on shore. Right?",
  "That's a different - -",
  "It's cheaper. It's cheaper too.",
  "We're not questioning the authority. We're questioning whether Congress intended that to be the case. We have a rule that -- that requires a clear statement when it has effects of this sort.",
  "When -- when the ship is out on the high seas?",
  "You think that's a hard question - -",
  "-- whether that's an extraterritorial application of U.S. law?",
  "I don't know what extraterritorial application means if it doesn't mean that, that a ship that is not in the United States is bound by United States law. What -- why isn't that extraterritorial application?",
  "Don't -- don't all - -",
  "It depends on what -- what kind of laws you're talking about. Laws that require the crew to be treated differently are -- are quite different from law -- laws that -- that require a passenger to be treated a certain way in the United States.",
  "And laws -- laws that require structural alteration of a ship are quite different from laws that say while you're in United States waters, you won't discriminate on the basis of race.",
  "If we haven't expressed it yet, we ought to express it then.",
  "Why don't you -- why don't you try to draw that line? Why don't you say that just as the applicability or not may depend upon whether you're dealing with a crew of a foreign ship or whether you're dealing with an American who happens to be injured on board that ship, so also it may depend upon whether the anti-discrimination law in question is one that at least in some of its applications requires structural changes or not? That would enable you to say the ADA doesn't apply, but would not compel you to say that title II doesn't apply.",
  "You're not willing to take such a limited position.",
  "Do we need -- do we need a clear statement for United States ships? I thought your case rested on a clear statement requirement. Is there any clear statement requirement for U.S. ships?",
  "So why -- why isn't there a clear difference between the two?",
  "Well, that's pretty good, isn't it?",
  "If you don't require a clear statement, that's -- that's good enough, it seems to me.",
  "Your -- your case hangs on the fact that, you know, when Congress wants to -- to rule the world and say all ships in the -- in the world that touch at our ports have to have this kind of a thing, it says so clearly. It doesn't have to say so with perfect clarity with respect to American ships.",
  "What's -- what's the full sweep argument? I don't --",
  "When you say different, you mean you cannot comply with both.",
  "Is that what you mean? Or - - or are those just minimums and -- and the United States would -- would comply with those minimums?",
  "Well, it depends on what the exceptions are. If -- if -- as -- here I understand there are three exceptions.",
  "And they're all spelled out in the statute.",
  "Yes. And -- and if you do not plead any of those exceptions when you -- when you file, it seems to me it's not properly filed.",
  "I don't care what the Pennsylvania law is. I mean, it -- it seems to me if you have a statute that says it's untimely unless one of these three exceptions apply, and -- and you -- you simply file and you don't say -- and it's clearly out of time without one of the exceptions, and you simply file and don't say but this exception applies, it seems to me that's not properly filed, whatever the rule in -- in Pennsylvania was.",
  "But you haven't pleaded any of them, none at all. You just file it - -",
  "-- several years out of time. You -- you make no assertion that any one of the -- of the three specific exceptions applies. I don't see how that could possibly be considered properly filed.",
  "Ah, that -- that's your theory that -- that --",
  "Unless it can be rejected by the clerk - -",
  "But you haven't made the claim.",
  "And you say that if that's the case, you can file a -- a State -- a State claim that is plainly no good and until the State court finally gets around to -- to telling you that it's no good, your - - your AEDPA claim is tolled.",
  "This is putting such a -- I mean, the system is not going to work. It -- it's a rare State system that has an absolute statute of limitation with no exceptions. You're almost going to have to inquire into exceptions. So you're saying this is a way to avoid -- avoid AEDPA endlessly, just keep filing claims that are out of time, and until the court finally gets around to saying it's out of time, your -- your AEDPA time is tolled - -",
  "-- by which time you file another one that's clearly out of time. And until that one is resolved -- I -- this couldn't be what AEDPA was - - was meant to establish.",
  "Try -- try this simple rule. Where you're dealing with a statute of limitations that has exceptions, it's not properly filed if you do not assert the existence of one of those exceptions.",
  "Why -- why not? We make up a lot of stuff.",
  "I thought the whole purpose of AEDPA was -- was to prevent delay. I mean, that's - - that's what's -- it seems to me counter-intuitive about the position you're -- you're urging upon us. Here is a statute that was meant to stop these things from dragging on endlessly.",
  "And you tell us don't worry about these things dragging on endlessly.",
  "That's unrealistic if the States allow you to file a lot of stuff. You're -- you're saying the only way the States can stop this thing from going on and on and on is to adopt an absolute rigid statute of limitations, no exceptions.",
  "Give me another way.",
  "Do you think that's a reasonable interpretation of properly filed and -- and what I proposed to you is not a reasonable interpretation of properly filed?",
  "How can you -- how can you tease that elaborate system out of -- out of the words properly filed but you cannot tease out of it - -",
  "-- simply showing on its face that there's either an absolute statute or that one of the exceptions to the statute exists?",
  "The circumstances included the fact that he sat on this thing for 3 years. He could have brought it 3 years earlier, couldn't he?",
  "The claim, yes, that's right.",
  "So -- when -- when you -- when you fold that into the circumstances, it doesn't seem to me an overwhelming case for equitable tolling.",
  "-- take a whole lot to figure out that you have a claim where your lawyer told you - - you weren't going up for life and it turned out you were sent up for life.",
  "I mean, what does it take if - - can a 17-year-old figure that something has gone wrong here?",
  "Why -- why are there thousands of cases in which noncapital defendants file this type of case? What -- what incentives do noncapital defendants have to drag it on?",
  "Who -- who should -- whose responsibility should it be to get something like that into the record? I mean, I read it. I don't -- I have no idea whether there was a good reason for the shackling or not.",
  "Those -- those are all, are they not, cases involving the -- the guilt phase of -- of a trial? Right?",
  "Well, this is a little different. He -- I mean, when you shackle somebody who hasn't yet been convicted, you -- you send a message to the jury that, you know, this -- this person belongs in irons. But the jury had already found this person guilty.",
  "He was -- he was convicted.",
  "Should that make no difference?",
  "Guilty.",
  "Can -- can I ask you? You say counsel proposed some alternatives to -- to the visible shackling. Did counsel object that there shouldn't have been any shackling at all?",
  "Okay.",
  "But he did take the position that there was no need for shackles at all.",
  "Are you sure that it's as -- as prejudicial in the -- in the penalty phase as it is in the guilt phase? I mean, in the guilt phase, it does make the person look like a criminal. In the penalty phase, I -­ I'm really not sure if I -- if I were a prosecutor whether I would prefer to have the defendant shackled or not. The issue before the jury is whether to leave this person in his -- in his current incarcerated state for life or to execute him. And I -- I might think that showing, you know, what -- what kind of an existence it is to be -- to be a life prisoner walking around with the legirons and chains -- I'm not sure that that is going to cut in favor of the jury's giving the death penalty or -- or to the contrary, make the juror think, boy, what a wretched life this is and -- and that ought to be enough.",
  "It's --",
  "-- it's still an oppressive reminder of -- of how this individual, if sentenced to life, is -- is subject to -- to the orders of prison authorities which on some occasions will subject him to this kind of restraint. I -- once again, if I were a prosecutor, I'd rather have him dressed up in a nice, new suit and his hair combed and smiling. I would much prefer that to having him in shackles.",
  "I gather there was some evidence or perhaps it's conceded that he was put on a suicide watch before his first trial. This was the second trial. Right?",
  "That he had been put on a suicide watch and that he had tried to injure himself by knocking his head against the cell wall?",
  "What if -- what if the judge had specifically stated I'm putting him in irons because the man is -- is violent enough towards himself or others that I'm worried about the safety of the jury.",
  "What if the judge had said that?",
  "Would that have been enough?",
  "Why don't you limit it to double murderers anyway?",
  "Okay.",
  "Ms. Nield, is -- is the State making a harmless error argument here? I really couldn't tell from your brief whether you're doing it or not. Are -- are -- is the State asserting that assuming it -­ assuming it was wrong, assuming it was a violation, this jury would have -- would have come out the same way anyway?",
  "Why is that?",
  "What -- what specific aggravating circumstances did they jury find? You say there are statutory aggravating circumstances in Missouri.",
  "And the jury found -- there are five.",
  "And the jury found all five.",
  "Six.",
  "But answer his question. Give him an example of where it -- it wouldn't be harmless error.",
  "Assuming that it is a violation, what's an example of where it wouldn't be harmless error?",
  "Or I suppose if future dangerousness was a specific aggravating factor under State law, as it is in Texas, for example -­",
  "-- then -- then you would concede that if this was unlawful, the error clearly would not be harmless.",
  "That was at this trial or at the first trial, that -­",
  "I don't understand what you mean, sometimes you'll have to dismiss the entire case.",
  "Oh, is indispensable.",
  "I -- I don't know what you mean when you say they -- they don't destroy complete diversity. You mean that the original plaintiff and the original defendant are still who they used to be?",
  "Well, you -- you could say the same thing about -- about a -- a second claim that destroys diversity. You could say the same thing. Does that -- does that -- does the absence of diversity in this second claim destroy the diversity that existed in the first claim?",
  "I mean, no, I doesn't. I mean, the diversity that existed in the first claim is still there.",
  "Mr. Chemerinsky, I suppose that opening statement suggests that you think that Thanksgiving proclamations are also unconstitutional, which were recommended by the very first Congress, the same Congress that proposed the First Amendment.",
  "They also refer to one God, to a theistic ruler of the universe.",
  "All right. But then you have to narrow your opening statement and say that certainly the State can acknowledge the existence of a unitary God without offending the Establishment Clause.",
  "But the prayers in Congress don't do that and our Thanksgiving proclamations don't do that. They invoke a God, a unitary God, and that's contrary to the dictates of some religions that believe that there are a lot of gods.",
  "We don't pray to gods, the prayers are always to God. You know, I don't see why the one is good and the other is bad. It's no answer to say, well, you know, the former has been around for a long time. Well, it has but it suggests what the framers and what our society for several means. And it does not -- it is not too sectarian if it invokes a unitary God. Now, you're saying it becomes too sectarian when it invokes the Ten Commandments.",
  "I thought Muslims accept the Ten Commandments.",
  "And when somebody goes by that monument, I don't think they're studying each one of the commandments. It's a symbol of the fact that government comes -- derives its authority from God. And that is, it seems to me, an appropriate symbol to be on State grounds.",
  "It is a profound religious message, but it's a profound religious message believed in by the vast majority of the American people, just as belief in monotheism is shared by a vast majority of the American people. And our traditions show that there is nothing wrong with the government reflecting that. I as the majority has to be tolerant of minority views in matters of religion, it seems to me the minority has to be tolerant of the majority's ability to express its belief that government comes from God, which is what this is about. As Justice Kennedy said, turn your eyes away if it's such a big deal to you.",
  "What about the opening of this Court's session today, in a manner that has been used since John Marshall, is that divisive because there are a lot of people who don't believe in God.",
  "Who are you kidding? I They're saying these basic principles of And that message would be conveyed so long as you use the terminology of the Ten Commandments. That's what the Ten Commandments stand for.",
  "Can the State express its support for religion generally?",
  "Suppose it didn't have the Ten Commandments, it just had a big thing that says religion is good. It said religion is the foundation of our institutions. Suppose there were something like that. Would that be bad?",
  "But there are atheists who disagree with that intensely.",
  "Doesn't it matter whether that text has acquired an independent meaning of its own? As I say, I don't think most people know what the text of the Ten Commandments are, but they do know that it stands for the fact that our laws are derived from God. That's what it stands for. Why isn't that symbolism sufficient to enable the State of Texas to use it?",
  "It's not a secular message. I mean, if you're watering it down to say that the only reason it's okay is it sends nothing but a secular message, I can't agree with you. I think the message it sends is that law is -- and our institutions come from God. And if you don't think it conveys that message, I just think you're kidding yourself.",
  "But we know what they are, don't we?",
  "And it doesn't matter what the version is, does it? If it just stands for the fact that laws -- the foundation of our laws is God. If that's all it stands for, who cares what the text is.",
  "Well, why don't you do it and we wouldn't have this case? I really would consider it something of a Pyrrhic victory if you win on the cases, we're going to have to examine displays of the Ten Commandments to see whether there was ever any intent to say that our laws are ultimately dependent upon God. Is that what you want us to do case by case?",
  "What if its purpose were to demonstrate -- and I quote from one of our earlier opinions -- that we are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. What if that were its purpose? Would that have made it bad?",
  "Do you think the Ten Commandments are longer than the legislative prayers you've heard at the beginning of congressional sessions?",
  "I don't know what you mean by the acknowledgment context.",
  "I'm not sure we don't deal with it. I don't know who we're addressing when we say God save the United States and this Honorable Court.",
  "I don't care it stands for that. As you heard, the code takes various forms for various religions. And I think all it stands for is the proposition that the moral order is ordained by God. That's all it stands for. And to say that that's the basis of the Declaration of Independence and of our institutions is entirely realistic.",
  "I don't think they're really saying that the particular commandments of the Ten Commandments are the basis of the Declaration of Independence. That's idiotic. What the commandments stand for is the direction of human affairs by God. That's what it stands for.",
  "If that's what it means, it's idiotic. I don't think anybody is going to interpret it that way. You can't get the Declaration of Independence out of the Ten Commandments.",
  "And I don't think that's how somebody would normally read it. I think what they're saying is the principle of laws being ordained by God is the foundation of the laws of this state and the foundation of our legal system.",
  "Well, RFRA didn't involve a -­ a limitation to situations in which Federal funds were involved, and as I understand this statute does.",
  "More than also. I -- that seems to me the principal difference between this and RFRA.",
  "I don't -- I don't understand, Mr. Clement, how your second point strengthens your first point. That is to say, if we disagree with your first point, namely that the institutionalized persons provisions are consistent with the Establishment Clause, we think that they contradict the Establishment Clause, they couldn't possibly be saved by your second point. Can you require as a -- as a condition of -- under the Spending Clause that a State violate the Establishment Clause?",
  "Is Satanism a non-mainstream religion?",
  "What does this have to do with it? The Royal Navy you say?",
  "Our Royal Navy?",
  "I'm -- I'm sorry. You've lost me. I don't know what you mean about shifting burdens to third parties. What -­",
  "Mr. Cole, are you sure that this statute doesn't go beyond pre-Smith -- our pre-Smith law? I'm not aware that our pre-Smith law would have defined religious exercise as broadly as this statute defines it. I guess this is something Mr. Clement ought to speak to as well. It says, the term religious exercise includes any exercise of religion whether or not compelled by or central to a system of religious belief.",
  "Did our prior Smith cases go that far? I'm not aware that -­",
  "They don't even have to say my -- my religion requires me not to eat this food. They just say, you know, I'm -­",
  "Yes.",
  "I think -- I think you may exaggerate what it takes to establish a compelling State interest. I mean, we -- this -- this Court held in the -­ in the pre-Smith days that it was a compelling State interest to -- to prevent members of the Air Force from wearing yarmulkes. I mean, if that's a compelling State interest, I think it's pretty easy to get most anything declared a -- a compelling State interest under this statute, don't you think?",
  "And that goes beyond pre-Smith too, doesn't it? Least restrictive alternative.",
  "And they're not burdening you anyway -- anyway. Just don't take the money.",
  "It comes with the money.",
  "You don't want the burden? Don't take the money. I mean, they -- they do that all the time.",
  "What we have before us in this case is -- is a case covered by the -- the Spending Clause. So we don't have to grapple with the Commerce Clause for now.",
  "Why is it -- why is it worse for -- for judges to be overseers of religious life in prison than it is for wardens to be overseers of religious life in prison? I mean, somebody has to say what the lines are, what will -- what will be accommodated and what won't.",
  "And that someone is going to be a government official. I have no reason to believe that wardens are -- are better at it than judges except with respect to, you know, security and administrative convenience, which we will honor under this statute.",
  "And I think that means that they will give great deference to what the -- what the wardens of the prisons say is a compelling interest of -­ of the penal system.",
  "Also not compelled -- not compelled -- by religion. You just say, you know, I -- I want to give up everything except candy for Lent, and the -- the prison has to accommodate you. Right?",
  "It's not compelled. I -- you know, I could do something else. But I had thought that our prior religion cases did -- did, indeed, require some religious compulsion than just I -- you know, I'd like to do this as a religious matter.",
  "I guess you're right. I think I was thinking of free exercise cases rather than establishment cases.",
  "So do you concede that if shall means shall, that it creates a property interest?",
  "Wait, wait. I thought we were just talking here about state law as to whether shall means shall. Do you think that it's a matter of state law whether, if it does mean shall, it creates a property interest for purposes of the Federal Constitution?",
  "You don't concede that that's a state question at all?",
  "Perhaps what you mean is that what is a property interest for purposes of Colorado law, if Colorado chooses to nominate some utterly zany thing of property interest, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a property interest for purposes of the Federal Constitution.",
  "I don't think you need a case for that, do you?",
  "Do we have any cases involving a zany property interest having been found by a State? I don't think we have any.",
  "What's your response to the fact that the Tenth Circuit found otherwise and that we usually defer?",
  "The Constitution does say property right. I mean, it has to be a property right, doesn't it? Is that meaningless? Is everything in the world either life, liberty or property? Does that describe everything in the world?",
  "Well, because there has been no case that really did not involve something that could reasonably be called property.",
  "That's the State's problem. I mean, if the State doesn't want that, sure, the State can take that away. But if the State does, do I still have to call it property just because the State does?",
  "Why was your procedure, assuming your entitled to a procedure, why did it have to come from Castle Rock? Why wasn't your proper recourse to the court that issued the restraining order? Did you try to do that, to go to the judge that issued the restraining order and say, the police are not enforcing the restraining order that you issued, I would like directive from the court that they enforce it?",
  "Well, just as she could have complained to the police earlier, she could have gone to the court earlier when she saw that the police weren't doing anything.",
  "That may be a tort, but it's not necessarily a denial of process if the proper place to seek that process was from the court that issued the restraining order.",
  "That's right, and the court can make sure that they enforce it upon complaint.",
  "Mr. Reichel, how would you describe, briefly, the property that your client has been deprived of? What is the property?",
  "The entitlement to enforcement of an order is property? Do you know any case that is -- what's the closest case that you would say has held something to be property that is an entitlement to have an order enforced as opposed to an entitlement to a job, an entitlement to money, an entitlement to what I would consider property?",
  "Yes, but it's, at the end of the day, they were unemployment benefits, right? I mean -­",
  "But there is no contract here, is there?",
  "Well, but that doesn't -­",
  "Well, it also can't be the rule that poor people can defame ad libitum and -- and people who have money cannot. I mean, that's -- that's not a fair rule either.",
  "It's worthless against a -­ against a person who has no assets.",
  "Not -- not this injunction. The question presented is whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation -- in a defamation action, preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure, violates the First Amendment. There's no suggestion in that that you claim that in this particular case there was no defamation. I -- I just don't think it's fairly included within the question.",
  "No, it doesn't. It says whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation action preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure violates the First Amendment.",
  "There's nothing about this particular injunction which is based upon speech that is not defamation. There's nothing in there about that.",
  "Why can't we say that speech that is -- is being used for extortion is different, just as speech which is being used for harassment is different? And just as you can get an injunction for the latter, you ought to be able to get an injunction for the former. Not all speech, but only when speech is being used to -- to extort money.",
  "Here I think there was -- why isn't there a use of fear when, you know, you're afraid of this person destroying your business by calling you a liar and a cheat? Wasn't Mr. Cochran afraid of that -- of that happening?",
  "I understand. Mr. Chemerinsky, let me put the question this way. Suppose a State does not have a civil action for extortion. It provides criminal remedies but no civil action for extortion. Why does the Constitution not permit us to treat, in that State at least, a civil action for defamation which has within it elements of distortion differently from pure defamation?",
  "You don't know that.",
  "You don't know what future speech is going to be. His future thing may be, you know, Johnnie Cochran shouldn't be elected mayor of San Francisco. That would be a -- a question of public concern.",
  "Well, it's -- it's -­",
  "That's right. It's -­",
  "Why? Why couldn't he just be enjoined from -- from similar defamation? I mean, this -­ this enjoins him from -- from true speech. At least he could -- he could have been enjoined from in the future defaming Cochran in the same manner. And if he did that, then -- then he could be punished.",
  "I think he'd like to get him up to San Francisco.",
  "That's what he's arguing. You're -- you're conceding that it's overbroad.",
  "Ah, you're very perceptive.",
  "Would -- would that make Mr. Cochran happy? What -- what's the big deal about extortion? I mean, suppose this same conduct occurs in the future, but he doesn't say I'll stop if you give me a lot of money. He just pickets every day and says Cochran is a shyster, don't do any business with Cochran. Do you think Mr. Cochran would be any -- any happier simply because the guy says I'll -- hasn't said I'll stop if you pay me $10,000?",
  "You've got to give us some line. I mean, the only reason we're grabbing onto extortion is that -- that there's reluctance to say you can issue injunctions in all defamation actions. Now, what -- what limitation do you want to place upon the ability to issue an injunction if it is not defamation combined with extortion?",
  "Of course, if -- if you said a district court, one district judge could -- could trigger the thing for the whole country. That -­",
  "Yes.",
  "Crazy.",
  "You -- you don't know who's responsible for writing this, do you?",
  "Right.",
  "The proximity of the reference to the Supreme Court there really -­",
  "-- when you read it the first time, you think they're talking about the Supreme Court.",
  "Has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable.",
  "Mr. Feldman, is there any case in which the Supreme Court newly recognizes a right in which it does not initially recognize the right?",
  "Well, they're -- they're -- I thought your position was newly recognized means that it -- it has to be the kind of a right that would -- would overcome our usual bar to -- to, you know, rights that existed before.",
  "Every -- every newly recognized is an -- is an initially recognized, although every initially recognized is not necessarily a newly recognized. Is that it?",
  "The other way around?",
  "You don't know who wrote this either, do you?",
  "Sure.",
  "Which would have been the date on which it was newly recognized.",
  "So why couldn't they say, the date on which the right asserted was newly recognized by the Supreme Court if it has been made retroactively applicable? Wouldn't that have been a more -­",
  "Well, it didn't newly -- it didn't newly recognize it either, did it?",
  "It was -- it recognized that when it would be initially recognized, it would be newly initially recognized.",
  "I see your point.",
  "Not your fault.",
  "Mr. Utrecht, you -- you refer to the primacy of Federal courts. I'm -- I'm not clear as to whether you are arguing for a different disposition where a suit is first brought in Federal court erroneously because there's been no exhaustion and then the plaintiff is sent back to State court from the situation in which a plaintiff does the right thing and goes to State court immediately. Now, in that case, would -- would you still argue for primacy of the Federal court?",
  "So -- so your case does not hinge on the fact that when the State court acted, there was a pending -- a pending Federal case asking for the Federal constitutional question to be resolved by a Federal court.",
  "And you don't want us get that -- to that question either, whether Dolan applies or not.",
  "I thought they said that their -- their compensation law was congruent with ours?",
  "What do you -- what do you think that means?",
  "If you -- if you disagreed with the resolution of an issue by the State court, which issue would be determinative of your Federal claim, if we hold against you here? Do you think you would have a right to appeal that State court -- State Supreme Court resolution of that issue to this Court?",
  "What -- what strikes me as strange about this -- this system is -- is not leaving it to the State courts to make these decisions. That's perfectly fine. We do that all the time. But these are decisions that are going to be conclusive on -- on a Federal claim, and yet there's no way to -- to appeal from the State Supreme Court here.",
  "Of course, they could have come up here, though. I mean, maybe that was their mistake in not making their Federal claim in the California court. The California court would have denied their State claim, presumably denied their Federal claim, and -- and both could have come up here I suppose. Or -- or would the California's -- would California's determination of the State questions preclude a separate determination of the Federal questions?",
  "Do you think -- do you think that the President can enter into a treaty, with the approval of Congress, that would provide that, in a particular combat, the Commander in Chief will be somebody other than the President of the United States?",
  "Right.",
  "And you think that the Constitution provides the President shall be Commander in Chief, and, therefore, that can't be given away.",
  "Right?",
  "Right. Well, what if I think that the Constitution provides that all questions of federal law -- statutory, treaty, constitutional -- are to be decided, ultimately, by the Supreme Court of the United States. Can a treaty give that away?",
  "It does if we're bound by the determination of Avena. It does if I have to believe that individual rights were created here, without reexamining the question on my own.",
  "Not a question concerning United States law.",
  "You're talking here about a question of United States law, What is the meaning of this treaty that the United States has entered into? Do you know another case where we have -- we have been bound by a judgement of a foreign court or an international court concerning the meaning of United States law?",
  "That was not an interpretation that ousted this Court of jurisdiction over the matter, though, was it?",
  "Don't you think that's a little bit different?",
  "That doesn't -- that doesn't involve an interpretation of the treaty that is rendered by somebody else and that is binding upon this Court. I mean, it's just a matter of different magnitude. To say that there can be private claims, fine; but that doesn't say that the interpretation of a treaty entered into the by the United States is subject to a court, other than this Court.",
  "Except that the President doesn't think that the remedy is in federal habeas. The President thinks that the remedy is within the states.",
  "Now, that -­",
  "-- that's an interesting question. Let's turn from the more cosmic questions into how you overcome the impediment that in order to get a Certificate of Appealability here, you have to show that there was -- you have to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. What constitutional right has been denied here?",
  "No, I take -­",
  "-- that question to be a jurisdictional question, as far as the lower court is concerned; and, therefore, I think it's a jurisdictional question for us.",
  "Yes, but -­",
  "Do you know of any -­",
  "-- do you know of any case in which a lower court did not have jurisdiction, but we do have jurisdiction on appeal from in a -- from a court that didn't have jurisdiction?",
  "Well, if the -­",
  "-- had jurisdiction to -­",
  "They really are interesting, you know.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, how many -- how many states are we talking about for these 51 individuals involved in the case? How many different states?",
  "It's conceivable that those five or six states could say, \"The President has no authority to do this,\" ground one. Ground two, \"Even if he did, on the merits, we reexamine.\" So the whole thing could go away.",
  "Why? Why is that reasonable? I mean, why is it offered to the public if it's offered alone, but it's not offered to the public if it's offered with a tie-in? I mean, if -- you know, if I say, you know, I'm selling you a windshield alone, I guess I'm offering a windshield. But if I say, you know, you've got to buy the windshield with a car, am I any less selling you a windshield?",
  "Well, suppose I just tie it in with windshield wipers.",
  "You can only buy my windshield if you buy the windshield wipers with it. Am I no longer selling a windshield because I'm selling it with -- only with windshield wipers?",
  "Fifty-fifty.",
  "But don't you think that the telecommunications aspect of what's going on here is at least as important as the information aspect of it? The information is useless unless it can be conveyed.",
  "Not necessarily. You could -­ you can use that broadband service to go to other information providers.",
  "I understand that.",
  "I agree, but the question isn't whether it doesn't do anything; the question is whether you are still offering telecommunications services to the public. And it seems to me -- look it, I offer you broadband, initially without any information function at the end of it, and you're using this broadband to do all sorts of good stuff, going where you want, getting what you want, conveying what you want. And then I change my rules and I say, \"You know, in the future the only way I'm offering this broadband is if you, in addition to buying the broadband communications capacity, buy my information technology at the end of it.\" Have I suddenly stopped selling the broadband -- or offering the broadband to the public? I just don't think that's a reasonable -­",

  "With respect to the telephone long-lines, you say, yes, you are; and with respect to cable, you say, no, you aren't.",
  "I understand what -­",
  "-- they're saying, but they're doing it all on policy grounds. This definition means this, because that produces a good result. With respect to telephone lines, they say, yes, bundled is, or it isn't, depending upon whether we like the result it produces.",
  "It just doesn't seem to -­",
  "Well, that's wonderful policy -­",

It is saying, in some cases, that a bundled offering is an offering of telecommunications; and, in other cases, it's saying a bundled offering isn't. And the reason, you say, is not because of the nature of the thing, because of the definition, it's because you tell us it has good consequences in one case, and doesn't have good consequences in the other.",

We -- we had a case some years ago in which both sides apparently wanted the statute in existence and they conceded in the -- in the court of appeals that the statute existed and wanted us to say what this presumptively existing statute said. And we held, since there was serious doubt about whether the statute had been properly enacted, we had to reach that question first because we were not going to speculate on what a, you know, hypothetical statute said. And I think you're asking us to do sort of the same thing here. You're -- if -- you know, without even conceding or -- the Government doesn't concede anyway. The United States doesn't.",

Let's say both parties agree about the law, but the fact that is determinative of nothing, except the operation of Federal law, is at issue.

What -- what if this were just a factual dispute about the operation of Federal law? What would we do with it? Does the fact that it's a factual dispute make it not substantial, not a substantial Federal question?",

  "May I suggest you might have put the high threshold because it's a threshold that judges are familiar with and can use, whereas reason to inquire would be a fine test for when a judge is permitted to demand a response but it cannot possibly be a test for when a judge is required to demand a -- what does -- what does reason to inquire mean? Is that a -- is that a standard that -- that can be applied in law?",

Once you have that lenient test, I don't know why you have to exclude the speculation. I mean, there -- what if all three of the blacks -- it's a case in which the -- the visual evidence is significant and all three of the blacks are blind and - - and you tell me the judge has to say, oh, no, it -- it can't be that -- that reason that they were stricken. That doesn't make any sense.",
  "Why do we need the same -- the same rules for State and Federal courts? You have here the California Supreme Court. Why do they have to use the same -- the same minuet that the Federal courts do?",

  "Why can't -- why can't the Batson question similarly be decided but decided under State rules of procedure?",
  "So you would have no objection to our limiting our opinion, saying, you know, reversing and remanding and saying this is not Federal law. It's not what we would do in Federal court. Of course, the California Supreme Court is free to have some different system.",
  "No, you don't want us to do that, do you?",
  "I mean, you -- you can say that its words say that, but what it does doesn't say that. I mean, to establish a prima facie case, all you have to show is that -- that you were qualified for the job, you're a member of a minority, and you weren't hired, and somebody who's not a member of a minority was hired. Do you think that's enough to show that it's more likely than not that race was the basis and that's -- you know, that's how those cases pan out? That's enough for a prima facie case. Is that enough to say it's more likely than not that race was the reason?",
  "Really?",
  "Do you really believe that? I mean, in -- in a large -- you know, large -- large operation, you -- you're a minority. You apply for a job. You're qualified for it. You aren't hired, but somebody who's not a minority is hired. That alone, without any other information, is enough to enable somebody to find that it is more likely than not that -- that race was the reason? My goodness. I -- I don't think that's an accurate description.",

  "Mr. Schalit, can you give me some reason why I should care a whole lot about this? What's the big deal? I mean, so what if we adopt a very minimal standard. So what. It just means you have a bench conference and the -- and the judge asks, you know -- you know, you struck three -- three blacks. It, you know, looks suspicious to me. I'm not sure it's more likely than not. I'm not sure it's even enough to go to a jury, but it looks suspicious to me. Why just -- how come you -- you struck all three blacks that were in the venire? What is such a big deal about adopting a very - - a very low standard?",
  "What?",
  "Like -- like what?",
  "Well, I agree. Of course, the State has a -- has an interest in -- in exercising peremptories. But -- but why is it important that whether the State is doing it in a biased fashion be decided up front at step one instead of having the parties come to the judge and say, you know, why did you do it?",
  "That's what I can't understand, why that is so important to the State.",
  "But Batson overruled that. I mean, those days are gone. Tell California to stop worrying about that.",
  "You cannot make peremptory challenges for any reason anymore. You can't do it for any reason.",
  "So they're gone. Now, once you acknowledge they're gone, what's the big deal about - - about having the parties come up to the judge and just explain to the judge, we didn't do it for a racial reason?",
  "It's a New Hampshire rule.",
  "No, please, go ahead.",
  "Mr. Chan, there is really no way for the State entirely to protect itself by -- even by filing an answer immediately. That would protect it against the automatic acceptance of an amendment, but it wouldn't protect it against the District Judge's ability to grant an amendment after the response.",
  "There's no way to get any protection against that, no matter how promptly you respond.",
  "Why - -",
  "But you have more than Rule 11; you have Section 2244, which says that an application for habeas corpus, quote, \"may be amended as provided in the rules of procedure applicable to civil actions.\"",
  "So, I don't think it's even a close question whether the rules of procedure for amendment in civil actions apply.",
  "Well, that was -- that was a rule for tort cases; it wasn't a rule for habeas cases. And, as pointed out by the Government, habeas cases are fundamentally different, in that the notice that you give to the opposing party in tort cases, ordinary civil cases, is very vague. It's just, you know, what the event was, \"I got hit by a train.\" You don't have to say, \"Wherein, the train was negligent -- or the railroad was negligent,\" or anything else; just, \"I got hit by a train.\" Whereas, with respect to habeas corpus, there are rules that require specifying all the grounds for relief available to the Petitioner, state the facts supporting each ground. It seems to me that those different pleading requirements suggest that what is the relevant transaction or occurrence for the one is not the same as what is the relevant transaction or occurrence for the other.",
  "Can you file -- can you file a request for a more specific statement in habeas, as you can in a civil case?",
  "By whom? By whom? By which one of the two?",
  "Do we flip a coin?",
  "Why -- why is that? I mean, it seems to me due process requires that there be enough evidence to -- for a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that -- that the person was the shooter. And if in -- if there is, indeed, in both cases enough such evidence, it seems to me there is no denial of due process, and that the usual manner of accommodating for that apparent injustice is -- is for the Governor to grant clemency to one of the two, have him figure out which one of the two wasn't the shooter, or to apply for -- for reopening of the -- of the -- of one of cases. But I don't know that there is automatically a due process violation which allows one or the other of the cases - - proper convictions. Each one is fully proper. I don't know that there's a due process violation that allows one of them to be set aside.",
  "Due -- due process doesn't mean perfection. It doesn't mean that each jury has to always reach the right result.",
  "As I understand the facts, even if he hadn't shot the wife to death, which was what the prosecution was for, he had tried to kill the husband, shooting him twice in the head?",
  "From point-blank range.",
  "And then there was some discussion that the -- that the lying, seriously wounded husband heard between the two perpetrators, and then there was shooting of the wife. Whether he pulled the trigger or not, could that possibly make a difference? He did pull the trigger trying to kill the husband. Is it difficult to -- to think that -- that he willingly allowed his -- his cohort to do the same to the wife? I -- I can't imagine it would make any difference.",
  "Could -- could I get one fact? Wesley didn't confess or we don't know that he confessed. He -- he said he wasn't the shooter at trial, didn't he?",
  "But what was introduced was - - was the testimony of one of his jailhouse companions who said that Wesley had told him that he was the shooter. So who was the shooter was -- was as much an issue in Wesley's trial as it was in Stumpf's trial, wasn't it?",
  "What -- what page is that?",
  "What -- what was the due process violation here? You're talking about due process in the second trial, in - -",
  "Was in the first trial?",
  "But that's the trial that you're trying to get set aside here.",
  "Well, it was. They're - - they're just -- they're just arguing that the evidence we introduced supported the jury verdict. What -- what is wrong with arguing that? There's - -",
  "Not -- not if they said in the second trial it doesn't matter whether he's the shooter.",
  "Well, because it seems to me they -- they would have two arguments. One is even if he wasn't the shooter, you -- you should -- you would have imposed the death penalty anyway, but argument number two is, wait a minute. You know, yes, we -- we don't know who the shooter is but there's a -- there was no violation of due process here. There was plenty of evidence for you to find that he was the shooter. That evidence is still there. Do you expect them to throw away that argument? I mean, it's -- it's very true and it goes to whether this conviction and sentence deserve to be set aside.",
  "She asked as aider or abetter, not as shooter.",
  "I thought a State appellate court had effectively reweighed and effectively resentenced, saying that this additional evidence would, in our view, have made no difference. And we -- we allow that to happen all the time. We speculate as to what the -- what the sentencer would have done had an invalid factor not been there. I mean, when -- when a -- an aggravating factor is -- is invalidated, the State supreme court can determine, you know, whether the same sentence of death would have been imposed even without that aggravating factor. Why is this any different?",
  "Which one?",
  "What if -- what if Wesley comes in with a -- with a motion to vacate now and -- and he points to the inconsistency with the -- with the Stumpf trial? Would he also be entitled to get his sentence vacated because of the same inconsistency that you're pointing out?",
  "Yes.",
  "So a jury, having found both of them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and possibly on a basis that -- or not a jury but the judges and possibly on a basis that has nothing to do with whether they were the shooter, you think both of them are entitled to have the death sentence vacated. I think that's extraordinary.",
  "Which one? I mean, doesn't Wesley have just as much of a complaint as your client does?",
  "Why?",
  "No. That's -- that's my mistake.",
  "Mr. Rosenkranz, the items you listed earlier seemed to me to more narrow than what I took to be the point of your opening brief, which was that the decision below was wrong because the Federal Circuit simply excluded all consideration of materials prepared for purposes of the IND, as opposed to materials prepared for the -- for the drug application, later on. Are you abandoning that more expansive position?",
  "Because I don't read the opinion that way. I don't think that opinion has to be read to say that they're not going to allow in anything that goes to the IND.",
  "Have you answered my question? You're abandoning the assertion that the Federal Circuit did not consider anything that didn't go to the IND - - that didn't go to the - -",
  "-- drug application.",
  "Yes, but it -- it's not at all clear in the opinion that the Court was using preclinical and clinical in the very technical sense that you were - - that you use it, which means \"clinical\" is stuff submitted for the drug application, and \"preclinical\" is for the earlier application. That is not at all - -",
  "That - -",
  "But that might well determine whether the research was relatively directly related. I mean, if I were a juror, I would -- I would say it's relatively directly related if it relates to that particular compound which is ultimately submitted, and not relatively directly related if it was preliminary, trying to found out which compound to submit.",
  "Yes, I understand all that. But - -",
  "-- I'm just saying that that is certainly one interpretation of \"reasonably directly.\" And if that is so, then you are erroneous in your assumption that the question before this Court is the meaning of the statute. It might not be. It might be - - it might be the meaning of the instruction.",
  "Why isn't that basic research? I mean, I want to -- I want to treat this disease by stifling the development of blood cells around it, or something like that, and then you ask yourself, \"Gee, what would stifle the production of blood cells?\" And let's assume there hasn't been any research done in that field before. You wouldn't consider that basic research, so long as the idea I have in my -- in my head is, I want to create a drug to treat this disease that will stifle blood cells?",
  "No, but I think -- I think the Justice was asking whether it was the Court of Appeals that - -",
  "-- applied a particular standard. And certainly it had to have been. Didn't the Court of Appeals have a particular standard as to what constituted general biomedical experimentation, as opposed to the kind of experimentation that's covered by the -- by the safe harbor exemption? It must have had. I mean, how could you -- how could you rule on the question before you unless you have, in your head, a notion of what the safe harbor consists of and what is beyond it?",
  "That's the way I read it. It -- the -- and this is why I was disagreeing with counsel from the other side. It -- well, counsel ultimately conceded, you could read it not to draw the line between clinical and preclinical. And the way you read this sentence is -- the question, they say, is not whether preclinical research falls under 271(e)(1); it's whether the \"preclinical research conducted under the Scripps - Merck agreement.\" And then the next sentence explains what that means. The experiments did not supply information for submission to the United States Food and Drug Administration, but, instead, identified the best drug candidate. So, I think what they're describing as the question presented is whether preclinical research that is -- that is not directed to supplying information for submission to the Food and Drug Administration, but, instead, to selecting the drug candidate, whether that type of preclinical research is within the safe harbor.",
  "I don't -- so what? I don't understand what conclusion that leads to.",
  "I was beginning to think that, too.",
  "They could have done the same in 3731(c) also. Instead of just saying any action brought under section 3730, they could have said any action brought under -- which one? (a) of -- of -- which is the one that allows the Government suit?",
  "(a). They could have said (a), and they didn't. They said all of 3730.",
  "Sloppy - -",

  "Before the act occurs.",
  "And the time limit could have expired before the act occurs. Right? So you get free retaliation after 6 years. Is that right?",
  "No, wait. What kind of an equitable doctrine?",
  "I thought that one of the major things they were concerned about was retaliation against witnesses in the qui tam action, and that will always occur after. I mean, the -- the suit for retaliation will then always occur after the qui tam action.",
  "You're now saying majority, not vast majority.",
  "Well, wait for the SG.",
  "So you're reading alleged into -- into (b)(1). Right? Sure, it will always be based on an alleged violation. So it doesn't have to be a violation.",
  "What he's saying is it should be read to include only those causes of action under 3730 that the rest of (b) makes sense as applied to, just as in (c) the phrase, brought under section 3730, should be interpreted to -- to include only those causes of action that the rest of that provision applies to, namely, those -- those actions under 3730 that involve the United States. I mean, that's -- that's a perfectly reasonable - -",
  "You think -- do you think Congress is more likely to amend 3731(b) to say clearly and non-sloppily what it means if we find for the Government here or if we find for the -- I mean, for - - for the side that the Government supports or if we find for the other side?",
  "What -- what about this as a general -- as a general principle of construction? A court should not, unless there is no reasonable alternative, construe a statute of limitations provision in such fashion that the statute can expire before the cause of action arises?",
  "Is that a reasonable proposition?",
  "No?",
  "It seems to me reasonable to me.",
  "But we don't run forward to create situations like that, do we?",
  "My -- my point isn't that it couldn't exist. I just said you should not interpret a statute of limitations if it is reasonably possible to avoid it in that fashion.",
  "Can I ask you - -",
  "Can I ask you another textual question? You -- you want us to say that (b)(1) must apply to all civil actions under section 3730. Must (b)(2) apply to all civil actions under 3730 as well?",
  "So that -- that could exclude even a retaliation action by an individual who -- who doesn't -- who doesn't know when the -- when the individual -- the official of the United States found out about those facts. That -- that doesn't seem to me very reasonable.",
  "That provision is very -- very reasonable as applied to qui tam actions. It doesn't seem to me to make any sense as applied to a retaliation action.",
  "It might be, but maybe the United States found out before -- before that individual came forward. Maybe there was an official in the United States.",
  "And so he's -- you know, he's -- he's out of -- out of time before he even knows about it.",
  "Strange.",
  "No, but it -- but it would mean that just as 3731(b)(2) can be selectively applied to some categories and not to others, so also, by parity of reasoning, (b)(1) can selectively be applied to some categories of violation and not to others.",

  "Why didn't he waive the right to have counsel for that -- for that purpose since that was the law in Michigan?",
  "Well, he was told what -- what right to counsel he would have and it didn't include this.",
  "Right.",
  "These are all disparate impact arguments. There's -- there's -- you're not making any argument that the State intentionally discriminates against the poor. You're just saying the effect of this is harder on the poor than it is on the rich. But I thought our -- our equal protection cases have -- have said that disparate impact doesn't -- doesn't hack it as far as equal protection is concerned.",
  "Whenever a State has -- has initially given a broad benefit to the poor, whenever it cuts back on poor -- on part of that benefit, it is denying equal protection to the poor? That -- that seems to be an extraordinary proposition. The State isn't picking on the poor. It's just saying that -- that the - - the free counsel we have agreed to provide in the past we're no longer going to provide in this -- in this one instance of guilty pleas. And -- and you say that -- that is intentional discrimination against the poor?",
  "So any cutback on benefits that is given -- on benefits that are given to the poor is intentional discrimination against the poor.",
  "Just this one because that's your case.",
  "So you're -- you're retracting the pure equal protection claim? I don't think you want to do that. I mean, you would say that even if there were not a due process right, you would still regard this as - - as directed against the poor.",
  "Or not?",
  "But you say that component wouldn't exist unless you begin with a due process right to have counsel on appeal.",
  "But, Mr. Moran, if -- if you're -- if you're tying your equal protection claim to a due process claim and if it is not a violation of due process to require people to waive their -- I mean, you can waive entirely the right to appeal. Surely you can waive the right to counsel on appeal. If that's not a violation of due process, then your equal protection claim dissolves.",
  "That's an equal protection claim.",
  "But you've -- you've said your equal protection claim hinges on the due process claim. If the due process claim, in turn, hinges upon waiver, then apart from the -- from the dispute in this case as to whether waiver occurred or not, if waiver does occur, there's no due process claim, and then there's no equal protection claim.",
  "It's their argument anyway. Let them - -",
  "Oh, but -- but that happens all the time. I mean, the waiver -- waiver of appeal in -- in guilty -- in guilty pleas. That's -- that's not permissible either?",
  "Well, you have to if you're going to make the argument you just made.",
  "That's a strange terminology. It doesn't provide a right to appeal. It -- it provides a right to apply for an appeal, a right to ask for an appeal. A right to ask for an appeal is not a right to get an appeal.",
  "So you have an absolute right to ask for an appeal.",
  "But that's not a right to appeal. It's a right to request an appeal, which can be granted or denied.",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, it's done more than change the method. It's changed the entitlement. The court can simply say we're not interested in your appeal. It doesn't raise a significant legal issue.",
  "Didn't -- didn't the supreme court in the Bulger case -- was that the name of it?",
  "Didn't it say that the -- that the intermediate court's denial of -- of appeals was a discretionary judgment?",
  "That was a dissent, though.",
  "This means, I would presume, that -- that we would -- we would have to give -- our Federal courts on habeas would have to give deference to all decisions of the intermediate court since they're all on the merits.",
  "Federal courts do?",
  "They assume that all factual and legal arguments have been decided against the -- the person applying for a discretionary appeal?",
  "But he had an appeal of right until he pleaded guilty.",
  "And that's where -- that's what the waiver consists of. To say he didn't have an appeal of right, no. That's -- he had an appeal of right up until the point where he pleads guilty, and that's what - - and that's what the judge is asking.",
  "Do you want to -- do you want to plead guilty, even though if you plead guilty, you'll get -- you'll get a lawyer only under these circumstances.",
  "The court didn't say only - -",
  "That's the problem.",
  "Of course, your case is a little stronger than -- than the court just asked -- just saying I must appoint counsel in this circumstance and I must appoint counsel in another circumstance. That might have left open the implication that you could appoint counsel in other circumstances, but the court went on and to say I might appoint counsel in this circumstance and I might appoint counsel in the other circumstance. So if there's any implication from it, the implication is not just that I have -- I have listed all the areas in which I must, but it's also I have listed all the areas in which I either must or even may, if there's an implication.",
  "Could I ask about grounds presented before we get off this? Is it conceivable that the lack of merit in the grounds presented means lack of merit in the -- in the grounds of application? Is -- is the applicant required to state why this particular appeal is worthy of being entertained?",
  "And they have said the same, you tell us, as to Federal courts.",
  "I mean, that's another court, and -- and they are not asserting that they've decided on the merits in Federal court.",
  "I'm not talking about what the Federal courts have said. I'm talking about what -- what Michigan has said and -- and what the court of -- has the court of appeals spoken on that subject?",
  "Competent paid counsel.",
  "You can have two appeals of right - -",
  "-- I suppose if you wanted to.",
  "Well, we accept cert before we do that. I thought the question was that the denial of an application for appeal does not have any merits consequence. Wasn't that the question?",
  "Does the denial of an application for appeal have any merits consequence?",
  "If it's always on the merits, it's an -- it's an appeal of right, it seems to me. How can you have a -- a discretionary appeal which always decides the merits of the case?",
  "What's the effect of the constitutional provision then?",
  "If that's so, what is the effect of the constitutional provision that Mr. Schaerr read?",
  "I -- I -- you -- you have the wrong one. I meant the one that said that applications to the court of appeals are -- are -- require leave to appeal. What's the effect of that?",
  "Yes. It says that for the court of appeals, you need leave to appeal. I thought they were doing something there. What were they doing?",
  "It's pretty flabby.",
  "It's pretty flabby. Potentially meritorious? Not probably, potentially.",
  "Of course, it also -- I mean, you say it -- it favors the in-state -- intrastate carrier because if you're doing nothing but intrastate carriage, you -- you amortize the $100 over many more miles, whereas the interstate carrier, much of whose business is out-of - state, doesn't do that. On the other hand, you can certainly argue that -- that this tax discriminates against intrastate carriers in -- in another respect, that is to say, interstate carriers who -- who do nothing within the State do not pay it, whereas the -- the Michigan carrier that does a lot of interstate business but if he does one piece of intrastate business -- interstate business, he still pays it. Isn't that right?",
  "Well, it seems to me you should have introduced some evidence on that point. I mean, it -- it really is an assumption of your unfairness argument that purely intrastate carriers do significantly more intrastate business than interstate carriers who choose to do some interstate business. Now, does that strike you as self-evident? It does not need any - -",
  "-- demonstration?",
  "No, I don't think he -- I didn't - -",
  "I don't understand your answer. If you were finished, I don't understand.",
  "But that -- that assumes it's an SSRS charge, and the State denies that it -- it has anything to do with SSRS. Don't you have to establish that it's part of the SSRS program?",
  "Maybe they sought to but maybe they didn't succeed. As I read the statute, it -- it really applies to the -- the limitation of $10 only to those fees that are SSRS fees, and these are not. So maybe there's -- there's a hole in the Federal statute.",
  "You're trying to make the Federal statute work sensibly, but - -",
  "-- I hate to tell you, but not all statutes work sensibly.",
  "It sure does make sense to me, though. Surely it's the case that a company that does nothing but intrastate Michigan business will, by and large, log in many more miles intrastate than a company which does interstate business but part of its business is intrastate Michigan business. I -- I just -- it seems to me obvious that - -",
  "It -- it's the case that a company that does only intrastate Michigan business logs all of its miles on -- in Michigan. Right? No miles outside of Michigan.",
  "And it seems to me it's obvious that a -- a company that does interstate business does not log all of its miles in -- in Michigan, and likely - - likely -- very likely does -- does less miles in Michigan than -- than a purely intrastate Michigan trucker.",
  "You -- you defend that position, that -- that it doesn't violate the Commerce Clause so long as it's a fee not a tax?",
  "Whenever it's a fee, not a tax, you immediately go to Pike Church.",
  "I know. I know that's what they said.",
  "I found it very strange.",
  "You could say the same about a tax. You could say, you know, you only have to pay this tax if you operate in Michigan. You don't want to operate; you don't have to pay it. And you could also say unless you pay the tax, you cannot operate in Michigan. Does that make it a tax or a fee?",
  "But the American Trucking Association is -- is willing to be thrown into the -- into the briar bush apparently. It certainly involves no -- no difficulty for your Michigan intrastate truckers. All of their miles are intrastate. And the plaintiffs here say we're -- we're willing to -- you know, to provide figures showing how much of our carriage was -- was exclusively intrastate if you want to apportion.",
  "Well, I suppose that's the same thing for the $10 fee for the whatever the acronym is there. That's paid at the beginning of the year, isn't it? And it has to be apportioned among the States. And you don't know how to apportion it at the beginning of the year.",
  "Right, right. But I'm saying the same problem arises when you do any apportioning.",
  "It's like a 3-day fishing license.",
  "Is that right? Let me -- let me -- I wanted to ask this question to see whether it's vehicle-specific. Suppose I have nine trucks. They're Michigan-plated, so I have to pay $100 for each of the nine.",
  "Now, suppose I -- suppose I only pay the fee for eight of them. What happens?",
  "No. I've paid for eight, but I haven't paid for the ninth. As I read the Michigan law, it says shall not operate any motor vehicle upon or over the highways of this State while any of the fees imposed by this act remain unpaid. Now, if -- if I can't operate the other eight because I haven't paid for the nine, that sounds to me like a vehicle-specific tax.",
  "I mean -- I mean the opposite. It's -- it's not vehicle-specific.",
  "I've paid for the eight, and I can't operate at all because I haven't paid for the ninth.",
  "It seems to me how it reads. Am I reading the law wrong? It says, shall not operate any motor vehicle while any of the fees imposed by this act remain unpaid.",
  "At all. So it's not really vehicle-specific.",
  "So it's carrier-based.",
  "That seems to me really to go back on -- on Scheiner. And I thought we tried to get away from deciding Commerce Clause questions on the basis of whether it is interstate commerce or local commerce, you know, the original package doctrine and things that succeeded it. And you're -- you're just dragging back in this -- this inquiry into whether it's really interstate or -- or rather local.",
  "Yes, it could. I mean, if - - if this -- this truck is making one -- one haul, it's carrying some goods from Texas to -- to Maine, but some other goods it picks up along the way within Tennessee and just carries it to another place within Tennessee, and then it picks some other goods in New Jersey, carries it elsewhere to New Jersey, you're going to be taxed. It seems to me it's -- it's one trip. We never used to -- used to divide railroads on the basis of well, the ICC has jurisdiction over just the interstate portions and -- and the two stops within a State can be regulated by the State.",
  "I'd like to know the text you rely on.",
  "For -- for preemption, the text of the current statute that you rely on.",
  "13501 deals just with SSRS.",
  "Where does it say that? Let - - let me come back to the -- to the section of the statute you're quoting. You didn't finish the sentence. It says that it's not an unreasonable burden when the State registration is completed under standards of the Secretary under subsection (c). Subsection (c) is entitled SSRS, Single State Registration System.",
  "Well, you -- you would make the same argument to that that -- that you were making earlier, I assume, that to read it that way would -- would be to nullify Calderon.",
  "I -- I guess I'm -- I'm not clear about the facts here. Did -- did the court -- did the court comply with (b)? Did it shorten or extend the time? Was there any issuance of a -- of a -- of an order shortening or extending the time, or did the court just ignore the deadline and -- and act later?",
  "So there -- there is nothing from the court that -- that says we -- we shorten or extend the time.",
  "Then I guess that the -- that the conclusion would be, if you read 41(b), that if the court has not shortened the time, the court's mandate must issue 7 calendar days after.",
  "He couldn't have recalled the opinion because of the extraordinary circumstance. My God, I made a mistake. He couldn't recall the opinion, could he?",
  "We don't know that all the circuits have that interpretation.",
  "Has Justice Breyer conducted the kind of investigation he asked you about?",
  "Well, it wouldn't have to suspend the rules for good cause since it has authority to extend the time for issuing the mandate. It can comply with 41(b). So I think the most you can say is that the court, when it's faced with extraordinary circumstances of -- of the sort that could overcome Calderon, should issue and order extending the mandate because, and explaining why, because there's this evidence which, if true, would, you know, produce a miscarriage of justice in this case.",
  "Tell me again. How do you - - you read the rule to say?",
  "Yes.",
  "Calderon requires not just that it might have been additional mitigation, but that the defendant would have been ineligible for the death penalty.",
  "That's how I read the case.",
  "I -- I presume your -- your answer would also be that if it's a good reason for -- for not issuing the mandate, as you're supposed to, it would equivalently be a good reason to recall the mandate. We -- we crossed that bridge in Calderon.",
  "What do you do about -- about the provision not of 41(b) but of 41(d)(2)? There had been a petition for certiorari here, which was denied.",
  "Correct?",
  "And -- and (d)(2)(D) says the court of appeals must issue the mandate immediately when a copy of a Supreme Court order denying the petition for writ of certiorari is filed. That didn't happen.",
  "Don't you think it has to issue an order? The State here, having received a judgment and -- and seemingly a mandate has to issue after the judgment unless there's an order extending the time -- went ahead with proceedings to -- to set the execution, to have the -- the person examined to be sure that he was competent to be executed, going through many stages, and was it proper for this court without -- without ever issuing an order extending the time for the mandate, simply to come back - - what -- 18 months later and say, oh, by the way?",
  "They -- they just do it even when they're delaying it for 18 months in order to reconsider the case? I can understand they're just doing it when -- you know, for clerical or other reasons, it - - it comes out in 10 days or even 2 weeks instead of -- if that's what you're talking about, that I can understand. But here we're talking about a decision for a lengthy delay in order that the court may reconsider the case. I would be astonished if it were regular practice for a court to do something like that without notifying the parties.",
  "What I don't understand is how your argument fits in with -- with the rule that you can't recall the mandate. I mean, you have the same horrific situation. My God, we made a mistake. And we've held you can't recall the mandate unless these very high standards are met. Now, are we going to hang on that technical distinction between not issuing the mandate forever and ever and recalling the mandate? The court -- a court has inherent power to recall a mandate, but we said you will not do it unless these very serious obstacles are -- are eliminated. And it seems to me, just as a court does have power to extend the time for issuance of the mandate, it makes sense to say the same thing. You shouldn't do it unless these very serious obstacles are eliminated.",
  "Yes, but they did grab it back from us. I mean, if what you say is true, we should deny cert in all cases where the mandate hasn't issued or where the only stay for the mandate is pending disposition of - - of cert. We should -- we should put that in our rules. They did snatch it back from us, didn't they? What if we had granted cert?",
  "What if we had granted cert? You -- you say they then could not -- what -- what would happen then?",
  "It wasn't stayed. It just wasn't issued.",
  "So is recall permitted. I mean, courts have inherent right to recall too. I mean, the same - -",
  "-- the same situation existed in -- in Calderon.",
  "Why wouldn't -- but why wouldn't that be read in light of AEDPA as well? I mean, whether it's a common law rule or a rule that -- that's written down, why equally shouldn't they be read in light of AEDPA?",
  "Well, we don't -- we don't have to be that harsh. We can -- I don't think that's the question. I think the question is under what circumstances can you correct the error without having formally acted to extend the time for issuance of the mandate. I think one can draw a distinction between the court just sitting there and doing nothing for a year and a half and -- and then, you know, during which it's reconsidering the case without notice to anybody, and a situation in which a court takes formal action. We're extending the time. We could have a much lower standard for the latter than -- than for the former.",
  "Well, this is -- it's an abuse of discretion standard, and -- and it is certainly reasonable to apply one standard for abuse of discretion where the court has entered an order notifying all parties that it's reconsidering the case and a different standard when it hasn't done that. I don't -- I don't think it has to be spelled out in the rule.",
  "How do you know it's not an affirmative defense?",
  "Well, of course, it has the word \"lawful,\" \"the providing of lawful bona fide legal representation services.\" So, you know, it could be argued that if she violating the other provisions, she's still in violation.",
  "What sentence did he get, by the way?",
  "I assume it also would make \"intimidate,\" and so forth, quite superfluous.",
  "Ms. Mahoney, we -- you know, we all know that what are euphemistically termed \"record- retention programs\" are, in fact, record-destruction programs, and that one of the purposes of the destruction is to eliminate from the files information that private individuals can use for lawsuits and that Government investigators can use for investigations. And there has been nothing unlawful about having such a program, even if one of your purposes is not to leave lying around in the file stuff that can be used against you by either the government or a private individual. So, I would have thought that your argument was very persuasive, except for the fact of 1519. I think that 1519 gives me cause to believe that Congress could, indeed, say, \"You can't have record-retention programs.\" How else do you interpret 1519?",
  "Well, but I -- well, yeah, but --",
  "-- but your argument is, you know, \"It's inconceivable that they would have meant that.\" But, my -- they said it in 1519 --",
  "-- -- in 2002.",
  "Wait a minute --",
  "-- wasn't there another provision in effect that said it doesn't matter whether the -- whether the proceeding is pending? I forget which one it is.",
  "Right.",
  "So you think it's superfluous. 1519, if you win this case, really is just an exercise in futility, because the law already did what 1519 said.",
  "Wherein does it go further?",
  "When can they do it? When can they do it? You didn't allege here that it was in anticipation of any particular proceeding. You say they can't do it once they know that the investigation is on the way. But your theory in this case is that they can't do it, whether they know the investigation is on the way or not. They can't destroy any evidence that might be the subject of an investigation.",
  "What is your theory?",
  "\"A reasonable possibility of an investigation.\"",
  "And you want criminal liability to turn upon that.",
  "Whether or not there is a reasonable possibility of an investigation. You want somebody to go to jail on how a jury decides that question.",
  "Well, it would be prohibited to tell somebody to do it.",
  "But you could do it. The doing of it is perfectly okay.",
  "Doesn't that seem strange to you?",
  "I would suggest that it throws a spotlight on the fact that your theory is wrong. It doesn't --",
  "-- it doesn't make -- it doesn't make any sense to make unlawful the asking of somebody to do something which is, itself, not unlawful, so that the person could do it, but if you asked them to do it, you're guilty, he's not guilty. And that's -- that is weird.",
  "Yes, it was. The training session that you introduced in evidence was precisely that, a general training session for all employees, saying, \"This is our document,\" quote, \"retention policy.\"",
  "He says that occurred before Enron had even gotten a letter.",
  "That meeting.",
  "You say that it would be perfectly okay for this company, or any other one, to destroy their documents. What's bad is telling somebody to destroy the documents.",
  "How about \"knowingly\"?",
  "How about \"knowingly\"? Does that -- does that usually connote knowledge of the illegality?",
  "\"Knowingly corruptly.\"",
  "Mr. Dreeben, would you indulge me to go back to a previous answer you gave? I'm sorry, I didn't quite get it. In responding to Justice Souter's inquiry concerning the word \"knowingly,\" you said the word \"knowingly\" appears later, so that it would be -- it would be reduplicative. What later appearance are you talking about, in 1512(b)?",
  "3(a), right.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "But I don't know how you can avoid that.",
  "\"Whoever knowingly engages in misleading conduct,\" which is later defined as --",
  "Oh, I see. The \"knowingly\" only applies to \"uses intimidation or physical force.\"",
  "I don't think you can -- you can use intimidation unknowingly, any more than you can threaten unknowingly. If they felt it necessary to put \"knowingly\" before \"use intimidation,\" I think they would have felt it necessary to put \"knowingly\" before \"threaten.\" The two terms are just about identical.",
  "What do you think it should have been?",
  "I would have thought that, but we've held otherwise.",
  "Well, we've held that they're -- that the principal activity consists of doffing -­ donning and doffing the clothes required, haven't we?",
  "They felt otherwise.",
  "Not necessarily excluded. It's really noncommittal on the point.",
  "Mr. Phillips, can I call your attention to the text of Section 254(a)? It's in the red brief in the Alvarez case, at App. 1. What it -- what it says is that you don't have to pay overtime compensation or minimum wages for and on account of any of the following activities: (1) \"walking, riding,\" blah, blah, blah. This is (1).",
  "-- for the \"place of performance of the principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform.\"",
  "Right. Okay.",
  "Okay.",
  "(2) \"activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or activities.\" You're trying to sever (1) and (2), when the text itself joins them. The activities referred to in (2) are \"said principal activity or activities.\" The \"said\" refers to the ones that are in (1).",
  "How can we possibly sever (1) and (2) and say that for purposes of one, it means one thing; for purposes of two, it means something else?",
  "You would say that's -­",

  "-- you're exaggerating the effect of that statement.",
  "No, it doesn't.",
  "The only thing specifically included in (a)(1) is walking, riding, or traveling to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or activities. And once you assume that \"principal activity or activities\" includes everything that's integral and essential to principal activities, (a)(1) doesn't cover it.",
  "But why isn't walking from the gate of the -- of the factory to the -- to the place where you're on the assembly line, why isn't that integral and essential to the performing of the activities?",
  "No, no, but if -- once you accept the theory that the principal activity includes those things that are integral, you can say walking from the gate of the plant to the assembly line is part of the principal activity. Now, walking to the gate may not be part of the -- may not be part of the principal activity, but -- I -­",
  "What if -- what if -­",
  "Yes, but why -- if you're talking about efficiency, it may well be that the employees, instead of imposing upon the employer the costs of moving the donning and doffing location closer to the -- to the place where the real work is being done, they might prefer, instead, to get a slight salary increase per hour. But -- and that is -- that is possible, under the petitioner's scheme, because it is left to private negotiation; whereas, what you say is that they must pay for that. They must pay for that walk from the donning and doffing. They cannot negotiate out of it, because if it's in the Fair Labor Standards Act, it is mandatory. So I -- don't talk to us about efficiency. It seems to me that the efficiency arguments are on the other side. Leave it to the private sector. The employers -­ the employees can decide what they care more about.",
  "I thought you would say that the whole principle of, you know, \"Are you engaged to wait, or waiting to be engaged?\" just contradicts the principle that was adopted in Steiner.

  "Right.",
  "Mr. Goldstein, since you display such respect for the agency here -­",
  "-- what do you do about the agency's footnote that flatly contradicts your theory of the case, and which says that the mere fact that donning and doffing may require compensation does not necessarily mean that travel between the clothes changing place and the actual place of performance would be excluded?",
  "What if I think that opinion was just flatly wrong, that Congress, when it referred to the \"principal activity or activities,\" was talking about the cutting of the meat or whatever the employer hired the person to do? He didn't hire him to put on clothes. What if I think that? Why do I have to extend what I think to be an erroneous decision beyond its narrow holding?",
  "Why can't I say that Steiner requires that interpretation of what constitutes a \"principal activity\" only for purposes of determining what is compensable, and that when we -- when we come to examine the separate question, of when the workday begins, we can -- we can apply, as far as precedent is concerned, a different interpretation of what is a \"principal activity\"?",
  "Make it up on volume, I think.",
  "Or want to impose a higher tax.",

I can understand you're saying that there is harm done when a statute says, \"The jury shall weigh the aggravating circumstances,\" which are -- have been specified and which are narrowing circumstances; there are only five named in the statute -- \"shall weigh the aggravating circumstances found to be true against the mitigating,\" and it turns out that one of those five aggravating circumstances is unconstitutional. Okay? Then you have the jury weighing something that it shouldn't have weighed, because that aggravating circumstance was bad. I don't see why any harm is done where you have a statute that lists aggravating factors, one of which is \"heinous, atrocious, or cruel,\" and that is later found invalid by the State supreme court. But then, in the weighing process, the jury is told, \"Don't just weigh aggravating factors, weigh all of the circumstances of the crime.\" Now, it seems to me that the same jury that erroneously found, as one of the aggravating factors, \"heinous, atrocious, and cruel,\" would also have found that \"heinousness, atrociousness, and cruelty\" to be one of the circumstances to be weighed. So, what harm is done?",

I find it impossible to believe that the California Supreme Court said not only is the phrase \"heinous, atrocious, and cruel\" too -- you know, too vague for the narrowing factor, but, when you get to the weighing phase, the fact that the murderer sliced up his victim with a thousand cuts of the knife cannot be taken into account by the jury. That's unbelievable.",
  "But the statute does not say \"the finding of any special circumstances found to be true.\" It says \"the existence of any special circumstances found to be true.\" That's what they're -- that's what they're instructed to consider.

However, the United States may be liable, quoting from one of the Ninth Circuit's earlier cases, for the performance of some activities that private persons do not perform when a State or municipal entity would be held liable under the law where the activity occurred. I don't see they are saying, \"We are trying to predict what California would do in a private situation.\" They have set forth a rule that, where there's no cause of action against a private person, we look to whether there would be a cause of action under -- against a State or subdivision of the State.",

  "Of course, you could say the same thing about a voidable contract. You could say, you know, the whole contract is voidable.",
  "I mean, in -- in that respect, a contract that’s void is no different from a contract that’s voidable.",
  "Did the arbitrator --",
  "Could the arbitrator decide that I’m -- I’m going to apply the new statute rather than the old one?",
  "Every usury case, for example. That’s very few? I mean, that’s a lot of cases.",
  "What about fraud in the inducement?",
  "You get rid of them after frustrating the arbitration provision, the whole purpose of which is to keep you out of courts. I’d like to -- I’d like to ask you about your argument on section 2, which --",
  "-- appears at page 3 of the petitioner’s brief. If you want to read it the way you’re reading it, you say a written provision in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce. You say that has to be a -- a contract that is a valid contract. Well, what do you do about the end of section 2 which says, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract? That would apply to -- to contracts that are not -- not void but voidable.",
  "So Southland was wrong.",
  "Why?",
  "Why would you make that -- that weird distinction --",
  "-- and treat the first part of it as though it applies across the board to the entire contract, but the last part of it, reading it differently? I -- I don’t understand that.",
  "It seems to me even if you separate it, you still have the language, save upon such grounds that exist in law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. Unless you take that language, the reference to contract in section 2, as referring to two separate things, the contract without the -- without the arbitration clause and the arbitration clause alone, it seems to me section 2 doesn’t make any sense.",
  "Doesn’t it -- doesn’t it follow from -- from that theory of yours that in every case you are entitled to a judicial determination, not an arbitrator’s determination, but a judicial determination that this was a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce?",
  "Wow. So in every -- every case, the person who -- who is being brought to arbitration can say, I deny that interstate commerce is involved in -- in this -- in this contract and I want to have a -- a judicial determination of it.",
  "Well, I mean, that’s --",
  "The question isn’t whether the court can -- can determine that fact. Ultimately, if the arbitrator determines it incorrectly, you can take it to court. But the question is whether in every arbitration case, you can go immediately to court to have that question of interstate commerce or not determined. And that would really throw a monkey wrench into the whole system, it seems to me.",
  "Once the case is in the court, of course, the court has to decide that question. Once it is in the court. And it was in the court in -- in Prima Paint. The question is does it have to go first to the court before it goes to the arbitrator, and -- and Prima Paint doesn’t decide that question.",
  "Mr. Landau, I’d like to know how you read section 2. What -- what meaning do you give to a written provision in a contract?",
  "I -- I guess that respondent uses the language in the way it -- he says it should be used when he refers to a contract that is void ab initio. There’s no such thing as a contract that is void ab initio, is there?",
  "If you take the meaning of contract that he takes in section 2.",
  "Mr. Pincus, you -- you had a second point you were going -- in response to Justice Breyer's question. What was your second point?",
  "Isn't the refutation of the presumption really the same thing as a demonstration of market power?",
  "And -- and we usually leave the demonstration of market power to the -- to the plaintiff in the case.",
  "So it -- it'd be rather strange to -- to have in this one category of cases the market power has to be -- or lack of market power has to be demonstrated by the defendant.",
  "More often than not, it doesn't.",
  "But the -- the only issue is who has to prove that. I mean, you -- you could find out who their customers are in -- in discovery and -- and go to their customers and then, you know, show that all of the customers are dissatisfied and wouldn't buy -- wouldn't buy the machine -- wouldn't buy the ink were it not that they needed the machine. I mean, it's just a question of -- of who has to prove it. That's all.",
  "We don't know how many people paid -- paid off the plaintiff. We -- you know, frivolous litigation becomes evident only when it proceeds far enough that it's -- it's reported. What -- what I assume would happen most often is that the -- the person who has the patent would just say it's just not worth the litigation. Here. Go away. We don't know how much of that there is.",
  "We're not even sure, are we, Ms. Sullivan, that -- that you can extend, assuming that there is market power in the patent -- we're not really sure that you can extend it through tying. I mean, there's -- there's dispute among the economists even on that question.",
  "You could probably say that in every -- in -- in every antitrust case where -- where the defendant is -- is alleging a -- a monopoly on the part of the plaintiff. It's almost always the case that the plaintiff knows -- knows more about his business than the defendant does. It's not distinctive here, it seems to me.",
  "And you have another point here, don't you, about how general this statute is. We don't normally interpret statutes this way, that they are totally invalid if any application of them would be unconstitutional. That's not what we do with statutes normally, is it?",
  "In the first amendment.",
  "We're talking about a lawsuit which asks for declaration, not that the entire statute is invalid. But that, when faced with an emergency of the sort that this discussion has addressed, the physician can go ahead and perform the abortion?",
  "Quite a different lawsuit from this one.",
  "Do you agree with Justice Breyer that the legislature can draw this with more precision than a court could?",
  "I mean, that seems to be a solution, that the legislature can make it precise, although a court could not.",
  "I thought there was a separate severability. Didn't it have a severability provision?",
  "And so it said just the opposite. It said just the opposite, that if the health exception is no good, the rest of the statute would survive. Isn't that basically -­",
  "Counsel, Surely not the delay for a quick phone call. Let's assume New Hampshire sets up a special office open 24 hours a day and this is the abortion judge, and he can be reached any time anywhere. It takes 30 seconds to place a phone call.",
  "This is really an emergency situation? I guess if that's the case, the doctor better not put on his gloves.",
  "What about in good faith and with substantial support in sound medicine.",
  "I mean, why should the doctor who is very negligent and doesn't know what he's doing, why should he be protected?",
  "It's just one more condition, good faith is not enough. You can have a good faith quack.",
  "I'm sure that's the case with regard to other medical procedures, if you're grossly negligent, it's a criminal offense, I'm sure, in most States.",
  "Then they shouldn't have voted for the severability provision which clearly says if, in one of its applications, it's invalid, the rest can be given effect without the invalid provisions. I mean, the severability provision really just flatly contradicts your assertion that the New Hampshire legislature wouldn't want this to happen.",
  "Excuse me. How could the -- how could the Court of Appeals not have resolved this issue? How could it possibly have rendered its judgment without resolving this issue?",
  "Did you raise this issue below?",
  "Excuse me. Is that how we apply statutes, that if they may plausibly be read a certain way, that's what they mean?",
  "I don't understand how that's a resolution of the question.",
  "I don't understand how they -- how they could dispose of the case without resolving that. That's my puzzlement.",
  "How -- I mean, can we do that in a case that comes up here, and just say, \"There are good arguments on both sides, it's quite plausible,\" and remand the case without resolving the issue?",
  "Except if they think we didn't know what we were doing. I --",
  "-- they ignore it if they -- if they think that we didn't know what we were doing.",
  "He's not talking about the deciding of issues; he's talking about reversing a judgment. You don't have to go into what the issues are in order to follow that instruction. The judgment is reversed. And if there were issues that should have been resolved in order to reverse the judgment, and that weren't, it would seem to me that your remedy would not be to say to the Court of Appeals, \"Well, the Supreme Court didn't mean what it said,\" or, \"didn't know what it was doing,\" but, rather, to move for reconsideration here.",
  "Are you saying you couldn't -- you couldn't file a motion for rehearing on the ground that the Court neglected to address four points that were made very -- you made nothing of them in the -- in the argument or in the briefs. It was almost not considered at all. You mean that when a judgment is issued that is so clearly, in your view, erroneous, you can't come to the Court and say, \"The judgment is erroneous, you forgot to address these issues\"? I hope you can do that in a motion for rehearing.",
  "They would have to say not just that. They would have to say, \"The court did not deal with those four issues, and, therefore, its judgment was erroneous.\" They would have to say that in order to -- in order to act the way they did --",
  "-- because our judgment was \"reverse.\"",
  "Well, you say \"most favorable to its conclusion,\" but did the jury conclude that there should be an injunction?",
  "That's up to the judge.",
  "So, I mean, the principle that you interpret a verdict in the manner most favorable to its conclusion has no application here at all.",
  "Excuse me. You mean it's up -- I don't understand that. The judge, in order to issue the injunction, becomes a second fact-finder, and he can find four -- he can pick four out of the twelve, perhaps four that the jury had not picked?",
  "So, he can -- he can actually make a finding. And it -- and it could be that the jury found that eight of them weren't valid, and the judge, in order to issue an injunction, can contradict the jury and say, \"You know, I find that other four\"?",
  "Let me --",
  "-- let me talk --",
  "-- about the comma. I don't -- I don't -- I don't understand your argument on that point. I mean, it says, \"Whoever, in any way or degree, obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement or any article or commodity in commerce by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires to do so,\" comma -- that's the comma you're talking about?",
  "-- \"or threatens physical violence to any person or property,\" but it continues, \"in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section.\" Now, the only thing that this section has, prior to that statement, said to be a violation is obstructing/delaying by robbery, extortion, or attempt or conspiracy to robbery or extortion.",
  "\"Plan to do anything in violation of this section,\" which is not just obstructing commerce, but obstructing it by robbery, extortion, or attempt or conspiracy to robbery or extortion.",
  "What is -- what meaning do you give to the phrase \"in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section\"? Under your interpretation, you could just drop that -- drop that phrase completely.",
  "But that's not a violation of the section. \"Obstructing interstate commerce\" is not a violation of 1951.",
  "-- is obstructing it by robbery or by extortion or attempt or conspiracy to robbery or extortion.",
  "If you're --",
  "-- convicted --",
  "-- of the crime, but you cannot be indicted as a separate crime. This makes it a separate offense.",
  "You're saying we -- you can use it to aggravate the punishment for some other offense, but this does -- this does something quite beyond that. It says it is a separate offense.",
  "Mr. Chemerinsky, I -- you said earlier that our -- that we \"reversed and remanded.\" That was not in our opinion, though, as it sometimes is, \"Therefore, you know, the case is remanded.\" It doesn't say that. Our opinion here just says \"reversed.\"",
  "It just says --",
  "-- \"reversed.\"",
  "I see. And they interpreted \"reversed\" to mean \"remanded.\"",
  "I see.",
  "I see.",
  "So, that enabled them to say that what we meant was not \"reversed,\" but \"reversed and remanded.\"",
  "They didn't look at the last line of our opinion, which said \"reversed.\"",
  "It's a broad principle. Whenever a Court of Appeals thinks that we haven't really resolved all the issues in the case, they can ignore our order that says \"reversed.\"",
  "We’re not bound by that concession. If that’s a jurisdictional question, doesn’t matter whether the Government conceded it or not, does it?",
  "That’s a different question. Court is not whether, I think, Mr. Whitman can receive constitutional judicial review, but rather, where and how he is supposed to do so.",
  "I still think it’s whether because I don’t agree with the Government. Can I do that?",
  "So that is the question. I mean, the question is open whether there --",
  "But our cases say that where regarded as having been decided.",
  "Even -- even if you assume that Von Raab decided it, you have a quite different situation here. The issue isn’t whether there will be any judicial review. The issue is whether there will be judicial review for the minor grievances, even if they happen to involve a constitutional issue, that are -- that are not -- for which judicial review was not provided. Any major employee action -- judicial review, as I understand it, is available, and it is only relatively insignificant actions for which judicial review is not available. Isn’t that right?",
  "He could have refused -- he could have refused the search, in which case if there was any significant personnel action taken against him for refusing it, he would have had judicial review of whether the search was constitutional or not.",
  "That’s often the case where -- where, in -- in order to challenge a governmental action, you -- you have to be willing to -- to go to court by resisting it.",
  "But that search was a consequence of his employment. It -- this wasn’t a search of a -- of a citizen who had no connection with the Government. It was a search that he was required to submit to as an employee. So to -- to describe it as unrelated to employee action seems to me unrealistic. The only reason he submitted to it was that if he didn’t, he would have -- he would have been subject to an employee action. required, as a condition of his employment, to submit to constitutional drug testing. And his allegation in and --",
  "There is a residual category in the definition of personnel action which says, any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions. That’s the residual category. But one of the specifically named categories, before you get to that, is a decision to order psychiatric testing. Now, if that kind of a decision could be a personnel action, why couldn’t a decision to conduct -- to conduct a drug test be considered a personnel action?",
  "I’m not adding it. There’s a residual category at the end: or any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or a significant change in working conditions.",
  "Why then would a decision to order psychiatric testing qualify? Because it says, or any other. Right?",
  "It’s always good to be safe.",
  "And you -- you agree with the Government on that, that he can never get review of the statutory claim.",
  "Oh, well.",
  "Well, don’t -- don’t appeal to them on a -- on a point on which you don’t agree with them. I mean --",
  "Mr. Stewart, you know, you have here a statute in which Congress, with malice aforethought, very clearly provides for judicial review of any major personnel actions and does not provide for judicial review of what it had regarded as insignificant personnel actions. I can understand the constitutional provision which says Congress can -- can make exceptions to the jurisdiction of the Federal constitutional claims. But when Congress has gone to the trouble of providing for judicial review of any claims that are significant and just saying any other insignificant action, even though a constitutional violation is alleged in connection with it, if in fact it does not harm you that much, we’re not going to allow judicial review, what is -- what is wrong with that? It seems to me that’s what Congress has said and -- and you’re creating a scheme that simply contradicts what Congress plainly said.",
  "Did any of them involve a situation in which Congress took the pain to separate significant actions from insignificant actions?",
  "I mean, some of them involve deportation and, you know, major -- major actions. This is a case where Congress has -- has carefully tried to say these are major actions for which you should be able to get into the courts. And these other things -- you -- you have these administrative remedies, but that’s the end of it.",
  "What’s the second statute? There’s no second statute here. There -- there is your review. That’s what’s driving all of this. And -- and generally speaking, when we find something to be will be constitutional. We just say, you know, there has to be judicial review.",
  "Mr. Stewart, if -- if we’re going to tweak the statute, isn’t the least possible tweak -- and perhaps not a tweak at all -- simply to consider this a personnel action?",
  "If -- if a decision to order psychiatric testing can be one, why can’t a decision to require drug testing be one?",
  "I’m not sure it’s a tweak at all. It -- it just depends on -- on what you consider to be working conditions. And in -- in many contexts, we’ve given the broadest possible interpretation to working conditions.",
  "Well, I --",
  "General, does -- does the judge have to find what the reason for the strike was, or does the judge have to find what the reason for the strike wasn’t?",
  "And if there are several allegations and -- and each of them is somewhat doubtful but, on balance, he says, I give the benefit of the -- of the doubt to the -- to the district attorney, it’s his indication that, as a matter of fact, he finds that the reason wasn’t race.",
  "No. You have to accept his hypothetical as he gave it. Assuming that the attorney, the district attorney, was in good faith.",
  "Yes. Assuming that the -- the attorney did not think that he or she was striking the juror because of the juror’s race.",
  "That -- that gives a lot of power to district -- to -- to the district judge, doesn’t it? I mean, you know, this -- he says this -- this U.S. attorney really doesn’t honestly believe that he’s biased, but I think, being the great psychologist that I am, that this United States attorney, or whoever, is -- is really biased and -- and he’s -- I -- you really --",
  "-- you really want the system to run that way?",
  "There -- there’s no doubt that the court -- or at least in my mind, that -- that the trial court could have come out the other way. I -- I -- you know, all of the things you say are quite true. The question is whether the trial court had to come out the other way, whether it was just utterly unreasonable for the trial court to come out the way it did. And that -- you know, that’s a -- that’s a heavy burden. And -- and it is a messy transcript and all of that, but I -- I find it difficult to see how -- how you can establish that -- not only that -- that the trial court could have come out the other way or, indeed, maybe in your judgment, maybe in my judgment, should have come out the other way. But you have to establish that it’s unreasonable not to come out the other way. And -- and I find it hard to -- to see how you can do that when you have a transcript that relies, in part, upon the -- you know, the rolling of the eyes and the -- and the trial court says, I’m -- I’m willing to give her the benefit of the doubt that that’s the reason she did it.",
  "This prosecutor presumably appears before this judge on other occasions, and -- and don’t you think we -- we can give some weight to the fact that the judge is there, sees the woman, sees what she’s saying, and -- and can judge better than we can whether she’s making this up or just -- just is -- is somewhat confused, especially since, as -- as I think the General pointed out, we’re dealing with a kind of determination that is usually instinctive on the part of trial counsel. There’s just something about this, you know, and you move to strike. I’m not sure it springs into your mind, at the time you -- you move to strike, the precise reason. Then somebody asks you later, why was it? Why was it? There was just something about that person I didn’t like. I know it wasn’t the race. That had nothing to do with it. Now, what was it? And then -- then you have to recreate a -- a rational process that, in fact, never occurred. It was an instinctive process more than a rational one. So I’m -- I’m not particularly upset by -- by seeing counsel flounder about in -- in trying to come up with what the right reason was. I think it’s probably pretty hard to figure out.",
  "I’m saying that it’s hard. That’s all. And -- and that you can understand why somebody would flop around because, at the time the strike is made, I’m -- I’m not sure it’s always an entirely rational rather than instinctive action.",
  "Do you think that (d)(2) or (e)(1) is the -- is the stricter requirement? I’m really not sure which of the two. Don’t you think it -- it might be possible to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that the State court decision was -- factual decision was wrong, but you, nonetheless, do not show that it was unreasonable? In other words, it may well be that (d)(2) is -- is the more severe one.",
  "When you say that it asks what other employers receive, but these institutions, I gather, would not allow other employers, who have the same policy against the hiring of homosexuals, to interview at their institutions. So, you're receiving what other employers in the same situation would receive.",
  "No, but it seems me you've got us off galloping in the wrong direction. The statute doesn't require simply giving the same access that you give to other employers. It requires much more than that. It requires that they -- it prohibits, or cuts off, funds if an institution either prohibits or, in effect, prevents the Secretary of a military department from gaining access to campuses for purposes of military recruiting in a manner that is at least equal in quality and scope to the access to campuses and to students that is provided to any other employer. So, it seems to me that the statute demands more than simply you give the same access as all other employers. If you allow any other employer, you have to give it to the military in the same manner.",
  "What does Title X of the United States Code deal with?",
  "Why do you chose to defend this principally on the basis of the Spending Clause, and not on the basis of what it -- what it was, seemed to me, enacted in order to achieve, and that is the congressional power to raise and support armies.",
  "It happens, in this case, to be specifically authorized by the Constitution.",
  "You cannot convert a law into a law directed at the first -- at first-amendment rights, can you, by simply saying, \"The reason I am disobeying it is to express -- whatever, disaffection with the war, my objection to homosexuality, or anything else -- or to homosexual discrimination -- or anything else\"? Does that convert it to a law directed against the first amendment?",
  "You're not going to be an Army recruiter, are you?",
  "They're worried about having students driven off. And if you have jeering and picketing, do you really think that that fulfills the purposes of this amendment?",
  "Oh, where do you find that? In -- it has to be a morally-based, conscience-driven --",
  "I thought we were talking about freedom of speech, not the religion clauses.",
  "What do you --",
  "What do you do about the -- about the cases where we have required colleges to allow some student activities to put forward their views on campus, when other student activities are allowed to do that? It seems to me that that flatly contradicts the proposition that when you compel an institution to permit somebody else to speak, you are violating that institution's first-amendment rights.",
  "So, you --",
  "-- are saying that --",
  "-- that every time somebody gives as his reason for violating a law that he wants to send a message that he disagrees with that law --",
  "-- that raises a first- amendment question.",
  "Well --",
  "Here's a need. How about this? We have said in our opinions -- and I am quoting from Rostker versus Goldberg -- \"Judicial deference is at its apogee when legislative action under the congressional authority to raise and support armies and make rules and regulations for their governance is challenged.\" And that's precisely what we have here.",
  "I don't think it has to do with expertise. I think it has to do with immense national importance.",
  "Mr. Rosenkranz, could you tell me which elements of your argument rest upon compelled actual speech and which rest upon compelled symbolic speech? Because the latter, I have to tell you, I'm not very fond of. What compelled actual speech is imposed on the -- you mentioned something about e-mails, they have to send e-mails to say where the recruiter will be located --",
  "-- is that the compelled speech you're worried about?",
  "Well, that's symbolic speech. I'm talking about actual speech. What expression is the university -- real, you know, words ­ - words -- is the --",
  "-- university --",
  "-- compelled to utter by this legislation?",
  "No, I suppose when you -- when the police knock at the door and say, you know, \"I have a warrant,\" I suppose somebody has to say, \"Come in.\" Is that compelled speech? Does that --",
  "Does that -- does that raise a first-amendment problem?",
  "Suppose that a law-school faculty could decide that it does not favor a particular war, and use that as the basis for excluding recruiters, \"By allowing this recruiter to come on campus, you are making me speak, in effect, to our students, saying, 'Join the Army and fight the war that we're now engaged in.'\"",
  "\"And I don't want to do that.\" Now --",
  "-- what would be the difference?",
  "Yes, okay --",
  "-- fine. I'm saying the same thing.",
  "But I'm saying --",
  "-- you would say that the same situation would apply if the university faculty does not favor the particular war that the United States is --",
  "-- engaged in, and, therefore, obstructs the effort to raise --",
  "-- an army --",
  "-- by not allowing them to come on campus.",
  "It's obstruction when you refuse to give them what you give what you give everybody else.",

  "So -- it's -- it's brand new to us. We -- we didn't think this was in the case at all.",
  "Excuse me. I -- I thought the question presented -- I didn't think. I'm reading it from the petition for writ of certiorari. In the absence of a contractual relationship with the defendant, are allegations of personal injuries alone sufficient to confer standing on a plaintiff pursuant to 42 U.S.C., section 1981? So, I mean, the question presented was -- was precisely if your client did not have a contractual relationship, would the mere allegation of personal injury, which you're now alleging, be enough to confer standing?",
  "Well, the question is -- I mean, that begs the question, whether there has been a violation of section 1981, and the argument here is that there's no violation of section 1981 unless you're interfering with a contract of the plaintiff.",
  "Which you didn't allege and didn't even raise in the brief in opposition here.",
  "His contract with -- with the corporation?",
  "No.",
  "That's exactly the issue. And --",
  "-- and that's how I understood this came -- case came up here. The contract you're relying on is the contract between the corporation -- between the corporation and Domino's. And can you -- can you sustain a lawsuit for the violation of that contract? There was no mention of any other contract. I don't know why we should send it back down so you can mention a contract that you haven't even thought of even when you filed the brief in opposition. So that's the issue, whether the violation of the contract between McDonald -- between Domino's and your client's corporation will allow your client to get -- to get some damages inasmuch as he was the target. That's how I understood the lawsuit.",
  "Now, could you tell me when -- the -- the claim was settled when your client's corporation was in bankruptcy. Right?",
  "And I assume your client had no -- nothing to say about -- about whether the settlement would be -- would be accepted by the trustee or not.",
  "It was out of his hands, which means that, you know, you're -- you're sort of pleading the advantage of a corporation, limited liability and all of that, and went through bankruptcy taking that advantage, one of the consequences of which was that you left it to the corporation to settle this claim. And now you want to disclaim the advantage of a corporation and say, oh, although the -- you know, the corporation settled it out -- you know, I was no longer in control of it because of the bankruptcy -- I want to bring the claim on my own. I mean, I can understand why it would be nice for you to get that, but it doesn't seem to me that you should be able to play dog in the manger that way. You either -- you either accept the corporate form or you don't.",
  "Well, it was his -- it was his corporation, and until he went bankrupt, any recovery by that corporation would have been a recovery by -- by John McDonald. What -- what created your problem is the fact that -- that the corporation went bankrupt.",
  "But, you know, that's -- that's one of the -- one of the consequences of taking advantage of the corporate form.",
  "But it doesn't -- it doesn't talk about personal injury that -- that broadly. It talks about the right to make and enforce contracts. That's the portion of it you have to be relying upon. It doesn't talk about --",
  "-- personal injury. It's not a --",
  "-- it's not a more generalized tort. If want to call it a tort, it is a tort that goes to your ability to make and enforce contracts. I don't see anything --",
  "-- dignitary about that.",
  "And you're saying it means discrimination that relates to the making and enforcing of a contract with somebody else. And you're saying that since the discrimination was targeted at you, even though the contract was with -- was with somebody else, you have a claim under this language of 1981.",
  "But -- but when you say damages that can be proven, the only damages you -- you insist upon proving is the fact that you were a target and that it -- it insulted you. It -- it was -- you know. That's the only damage you require. So you're saying that every -- every minority employee of all of the companies with whom GM, or whoever it is didn't do business, would automatically have a cause of action.",
  "No. Okay. Well, then -- then what do they have to show? They have to show that -- that their salaries were -- were reduced? But -- but you haven't shown that here. You didn't plead that here. They have to show -- show that a contract with them was breached? But you didn't plead that here and you didn't show it here. So the -- the only thing that -- that you -- you can answer is they would all have causes of action if their -- their honorific values were somehow impugned.",
  "That was -- that was the consequence of the bankruptcy of his corporation. I mean, that didn't -- didn't --",
  "The State has made a judgment that this particular offense -- what's it called? Aggravated murder, you know, whatever --",
  "Capital murder, as its name implies, warrants a judgment of death unless there are mitigating factors that -- which indicate that that is not proper.",
  "That's a moral judgment, isn't it?",
  "And even if the State had said the opposite, it -- it is a -- still a State- prescribed moral judgment. If the State had said capital murder warrants a judgment of death only if the mitigating factors outweigh the aggravating factors, that's still a State-prescribed moral judgment, isn't it?",
  "The Furman -- the -- it's hard to tell where the voice is coming from, I know. We ought to get that fixed.",
  "The Furman narrowing is produced by the very first part of subsection (e). If, by a unanimous vote, the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that one or more of the aggravating circumstances enumerated in -- in section 24-4625 and amendments thereto exist -- that's the Furman.",
  "And then beyond that you say if that is found, then the jury has to find that the existence of such aggravating does not outweigh.",
  "I have no idea what that means. I mean, you -- you go into this very elaborate system, you know, molecules on one side, molecules on the other.",
  "And then you throw the whole thing up in the air and say mercy alone is enough. I mean --",
  "Ms. -- Ms. Woodman, you know, I -- I have not, you know, gone along with -- with most of our Walton jurisprudence anyway, but -- but what I have really always thought it demanded was really nothing more precise than that a jury has to be given the opportunity to grant mercy. I -- I'm not sure I would describe any of it as any more precise than that.",
  "The jury has to be given the opportunity to say this poor devil doesn't deserve the death penalty. However you want to put that, you know, you can put the burdens here, the burdens there. You can talk about equipoise or not. Does the jury have a chance to say this -- this fellow does not deserve the death penalty? That --",
  "-- and clearly exists under this scheme, it seems to me. Any jury that -- that really thinks this person should not go to death can -- can do it. In fact, you know, I guess the statute does not demand that instruction, but that instruction that says -- what is it? The appropriateness of the exercise of mercy can itself be a mitigating factor. I mean, gee, what -- what else -- what else do you have to do?",
  "Any jury that thought this -- this person did not deserve death would have ample opportunity to give expression to that determination under this scheme.",
  "And therefore, they shouldn't consider mitigating at all, he told them?",
  "Is -- is this mercy instruction always given? Is that standard? Is it -- is it, in effect, that -- that mercy is -- is always one of the mitigating circumstances?",
  "Gee, I -- I really don't see what -- what complaint you have then. Any jury that -- that thinks this person deserves mercy says, I think he deserves mercy, and that's -- that's a -- a mitigating circumstance that outweighs whatever aggravating circumstances there are.",
  "If the State is --",
  "Who said that? Excuse me. That -- that description of the statute.",
  "Yes, but it seems to me the statute doesn't really say that, does it? But I mean, what the statute says is that if it's in perfect equipoise, the State loses because the State has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the -- that the mitigators do not outweigh the aggravators. It seems to me if a jury sees them in perfect equipoise, the jury would have to say the State has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigators do not outweigh the aggravators. What -- isn't that what a jury would have to say?",
  "That's right. Okay. And -- and if the jury cannot decide whether the aggravators are outweighed by the mitigators, if they're in perfect equipoise, who loses?",
  "No. The State loses. It's the State that has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that they are --",
  "Well, how could the issue be pressed? I mean, it had already been decided by the supreme court. I mean, what -- what could the State say to the trial court?",
  "You think this -- you think the State has to challenge as unconstitutional a decision of the State supreme court in -- in the lower court, lower State court.",
  "How do you expect the lower State court to come out on that?",
  "That's a little different from an adequate and independent State ground argument. You're -- you're now making a -- a waiver argument.",
  "We -- we don't need a presumption here. I mean, the -- the only basis for inquiring into severability is the presumed unconstitutionality of the statute. I mean, that's the only basis why severability comes up. We don't have to presume anything.",
  "It doesn't matter whether it redecided it. It -- it was the postulate of -- of its -- necessary postulate of -- of its decision in this case, it seems to me.",
  "Kleypas didn't hold that the whole statute was bad. Kleypas gave a savings construction of the statute, as I recall.",
  "So -- so the State can get mouse-trapped in this way. In -- in the first case, it doesn't take the case up because not too much has been lost, and then in the second case, the court says, oh, by the way, everything has been lost. And you say that we can't review that because -- because the -- the State didn't -- didn't challenge Kleypas at the time.",
  "Well, but that decision in this -- they had no reason to challenge it until the State decided to -- to change it.",
  "I like that.",
  "Ms. Williams, I don't -- I don't understand all of this discussion about what the -- whether the State law would have produced the same result, or not. We have never held, have we, that, where a State Supreme Court opinion clearly rests on a Federal ground, a Federal constitutional ground, we do not have jurisdiction if there is a possible State ground that would have left it -- led to the same result? Have we ever held that?",
  "And we've said just the opposite, haven't we?",
  "I suppose that if that provision weren't there, the court would have to decide, item-of-evidence by item-of-evidence, which pieces, that the jury has already heard, were relevant to the penalty, and not to the guilt. Whereas, by just allowing everything in, but just telling the jury, \"You only consider it insofar as it goes to the penalty, and not to the guilt,\" we -- the court does not have to enter into that item-by-item discrimination.",
  "That isn't the basis on which the court decided this case, is it?",
  "What we're saying here is that this is a possible basis on which the Oregon Supreme Court might have decided this case. They did not decide it on that case -- on that ground. They decided that the jury has to be able to consider doubt, not because of that provision of the statute, but because of the eighth amendment. And --",
  "And --",
  "What has our constitutional law regarding the requirement of allowing the jury to consider all mitigating factors -- the requirement that they have to be allowed to be take into account of that -- what guidance has that provided? Has our constitutional law said what constitutes a mitigating factor?",
  "Apart from that, apart from the fact of whether the person's guilty or not, have we specified what factors the jury can take into account by way of mitigation?",
  "Don't you think that if a State listed specific factors that could be taken into account, and no others, that there would be considerable doubt whether this Court would allow such a statute to stand?",
  "When you --",
  "So, you think -- you think the Oregon Supreme Court might well come out that way, if it wished, although not resting on the eighth amendment?",
  "Yes.",
  "So, if we vacate it and the case is remanded on that ground, I assume it's still open for you to point out to the Oregon Supreme Court that they were in error about the -- about the status of the testimony that you tried to get in, and have it admitted on that ground. Why isn't that the way to handle the matter, rather than your --",
  "-- as you express it, \"mooting the case\"?",
  "Of course, that -- there would still remain -- whether you mooted the case, or whether we vacated and then it was left to the Oregon Supreme Court whether to let this evidence in -- there would still remain the question of what kind of an instruction the jury can be given regarding the consideration of this evidence for purposes not of determining whether a guilty person should not be given the death penalty, but, rather, for purpose of considering whether the guilt is clear enough. I mean, that's -- that issue would still remain, wouldn't it?",
  "Why wouldn't it?",
  "No, I understand, but what are you -- what are you going to argue to that jury? Are you going to argue to that jury, you know, that, \"Yes, my client has been convicted, but the evidence of his guilt was really not all that clear, and you should take that into\" -- don't you want to make that argument?",
  "And the Oregon Supreme Court says you can make that argument, because the eighth amendment requires you to be able to make that argument.",
  "And what the State says is, \"No, the eighth amendment requires no such thing.\" So, the issue hasn't gone away. It's still here. It's here in this very case.",
  "What the --",
  "No, no, no. You're entitled to get the evidence in, under Oregon law, but the question of how that evidence can properly be used by the jury has been decided by the Oregon Supreme Court only on the basis of the eighth amendment, not on the basis of any Oregon statute.",
  "In the penalty phase.",
  "In the penalty phase?",
  "Hasn't that already been found in the guilt phase?",
  "You --",
  "You can be found guilty of murder when you didn't intend to kill?",
  "That seems to be very strange, because I think our cases require -- require that for death eligibility, and --",
  "I would pass, if I were you.",
  "They used to have --",
  "-- two trials. I mean, you know, that's the whole problem here. Your client has been tried as to whether he committed the offense, and found guilty, and now you --",
  "-- now you want to relitigate the same matter. I don't --",
  "I don't --",
  "And on the basis that the Constitution requires you to be able to relitigate the same matter two times in the same criminal proceeding, that doesn't seem, to me, right.",
  "I thought -- well, I guess it -- I guess it depends on what you mean by an \"alibi.\" If all you mean by an \"alibi\" is that, for part of the offense, he was somewhere -- I thought an alibi meant, \"I am not guilty, because I was not there.\" That's what I thought an alibi was --",
  "General Williams, I have one question. I'm not sure it goes to our eighth amendment question before us, but I honestly don't understand what your statute is all about. It says that after having been convicted of aggravated murder -- aggravated murder -- the sentencing jury shall be presented with the following questions. Number one, whether the conduct of the defendant that caused the death of the deceased was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that death of the deceased, or another, would result. Don't you have to find that in order to convict of aggravated murder?",
  "Plus, okay.",
  "-- I gotcha.",
  "I don't know, I'd be worried -- you know, bust in somebody's door -- that the homeowner wouldn't shoot me. Without announcing that I'm the police, he had every reason to believe he's under attack. Isn't that a considerable deterrent?",
  "Exactly.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes.",
  "I'm not sure I agree with a point that you make in your brief that civil actions simply are of no use. That might have been the case when we first adopted the exclusionary rule, but our docket is crowded with 1983 cases brought by prisoners, brought by convicted felons, and many of these cases are successful below. What reason is there to believe that that wouldn't be an adequate deterrent?",
  "Of course, that same problem exists if the consequence is exclusion of evidence. Courts are going to view it the same way. You're not going to avoid that problem by excluding evidence.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, I mean, your point is, it's very hard to tell whether they waited long enough, right? And that's why they don't win a lot of these cases. But the same thing is going to be true if the consequence of not waiting long enough is the exclusion of the evidence. The court is going to be very -- it's going to be very difficult to tell if they waited long enough, and, as you say, the court is likely to say, you know, \"Let it go.\"",
  "Our two cases did not -- did not raise that issue. The issue was not decided in those cases, was it?",
  "Right.",
  "Yes, but here it was a warrant to enter the home, not to seize particular goods. So, the entry of the home was not illegal. The entering of the home was perfectly okay. What was illegal was not knocking and announcing in advance. It seems to me that's quite a different -- quite a different issue, and the causality is quite different.",
  "I understand that, but the essence of the violation was not the entering; whereas, in the cases, the old common law cases you're talking about, the essence of the violation was the entering. Here, the entering was perfectly okay; it was the manner of it, the failure to give the advance notice, that made it bad. And that, it seems to me, creates a different situation.",
  "Mr. Moran, these old common law cases you referred to, which held that a failure to knock and announce renders the entry unlawful, what was the consequence, in those cases?",
  "Right. And the evidence would -- if found, was not excluded, right?",
  "So, if we wanted to be faithful to those common law cases, we wouldn't exclude the evidence.",
  "Well, then you shouldn't have cited the common law case.",
  "Well, I suppose there are a lot of other violations of constitutional rights by the police that are very hard to get at, and that cannot be remedied. And I suppose we could punish them by excluding all the evidence, as well. We don't do so, simply because there's no causality. We insist upon a causal connection between the two. It's not enough just to say the -- this is the only way to stop the police from making the violation.",
  "What about our opinion in Ramirez, where the manner of entry was such that there was damage to property?",
  "We didn't exclude the evidence there, did we?",
  "Well, what had happened? Had they broken a window on the way in? Is that --",
  "Well, the entry remains lawful, despite the fact that the manner of the entry, which included the breaking of a window, was unlawful. I think what the Court meant was not, as you're portraying it, that, objectively, the entry was lawful. I think they were speaking: as a matter of law, despite the fact that the breaking of the window was wrong, the entry was lawful. Just as your opponent is saying here: despite the fact that there was no knock-and-announce, the entry was lawful.",
  "So, you -- so, you think it's possible that the defendant could argue that the evidence should be excluded because, \"Had he knocked and announced, I would have run to the toilet and flushed it down, rather than\" --",
  "-- \"answering the\" --",
  "Well, why not?",
  "That's causal.",
  "I thought the Government's distinction was based on the fact that they were arrest cases. I thought that's the distinction they were making.",
  "But you're willing to acknowledge -- and -- and the Government concedes that you can have a different standard when the -- the basis for the selective prosecution happens to violate the Constitution from the standard you apply where the basis for the selective prosecution doesn't violate the Constitution, such as I'm prosecuting him because he was mean to my brother-in-law. Okay?",
  "Are you going to apply a different standard there than you would apply where -- where the reason is some First Amendment reason?",
  "But would you answer my question?",
  "It's going be a different criterion -- you -- you say it's going to be different for the First Amendment and the -- and -- and the Equal Protection Clause, at least where race is involved. What if there's no constitutional violation at all, but I just selectively prosecute him just because I don't like this guy or because he was mean to a relative of mine?",
  "Is there going to be a different standard --",
  "Exactly, and would you apply a different standard because there isn't a constitutional claim?",
  "That's what I'm asking.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, the defendant here is not the prosecutor. Right?",
  "Just someone who provided information to the prosecutor that -- that was erroneous and allegedly maliciously motivated.",
  "Allegedly maliciously motivated, at least. I don't understand how you would apply the test, would -- you know, would you have prosecuted anyway, when -- you know, but for the malicious motive, when the person you're -- you're suing is not the prosecutor. It wasn't up to this person whether there would be a prosecution.",
  "Mr. McCartan, how does -- how does your standard work? The same question I asked Mr. Kneedler. The -- the test you would propose is whether but for the retaliatory motive, the prosecution would have been brought anyway?",
  "Right.",
  "No. I think they would say absolute immunity, not qualified. I -- I think they're saying if there's probable cause, the game is over. No -- no qualified --",
  "This wasn't addressing -- this wasn't -- didn't involve prosecution, though. It didn't involve unlawful prosecution.",
  "It -- it was a suit against a prison.",
  "No, but -- but we treat prosecutions quite differently. We do not give, for example, absolute immunity to the wardens of prisons as we give absolute immunity to prosecutors.",
  "This is a specially dangerous area in which to allow litigation.",
  "Mr. McCartan, I -- I still don't entirely understand what you would want the Government to prove under your system in order to -- in order to -- to win this case. They would have to prove what? That -- that --",
  "And it would not be enough to show that the prosecution would have gone forward anyway.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "You see now in -- in the employment cases where -- where somebody is dismissed for a -- a racially discriminatory reason and -- and you have to prove that the same action would have been taken anyway, you ask the person who fired them with the discriminatory motive whether that person would have taken that action anyway. Whereas here, the person who brought the prosecution is not in this case. It's somebody who gave information to the prosecutor. I don't know how that person could -- could possibly establish that the prosecution would have been brought anyway. It wasn't up to him.",
  "It had nothing to do with --",
  "Do you think the defendant can subpoena the prosecutor?",
  "Why? I thought the prosecutor had absolute immunity.",
  "You say he -- he can't be brought into court to defend his own -- his own judgment, but he can be brought into court when -- when an investigator is sued in -- in order to take his testimony as to what would have happened?",
  "Well, he may have done it voluntarily here, but I find it hard to believe that he could be subpoenaed, when -- when he has absolute immunity from suit against himself, to testify in a suit against somebody else. It seems to me a very strange kind of a --",
  "Well -- well, surely the prosecution --",
  "Surely the prosecution would go ahead if there were probable cause. No? No? I mean, suppose it was brought up during the prosecution.",
  "You mean to say if there was -- if there was perfect probable cause for the prosecution, that you can stop the prosecution in its tracks by -- by an allegation of the First Amendment violation?",
  "Mr. McCartan, what was the 1887 case or 1880 --",
  "I thought you said Armstrong.",
  "I thought it was --",
  "Right, because the prosecutor could have gotten a lot of other information from other people.",
  "And you're not going to throw out the prosecution just because this one piece of information was bad.",
  "Neither -- neither does absolute immunity for the prosecutor distinguish between whether the prosecutor was acting just illegally or just acting unconstitutionally. I mean, yes.",
  "You apply the same rule there.",
  "Yes, well, your -- your point that -- that there -- there has to be a difference between whether there's a constitutional violation or not in this context seems to me not well taken because we don't make that distinction in the context of giving absolute immunity to the prosecutor. We don't say he doesn't have absolute immunity when -- when he's been guilty of a constitutional violation.",
  "I wouldn't worry a lot about that, Mr. --",
  "Well, do you acknowledge that the rule of reason analysis of the -- of the initial formation can include a rule of reason analysis of whether it -- it would violate the -- the Sherman Act to -- to have the new entity price both products the same?",
  "You could say you -- you just never get beyond step one. You don't go any further if there's no market power.",
  "I don't -- I don't really -- who -- who would set the price if it was not -- if it was not the joint venture?",
  "The joint venture owns the gasoline. Okay? And it owns the gas stations, those that aren't independent stations. And somebody else is going to set the price for the gas that the joint venture owns? Wouldn't you need some separate agreement that clearly sets that forth?",
  "It's the board of directors. Isn't it? Isn't the members committee the board of directors of -- of the joint venture?",
  "That's because it's a joint venture.",
  "That's the nature of a joint venture. The board of directors is composed of people representing the various elements of the joint venture.",
  "There's nothing subversive about that.",
  "Yes, but that's because the joint venture did not include -- did not include a merging of the product as it did here. Here, the gasoline from both of them was merged into one gasoline, which was sold and the profit of which was divided between them. In -- in Citizens Publishing, each of the newspapers continued to sell its own newspaper and to -- and to reap whatever profit it could make from its own newspaper. That's fundamentally different from here. There -- there still is competition between the two newspapers.",
  "But they were competitors. They were -- each one of them sold its own newspaper. All they merged was -- was their publishing facilities. And when they agreed separately not to -- to charge the same price for the newspaper, that was not part of the joint venture. That was, indeed, an agreement between competitors. There were two separate newspapers selling on the basis of their own distribution system and so forth.",
  "Of course --",
  "-- they're not able to fix the price unless they have market dominance. I mean, do you think they're just competing with each other? Aren't there other companies selling gasoline?",
  "And I don't think that this -- this joint venture would have been allowed if -- if these two companies together dominated the market. Of course, it wouldn't have been allowed.",
  "You mean fix prices successfully.",
  "Fix -- fix prices and not be an idiot at the same time.",
  "You don't -- you don't want them to present it to a jury, as I understand it.",
  "You don't want them to present it to a jury. The whole reason that you're here is that you want us to declare a per se violation. You -- you want to put it to a jury?",
  "Mr. Alioto --",
  "Who -- who is it that you would have had the price set by?",
  "I mean, it's their gas. Okay? They're marketing it through their stations. Who -- who would have set the price if -- if we said it's -- it's bad for Equilon to do it?",
  "Gave whom independence? Gave whom --",
  "They did give them independence.",
  "That is --",
  "They gave their board of directors independence. Now, the board of directors was composed, as -- as boards of directors of joint ventures are, by the parties to the joint ventures.",
  "Who -- have you answered my question? Who would you have wanted to set the price in this case?",
  "But I think they did say the former. You -- you make the price decisions. Equilon.",
  "Your -- your complaint is that Equilon is in reality a joint venture of -- of the two -- the two gasoline companies.",
  "That's your complaint.",
  "The district court heard that, though, didn't it?",
  "And didn't believe it. Right? And did not believe it. Found as a matter of fact that the blood was -- was not a result of the spill.",
  "That -- is that a conclusion of law?",
  "I don't care what part it put it in. The district court did not believe that the blood on the trousers was a consequence of the spill and that -- and that, therefore, blood was identified on the inside of his trousers that was the blood of the victim. That's what the district court believed, having heard the testimony.",
  "On that point -- on that one point, do you contend that the district court was clearly erroneous?",
  "On that one point of the blood, of whether, indeed, his blood was on -- or the victim's blood was on the inside of his trousers? On that one point, do you claim that the district court was clearly erroneous?",
  "What's your -- what's your second point? Because I --",
  "On the basis solely of the testimony of -- of this expert.",
  "Including the contrary testimony that said if it had been the result of a spill, it would not have been splattered all over, as it was here. Some of it wouldn't have been on the inside of the trousers. Some of it wouldn't have been mixed with mud. Despite all of that, you -- you can say that the district court's finding, which I consider a finding of fact, was clearly erroneous.",
  "Excuse me. I -- I agree that all of this stuff would -- would have made a better case for the defendant here. But once the case has been tried and both sides have put on all the evidence they have, we have a -- a much different test, and -- and that is whether any reasonable juror could have found him guilty. That's a very heavy burden: whether any reasonable jury could have found guilt. I agree it would have been a much closer case, but -- but the burden you -- you have before us here is to establish that no reasonable jury could possibly have found him guilty.",
  "And on -- just on the blood thing alone, I -- I find that a hard burden to bear.",
  "And it also contained the testimony of an expert who said that if the tube spilled in that way, it would not have created the kind of spatterings that -- that were incriminating in this case. Even if there was some spill, it would not have produced the kind of spattering. So, you know, I call that a draw.",
  "That -- that would be an important point if, in fact, it conclusively established that the blood was not the blood of the victim, but I don't think it does conclusively establish that, and if it doesn't, the -- the less than perfect performance of counsel is -- is no basis for setting aside the conviction.",
  "Right. And -- and the point of controversy is whether a spill of -- of the -- of the blood in -- in the course of transport could have produced this -- this kind of -- of spattering, including a spattering on the inside of -- of the trousers near the button. It -- it seems to me unlikely, and -- and I am unable to say that no reasonable jury -- juror could not think it unlikely.",
  "It's much more than that.",
  "Oh, but surely he's supposed to make factual determinations. We -- I -- I don't want to make factual determinations on all these questions. That's -- that's not our system of law. Those factual determinations are made by the trial judge. And here, I agree with you that we don't have to accept his judgment as to what a reasonable juror would have done, but I do think that we have to accept his factual findings as accurate unless they're clearly erroneous. And here, he made the factual finding that that blood was there before the transport. And I -- I think I'm bound by that unless you can show that it is clearly erroneous, which I don't think you can.",
  "But -- but the -- the injuries on the body are simply not consonant with -- with that manner of her -- of her death. A police officer testified not only to a head injury, but to blood coming out of the nose and ears, scratches and bruises on her throat and legs, scratches on her face. That simply is not consonant with one whack on the head.",
  "Well, Schlup shouldn't -- shouldn't have expressed it that way then. Schlup must have -- must have made a big mistake when it said no reasonable juror could. It should have expressed it differently and said a reasonable juror would not -- would not have found, but they didn't say that. It said no reasonable juror.",
  "Or more precisely, what would all reasonable jurors have done.",
  "All reasonable jurors.",
  "It's Agent Bigbee. I'm getting confused.",
  "The district court heard all of this, didn't it, all this evidence, and -- and didn't the district court make a factual finding?",
  "I mean, we -- we can call in these witnesses ourselves, I suppose, and hear them all again, but we usually accept the factual findings of the trier of fact.",
  "Ms. Smith, could -- could you go on to some of the other elements that are contested here? In particular, I'm interested in -- in Mr. Muncey's confession. What -- what do you -- what do you say about that?",
  "Justice Breyer has not heard these witnesses and hasn't had the opportunity to know whether -- whether, for example, these -- this testimony about the confession was credible or not.",
  "And the hearer of -- at the trial did have that opportunity.",
  "There is evidence of rape besides -- besides the semen. The semen wasn't the only evidence of rape, was it?",
  "There were scratches on the thighs.",
  "What's the practical consequence of the one or the other? Number one, if you don't raise it below, you can still raise it on appeal if it's jurisdictional. Right?",
  "And number two, the -- if it's a jurisdictional question, it would be decided by the -- by the judge rather than by the jury?",
  "But that's always the case. I mean, why -- you know, if those disadvantages -- those disadvantages will always exist. So why would Congress ever make something jurisdictional rather than simply making it an element of the cause of action? You understand what I'm saying? I mean, that's always a consequence.",
  "And yet, you -- you acknowledge that some things are jurisdictional.",
  "Well, wait. You -- you pleaded -- you pleaded that -- that the defendant was -- was an employer under the act. Right?",
  "And it's the definition of employer that says he has to have more than -- more than 15 employees. So, in effect, you -- in making your complaint, you -- you at least implied and maybe said that this person is an employer under the act. So it seems to me at that point the -- the burden shifts to the other side to say -- the burden of going forward of saying no, this person isn't an employer under the act, and if they say nothing, then they've accepted what -- what your complaint on its face says.",
  "I knew you would.",
  "Does it -- does it have to be resolved preliminarily? Why can't you leave the jurisdictional question to be decided at the conclusion of the trial with all the other questions? Is there some rule of law that says that a jurisdictional question must be confronted before the trial and before the merits? Indeed, most jurisdictional questions are reexamined as the trial proceeds. That is, you know, initially the court will say, yes, there appears to be jurisdiction on the basis of the pleading. Then if there's a motion to dismiss, yes, there -- there appears to be jurisdiction on the basis of the affidavits. But then if the trial proceeds and it turns out that, in fact, there isn't jurisdiction, the court dismisses. So why couldn't this jurisdictional question always be handled that way? Just -- just leave it to be resolved during the trial. It wouldn't slow anything up.",
  "Okay. So this is a third consequence of the jurisdictional issue.",
  "If the issue is jurisdictional, all the pendant State claims don't belong there and they've got to be chucked out; whereas, if it just goes to the merits, the pendant claims are properly before the court.",
  "That's an important consequence.",
  "Mr. Prendergast --",
  "-- my problem with -- with your -- your contention is that I don't know how it is that you -- that you intuit that this one definition is jurisdictional. I mean, the definition -- the -- the 15 employee limit is -- is part of the definition of employer in section 701.",
  "There are 13 other definitions in section 1701. For example, it defines on the basis of sex. Now, if -- if you contest whether a particular remark or a particular practice of the employer was -- fell within that definition, was on the basis of sex or not, would you say that the court had no jurisdiction?",
  "Will you challenge -- well, why are you challenging jurisdiction when you're -- when you're saying the -- the definition of -- of employer has not been met, but you are not challenging jurisdiction when you say the definition of on the basis of sex has not been met. Why -- why pick on one rather than the other?",
  "Yes, I -- I understand that.",
  "That -- that's what it comes down to.",
  "But how do you know --",
  "If both definitions in section 701 --",
  "-- why does one of them express one thing and another not express --",
  "In other words, it doesn't make a whole lot of difference.",
  "I'm not sure that helps your case.",
  "Do you think -- do you think it's possible that -- that Indian tribes could be jurisdictional but an employer couldn't? I mean, it seems to me the two the questions are quite different. An Indian tribe is always an Indian tribe. Right? And you're -- you're excluding -- just as a prosecutor is always a prosecutor. You're excluding a whole category of people. But you're -- you're not excluding a category of employers here, are you? Because it's a -- it's a factual question, whether at the time of the alleged offense, the particular company was employing more than 15 people. It isn't that this company forever has immunity.",
  "So you're -- you're not arguing for the Indian tribes here.",
  "Mr. Kirkpatrick, I don't recall what -- what the rule is. Does notice have to be given by registered mail? Would it -- would it be adequate notice in the -- in the ordinary case to send notice by regular mail?",
  "Yes, but do we have a case that says that, you have to use registered mail?",
  "I didn't think we did. And it would seem to me that especially when you have the taxpayer's name and address on file, I doubt whether it would be a denial of due process to send notice by regular mail to that address. And if -- if that satisfies due process, the State would never have known that it did not reach the individual.",
  "And it seems -- it seems mean to punish the State for going the extra mile and sending the notice by registered mail because that informed them that it didn't reach him.",
  "Would this case come out differently? You know, your client had an obligation to keep the State informed of -- of his -- his address so that they could send the tax bills to him, suppose the statute, in addition to simply reciting that obligation, said, and if the taxpayer does not keep the State advised of his current address, any notice mailed to the last address that he gave will suffice for all purposes.",
  "Suppose it said that explicitly. Would that -- would that make this case come out differently?",
  "Why? I mean, the State can punish people for not doing what the law tells them to do, and here the State is saying we tell you to keep us -- you keep us advised of your -- your address. If you don't, I guess we could throw you in jail for half a year, but no, we're not going to do that. We're just going to say that -- that your -- your punishment for violating the law is that this kind of a notice will suffice.",
  "Well, but there -- no, but this is a consequence of violating the law of -- of Arkansas. Certainly the State can impose consequences for violating its law.",
  "You know, and my next question is going to be, if you say it would come out differently, then isn't -- isn't it sort of silly to make the State go on and say that? If they could do the same thing by simply reciting what's going to happen, why -- why should we make them do that?",
  "Could they fine him for not -- could they fine him for not -- for not keeping them advised of -- of where -- where his tax address is?",
  "They could. Suppose they could. Right. Could they fine him -- how much money did you lose here?",
  "Could they fine him $70,000?",
  "It's pretty harsh, but do you think this Court would strike it down?",
  "You do.",
  "I'm not even sure it protects that minority. I think there are a lot of people who won't be home when the -- when the postman comes with the -- with the registered letter, but there are very few who -- who won't take the trouble to -- to pick it up. I mean, it may be --",
  "But isn't there a second purpose for -- for sending it certified mail? And that is, it assures that it doesn't get lost. I think they track it closer. They can tell you where the letter is. I think each post office has to record that they've received it and so forth.",
  "Whereas if you just sent it regular mail, it may have been lost.",
  "This -- this assures that it reaches the destination.",
  "Your -- your friend said that the $80,000 comes from the fact that it -- at the -- at the auction, it -- the opening bid is one-quarter of the fair market value. He said something like that.",
  "Well -- well, was the opening bid $20,000? So it was at least one-quarter of the --",
  "I see.",
  "I -- I don't -- I don't understand what you just said.",
  "No, but I mean, once it didn't come to a head in November and it was still an issue, why didn't you continue to run it?",
  "Mr. Bopp, did -- did the opinion refer to --",
  "-- sham ads?",
  "Did the opinion refer to --",
  "You think Congress has the power to prohibit any First Amendment contact -- conduct that might have an impact on the election? I mean, is that the criterion for whether it -- it can be prohibited?",
  "What was the bright line rule that -- that you think the -- the opinion established? I thought the bright line rule was whether it's an issue ad or -- or, rather, a phony issue ad. I thought that was the -- the line that -- that the opinion was trying to -- to draw. You -- you say that the opinion drew the line between what? All issue ads are out?",
  "No issue ads during the -- the blackout.",
  "No --",
  "Oh, of course, I know.",
  "And stand on your head. But the --",
  "Within -- within the framework of the statute, you think the clear line that is established by the opinion is no issue ads without this special funding during the blackout. You think that's what the opinion says?",
  "Why does it speak about sham issue ads?",
  "Why did you say there were 7 percent of these that -- that are probably okay?",
  "I -- I deny the first thing, that it's easy to do issue ads without naming the candidate. The -- the point of an issue ad is to put pressure on -- on the candidate that you want to vote your way. Without -- without telling people to call -- not the candidate -- the -- the incumbent that you want to vote your way -- without telling people to call the office of that incumbent, you're not doing very much.",
  "General Clement, you -- you've pointed out the difficulties, but I don't know any other area where we said, well, you know, the -- the -- when you're dealing with important -- important freedoms, important guarantees, where we shrug our shoulders and say, well, the only way to accomplish what the Government wants to do is to ride right -- right over those guarantees. I mean, we say, we -- we cannot bust up this -- this drug conspiracy unless we use warrantless searches. So, you know, whatever it takes. We don't -- we don't operate that way. And here, you're -- you're dealing with a very fundamental guarantee --",
  "-- the -- the right which I think applies to corporations, as well as to anybody else, and for individuals to associate with one another to bring to bear influence on the legislative process. That's a fundamental guarantee. And it doesn't satisfy me to say, well, there's no other way to stop people from criticizing incumbents during -- during the election blackout period. Maybe you can't do entirely what you want to do.",
  "Mr. Kasner, the -- does the Securities and Exchange Commission have enforcement authority in this -- in this area?",
  "Have they issued any rules or regulations on this -- on this point?",
  "On the point that you're arguing, whether the critical language means the person's own sale, or not - -",
  "Is it your position that we owe deference to the interpretation of the SEC?",
  "Well, if it's just Skidmore, forget about it.",
  "I mean, that's - -",
  "I always thought \"the\" meant \"the.\"",
  "And \"his or her\" means \"his or her.\"",
  "The Government doesn't say that \"all\" are covered. The Government acknowledges that there are some actions that could still be brought in State court.",
  "So -- it's so counterintuitive. As the Government points out, these holder claims lend themselves to abuse much more than do the narrow purchase-and-sale claims.",
  "And why - -",
  "-- why the Government would want to police the one, and let the other, you know, proliferate, seems very strange to me.",
  "No, because they -- I mean, the argument made by the Government: \"Of course not, because the only reason they're brought is precisely to evade this congressional legislation.\" They didn't exist, before; and they've become common, afterwards. Now -- you know, I -- you can say - -",
  "-- that they - -",
  "I thought that there were - - well, never mind.",

  "Mr. Frederick, it seems to me that the language \"in connection with,\" you know, whether it means what Blue Chip meant or whether it means what the statute meant, is at least ambiguous. And, if that's the case, why shouldn't we be guided by the Securities and Exchange Commission's determination, under Chevron, Mead, you know, anything but - -",
  "The - -",

  "Yes.",
  "I agree with that presumption against preemption, where the question is, Does this Federal statute, which says nothing about preemption, accidentally preempt some State law? -- that there, the presumption makes sense. But here, you have a statute, the whole object of which is preemption. And I'm not sure that what you shouldn't do in that case is just give the language its most reasonable meaning, with no thumb on either side of the scale.",
  "I suppose that a warrant like a -- like a contract has a -- a reasonable life. Don't you think a warrant expires if it does not have a concluding date? You think it goes on forever and ever and ever? Don't you think a warrant just lasts a reasonable time?",
  "Even -- even if the warrant did not specifically say that it was an anticipatory warrant and that -- and that you can only execute it after the delivery?",
  "But I thought that's supposed to be a -- a magistrate's determination.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, could -- could I ask you if the Government would -- would defend a -- an anticipatory warrant in these circumstances? The postal inspectors know that the unlawful video has been put in the mail and they know that it -- it is going to one of 17 individuals. They're not sure which one of the 17. So they go and get a warrant that says, you know -- and -- and it will be obvious in my hypothesis that the delivery of the video has occurred. So can they get a warrant that says you can go in -- it lists all of these 17 people. And it says you can go into their premises as soon as you see delivery of the video. Would -- would you support that kind of an anticipatory warrant?",
  "Well, then -- then -- well, I'm sorry to hear you say that because then you are really not saying that there has to be probable cause.",
  "Because at the outset there's no probable cause to believe that any one of those 17 -- unless you think one-seventeenth is enough for probable cause.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, but I'm not talking about a particular location. I'm talking about we know it's going to be one of 17 -- or make it 50, if you like. We don't know which of those.",
  "We want a warrant that will let us go in immediately when we see it delivered. Would you support that warrant?",
  "Yes. It's in somebody's home. It's into a home.",
  "Yes, but you don't want us to decide the case on that ground. I mean --",
  "It is probable that this package will be delivered to this individual. That probability exists at the time that the warrant is -- is issued.",
  "And that's the probable cause you're relying on.",
  "It is probable that this package will be delivered to this individual.",
  "Mr. Reichel, it -- it seems to me it's part of your case that the probable cause must be in existence at the moment the warrant is issued and that the magistrate cannot take into account the passage of time. Are you -- Suppose that -- that policemen apply for a -- a warrant in Manhattan which is to be served in Brooklyn, and it's going to -- it's going to take half an hour to get there. Everybody knows it's going to take half an hour. And the probable cause that they come up with is they know that this mob leader is going to be in this apartment between 6:30 and 6:45. Okay? And they present the warrant to the magistrate at -- at 6 o'clock. It will take half an hour to get to Brooklyn. The magistrate knows that when it's served, the mob leader will be in this apartment. Can that -- can that warrant issue?",
  "Right, and -- and likewise, it -- it would work the other way. If the magistrate had the same facts, the -- the mob leader is going to be there between 6:30 and 6:45, and the warrant is presented to him at 6:30, he would have to decline it because he knows by the time it's served, it's -- it's going to be gone. Right?",
  "So the magistrate is always looking to the condition when -- when the warrant is executed, and that's all that's happening here. There is probable cause to believe that this person will be receiving contraband. There is probable cause to believe it because he sent for it and it was mailed to him. It's just a matter of waiting till it gets there. There is probable cause to believe that he will receive it. And all you're doing is predicting in the future, saying the probable cause doesn't exist now, but it exists when the warrant will be executed. I don't see -- I don't see any real difference between that and the -- and the mob leader example I just --",
  "No, but it's probable. At the time that he issues the warrant, it is probable that this person will be receiving contraband because they showed, you know, this guy sent for it. He sent for the -- these child pornography films in -- in a -- you know, a Postal Service rouse, and we mailed it to him. It's probable that he's going to be receiving it.",
  "Can I --",
  "-- can I take you through my -- a variation of my earlier hypothetical? You say that the magistrate can issue the warrant at 6 o'clock, although he knows that there really won't be the probable cause until 6:30. You say that would be valid. He could issue it in Manhattan knowing that it wouldn't be served in -- in Brooklyn until 6:30. What if the magistrate specified that out of an abundance of caution? It's just the same case, but he writes on the warrant, this warrant is not to be served until 6:30. Does that make it invalid? Whereas, it was valid before, it's not valid if he -- if he says I am anticipating what will be the situation when the warrant is executed. He says it explicitly, it can't be served until 6:30. Does that make it bad?",
  "Doesn't it strike you as -- as strange that it's perfectly okay if he issues it at 6 o'clock, knowing that it'll be -- won't -- that there isn't probable cause now, but there will be at 6:30 when it will be served. You say that's perfectly okay. But if he says it on a warrant, not to be served until 6:30, it suddenly becomes bad.",
  "Oh, I see. So -- so you say so long as you say something as clear as 6:30, that's okay. It cannot be served until 6:30.",
  "I mean, the conversation is not occurring right now. The magistrate has to say in the future, when this warrant is executed, the conversation probably will be occurring. Right? And so also here. You know, the -- the receipt is not occurring now, but on the basis of all of the evidence before me, I think that that receipt will be occurring.",
  "Doesn't the Government concede this point? I had thought the Government conceded that this warrant would not have been validly executed if they went in before the triggering event. Otherwise, there's no purpose in putting in the triggering event. Maybe we'll have to get the Government to -- to state that explicitly, but that -- that's my understanding, that they acknowledge this warrant would not have been validly executed if they went in before the triggering event occurred. If that's not the case, I agree. I don't know why we took the case.",
  "So who --",
  "So who, what, and where includes when, but it doesn't include how. Right? Where -- where do you derive this proposition?",
  "Of course, all -- this whole argument begs the question. It -- it assumes that the particularity requirement includes time, not only who, what, where, but also when. Right? I mean, you -- you acknowledge that if you're wrong about that, if you're wrong about the fact that who, what, and where automatically includes when, the argument you've just made doesn't get anywhere.",
  "I understand that's your argument, but you agree that if -- if that argument is wrong, you're done.",
  "Well, and they -- and they found other -- other videotapes besides the one that had just been delivered, didn't they, in the course of the search?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, a quick yes or no. Does the Government concede that when you have an anticipatory warrant, the warrant is not properly executed until the -- the anticipated event occurs?",
  "It goes somewhat beyond the smallest trickle? Doesn't it? Doesn't it also include ditches that currently don't have any trickle if they obtain a trickle during a rainstorm?",
  "Couldn't you simply assume that anything that is discharged into a tributary ultimately goes where the tributary goes? Wouldn't it be enough to prove the discharge?",
  "So you don't think it would be enough for the -- for the Government to prove the discharge into a tributary in order to prove that the act has been violated.",
  "You really think it has to trace the molecules.",
  "More than that, Mr. Hopper. I thought and I had expected you to -- to respond to Justice Souter's question this way, his question about how come putting poison in -- in the wetlands is bad, but it's okay to put it in the tributary. But they -- as I understand it, the reason we held wetlands were included within the waters of the United States was not -- not that, that you could poison the waters by poisoning the wetlands, but rather, it was that it's very hard to tell where the navigable water ends and the wetland begins. And -- and we said, you know, we're not going to parse that. If it's -- if it's adjacent to a navigable water and it's wet, we're going to say it's part of a navigable water.",
  "I thought that was our basis.",
  "And, of course, that basis doesn't apply to tributaries, does it? You -- you can always tell where the tributary ends. It ends at the point where it goes into the main river.",
  "I'm not sure what you mean by a hydrological connection. Do you mean a constant -- a constant body of water between the two, or do you mean simply a -- a drain that at some times might carry off rainwater from -- from this land? And -- would that -- would that suffice to be a hydrological connection?",
  "Water never ran off of this -- of this land.",
  "Mr. Stoepker, your friend, Mr. Hopper, would certainly not agree with you that -- that a -- a hydrological connection is the, quote, traditional test. What -- what is your definition of tradition?",
  "How long has this test been established?",
  "Traditionally.",
  "Yes --",
  "From the inception of the rules.",
  "That that alone has been enough.",
  "I see. So you're -- you're not conceding that -- that hydrologic -- hydrological connection is adequate. You're just -- is sufficient. You're just saying it's necessary.",
  "Okay.",
  "You don't -- you don't have to define what -- everything that's necessary. All you have to define is one indispensable element. And all you're arguing is that a hydrological connection is an indispensable element, whatever additional elements --",
  "-- there may be. So you may agree with your friend, Mr. Hopper.",
  "You -- you just haven't reached that point. Right?",
  "I don't want to set you two to fighting with each other.",
  "What we're talking about here is -- is at -- at most, whether this is a water of the United States. The condition for requiring permits is that it -- it be a water of the United States. Isn't that right?",
  "And it either is or it isn't, not -- not that it will be. It either is or it isn't. If it is, you -- you need a permit; if it isn't, you don't need a permit.",
  "And the only reason it's a water of the United States is that there are some puddles on this land. Right? And if there were no puddles, it -- it wouldn't be a water of the United States. It would just be land of the United States.",
  "So it -- it becomes waters of the United States because there are puddles on it, and you assert because those puddles have some hydrological connection or if it is -- if it is water of the United States, those puddles have some hydrological connections with the navigable waters.",
  "And -- and the -- the statute only prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill material, which is what is going on here, into the navigable waters, right, at specified disposal sites. I'm sorry. The -- the permits that -- that are required here --",
  "-- permit discharge into waters, not -- not into lands that aren't waters.",
  "Do you think it -- do you think it mean adjacent with a berm in between? I -- I thought the reason they -- they reached that conclusion was you can't tell where the navigable water ends and where the wetland begins. I -- I thought they assumed a connection between the two.",
  "Even when it's not a body of water.",
  "A storm drain, even -- even when it's not filled with water, is a tributary. Right?",
  "Okay.",
  "I suggest it's very absurd to call that waters of the United States. It's a drainage ditch dug -- you know, dug by the municipality or -- you know, or a gutter in a street. To call that waters of the United States seems to me extravagant.",
  "What -- what percentage of the -- of the territory of the United States do you believe is -- is subjected to permits from the Corps of Engineers on your theory whenever you want to move dirt, whenever you want to deposit sand? What -- what percentage of the total land mass of the United States, if you define tributary as broadly as you define it to include? Every storm drain? I mean, it's the whole country, isn't it?",
  "All the water goes down to the sea and there's some kind of a drain or -- or a bed that takes the water down there.",
  "You're calling empty ditches -- not unless you call empty ditches land, which I do.",
  "I understand that.",
  "But -- but you -- that's just because this statute happens to refer to wetlands. But under your theory, the Corps of Engineers would have jurisdiction over any land that is part of that tributary system as well. If any of that land has a deposit of -- of some materials that could leach into or -- or drain into the -- the tributary system, which is to say any gutter, in theory, the -- the Federal Government can regulate it all. No?",
  "But in 1899, it just said navigable rivers, not -- not every -- every tributary defined to include even storm drains.",
  "Adjacent to what? Adjacent to a tributary. Right?",
  "But -- but here's -- here's the fly in the ointment. You -- you interpret tributary to include storm drains and ditches that only carry off rainwater. I mean, it makes an immense difference to the scope of jurisdiction of the Corps of Engineers. I mean, when you talk about adjacent to a tributary, I think, you know, maybe adjacent to the Missouri River or something like that. No. You're talking about adjacent to a storm drain.",
  "Only because I don't know how a storm drain is a water of the United States. That's all. I mean, all of these terms that you're throwing around somehow have to come within a reasonable usage of the term, waters of the United States, and I do not see how a storm drain under anybody's concept is a water of the United States.",
  "No. I was referring to a real storm drain.",
  "Okay?",
  "And some aren't. But -- but you would sweep them all into the jurisdiction of the Corps of Engineers.",
  "Well, but that -- but that doesn't follow. I mean, it is not a principle of law that so long as the object is -- is lawful and within the power of the United States, all means to which even that object are lawful. That is simply not true. There are various means of stopping that pollution, and it may well be that one of the means, which intrudes too deeply into the State's power to regulate land within their jurisdiction, is not a permissible one. That -- that's not an extraordinary proposition.",
  "I don't see how non-point source pollution is -- is any more remote from what the Federal Government should be able to do to achieve its ends than is a point source pollution that -- that consists of -- of dumping sand on land that has some puddles on it. I -- that seems to me just as remote.",
  "Though not necessarily as far as storm drains. It would be enough to -- to say navigable -- you know, non-navigable tributaries that are real -- real tributaries.",
  "It's a very vague indication. I mean, I -- I agree with you that your argument based on 404(g) is a strong one, but it -- it perhaps is weakened if you believe that in order to stretch to the -- to the limit of Federal jurisdiction, you need a clear statement. I certainly wouldn't consider 404(g) -- if -- if the act did not previously include the kind of authority you're arguing for, I would not -- I would not consider 404(g) a clear statement of that -- of that new -- new authority.",
  "So you say that the authority of -- I don't -- I don't even think the Corps has ever suggested this. The authority of the Corps extends not only to all that you've -- we've been talking about and that you've asserted, but also to lands that, if altered, could have some hydrological connection.",
  "What is -- what is the basis for their doing it? If there is currently no hydrological connection, there is a berm, there is no -- there is no connection to the navigable waters of the United -- what could possibly be the basis for their asserting jurisdiction?",
  "Yes, I --",
  "A statute could do that. A statute could do that. But this statute requires that it be a water of the United States.",
  "And -- and when -- when there is nothing but puddles that are isolated by a berm, even from the storm drain which goes to tributaries, I can't conceive of -- of how you could consider that that's -- you know, at least where it leaks sometimes into the storm drain and went down to a tributary, I think it's an exaggeration, but maybe you could call it a water of the United States. But where there's a berm that prevents any water from going even into the storm drain which then goes into a tributary, how can you possibly consider that a water of the United States?",
  "That's not the argument I was addressing. I'm addressing the argument that in changing the land, you may cause it to --",
  "I'm happy to hear that. That's all I was trying to establish. You -- you don't assert that that's an independent basis.",
  "Mr. Hopper, I hope you're going to tell us what you make of section 404(g).",
  "You're saying the changes occur in the river, above the dam; and, therefore, what's left -- what's let back into the river below the dam is the same river, unchanged.",
  "And not the release. You contest that the release makes any change.",
  "I must say, this --",
  "-- this doesn't seem to me normal usage. I don't think if -- you know, if you see a rapids in a river, it would be strange to say the rapids of the Colorado \"discharge\" into the Colorado. You're usually talking about a different body of water. You could say the Green River discharges into the Colorado. Likewise, a waterfall, you wouldn't say, you know, \"The waterfall on this river discharges into the river.\" It's part of the river. But if it were a waterfall that brought a tributary into the river, you would then say that, you know, \"the waterfall discharges into the Colorado,\" or whatever river it enters at that point. It seems to me very strange to talk about a river discharging into itself.",
  "But the --",
  "-- the issue is not whether there is a discharge, as I see it. The issue is whether there's a \"discharge into the river.\" And one does not usually speak of the \"river discharging into itself.\" That -- it's the \"into\" that's the crucial part. How do you distinguish this case from Miccosukee, if I'm saying it right? -- yes, Miccosukee --",
  "-- where we had, you know, a pumping of water from one polluted body into another, and it was held -- we held that that was not a discharge?",
  "It --",
  "That's right.",
  "But the crucial --",
  "-- word was \"discharge.\" The reason we held it was not covered is not because there was no pollutant. It was clear that there was a pollutant. But we held there was no discharge.",
  "Because there was no discharge of a pollutant. There were pollutants in - - on both sides. That -- I think that was conceded in the case. The reason that the case came out the way it did was that we held there was no discharge of a pollutant.",
  "Wasn't it conceded that there was a pollutant -- that a pollutant was involved in that case?",
  "So, what must have been the difference was that there was no discharge.",
  "There was no discharge of anything. It was clear that if there was a -- if there was a discharge, it was a discharge of a pollutant.",
  "Well, only if you assume that letting out the same water into the same river is pollution. It seems to me you're begging the question.",
  "You --",
  "If there were a discharge of something into the river, you'd be able to move against it. But the question here is whether there's any discharge into the river when you stop the river and then let the same river out.",
  "Are they maximums or minimums?",
  "I expect that they're minimums.",
  "Well, any significant obstruction in the river amounts to a -- creates a discharge.",
  "Indeed, if it's a small enough stream, I suppose just swimming in it or lying sideways so you impede the flow, you are causing a discharge into the waters of the United States. I find that peculiar.",
  "Well, it depends on how big the river is, doesn't it?",
  "Section 402 uses \"discharge\" in the same sense, I assume.",
  "Why doesn't it?",
  "Yes --",
  "It is -- it is broader. But if -- the discharge of a pollutant into the same body of water does not constitute the addition of a pollution -- of a pollutant. It obviously is the addition of a pollutant. The only reason you could say that taking it from one -- pumping it from one polluted body to another is not a discharge of a pollutant, which is what we said in Miccosukee, the only basis for saying that is that there has been no discharge. There's obviously been an addition of a pollutant to the -- to the other body of water. The only thing you can say is, there hasn't been a discharge. It's -- because it's the same body of water.",
  "If, in Miccosukee, liquid of the same composition had been taken from another body of water, and from -- not the body of water that was adjacent and which we held was the same body of water - - with the same composition, and that had been added, do you think Miccosukee would have come out the same way?",
  "Really? That you could take pollutants from a different body of water and add it to an already polluted stream? I thought that was clear that that's not the case.",
  "Exactly.",
  "Because if it was one body of water, it was okay, and if it was two bodies of water, it was bad, right?",
  "But it would add pollutants to the other body whether it comes from the adjacent body or whether it comes from some distant body. The only reason that the pumping from the adjacent body did not qualify is -- not because there no addition of pollutants. There would be an addition of pollutions from a distant lake, and you -- we'd be able to hold a person liable. The only reason there was no addition here was that there was -- there was an addition here, but there was no discharge, because it was the same body of water.",
  "And I --",
  "-- it seems to me that's --",
  "-- what you have here.",
  "Now, there's some dispute as to whether that -- that is really what -- what it held. And there's a big difference. If -- if you just say whenever you -- whenever the prosecution has a strong case, you can't introduce other guilt, or whether all that the court is saying is that one of the elements that you consider in determining whether to admit this -- this third party is not just -- it's the comparative weakness of the third party case. You don't blind yourself to -- to the strength of the prosecution's case. Will you say it was bad even if it was the latter that the court was -- was referring to? Are you saying you cannot consider the strength of the prosecution's case at all in determining whether to allow in third party guilt evidence?",
  "You think -- you think there's no difference where really very questionable evidence about some third party's guilt is -- is produced in a case where -- where the State's case barely makes it over the -- over the line to get to the jury and you think it's -- it's the same call where that barely questionable third party evidence is -- is put in in opposition to a State's case that is -- is watertight -- I mean, you know, forensic evidence, all sorts of proof. You -- you think the two have to be treated the same.",
  "Does the other side agree with that? I -- I'd be surprised if that were the law in the other 49 jurisdictions, that the judges just blind themselves to the -- to the prosecution's case when they make these calls.",
  "What's your authority for -- for the -- for opposition that every other jurisdiction does it that way?",
  "We're not arguing about that. I -- I don't think anybody has asked you that question. The question is whether you can consider it at all, and -- and you say no.",
  "Not -- not harmless you mean.",
  "It's not what the court said, though. The court didn't -- did -- whatever the court said, it clearly did not say just looking at the third party guilt evidence by itself, it's not -- it's not trustworthy. Whatever else it said, it didn't say that.",
  "Okay. Yes. Now, you say that's true. Now, it may well have been true, but that -- we're -- we're --",
  "That's right.",
  "And as I recall, the trial court did say that this was pretty persuasive evidence but for the fact that you had to exclude some of it because that there was no exception to the hearsay rule. Didn't he say that?",
  "He said more than that. I think he said it was --",
  "Well --",
  "Your friend will tell us what he said.",
  "Mr. Zelenka, do you agree that all 49 other States do not look at the -- at the weight of the prosecution's case when making this decision?",
  "Excluding the confession. Excluding the confession.",
  "Has anybody else looked at the evidence on both sides?",
  "Other States I mean. Other States.",
  "Why wasn't it in the baby- shaking case?",
  "Why was there no credibility determination made in the baby-shaking case you just described? Didn't -- didn't you have to conclude that the evidence concerning the time of death was -- was credible, was accurate?",
  "Mr. Johnson, your -- your citation of the -- of the portion of the -- of the trial court opinion, which says that there was no corroboration of the -- of the confession, that was not stated in -- to say, and therefore, the confessions were weak evidence. That point was made in order to say, therefore, the confession cannot be admitted because the -- the rule was it's hearsay, but hearsay that's corroborated can be admitted. So I think you're misdescribing the --",
  "Why are they dire? I mean, he's just back in the situation he would have been in, did he not comply with the conditions of his parole. I don't see that that's dire. He has a choice. He can stay in prison and --",
  "-- and suffer the reduction of privacy there, which is much, much greater than being subjected to -- I mean, he -- he cannot even go to the toilet in privacy. Or he can go out on parole, subject to the condition that --",
  "-- that he --",
  "-- he can --",
  "-- be searched.",
  "No, but it's --",
  "-- but it's also clear from the California statute that it is not a right, that it's a privilege, that you get the privilege of parole in exchange -- in exchange for agreeing to the conditions, one of which is that you can be searched.",
  "California statute says it's a privilege, doesn't it?",
  "It does.",
  "Even if the --",
  "-- prisoner -- oh, I thought that he can turn it down, and that some prisoners do, if --",
  "-- if they decide that they don't want to be subjected to searches.",
  "Is -- and you mean people are put out on the street when -- kicking and screaming when they say, \"No, I want to stay in jail. I don't want to be\" --",
  "-- \"searched. I would rather stay in jail\"? And --",
  "-- they are dragged out --",
  "-- into the street. Is that what happens?",
  "Oh, I --",
  "-- I don't think so.",
  "When he's in prison, is there any problem about the prison guards intruding upon his privacy, willy-nilly, whenever they choose?",
  "I mean, walking --",
  "-- by his cell, which is always opened, and checking in on him to see what's -- what he's doing.",
  "So, he's better off on parole than -- well, at least no worse off on parole than he would be when he was in prison.",
  "Are --",
  "Not --",
  "-- by me. No, please.",
  "But there is a breathtakingly high probability that he is committing a crime. The statistics cited in the Government's brief say that in an April 2001 report prepared by the California Criminal Justice Statistics Center, 68 percent of adult parolees are returned to prison -- 68 percent; 55 percent, for a parole violation; and 13 percent for the commission of a new felony offense. I mean, it seems to me a breathtaking statistic like that may call for breathtaking --",
  "-- measures to try to police the matter closely.",
  "You say there was a case in which, without any special reason, they did --",
  "-- a cavity search --",
  "The California Supreme Court may -- might well hold that it's arbitrary to conduct such an extreme search as a body-cavity search, or to - - I don't know --",
  "-- to decide to search the person when he's in the men's room or something. I mean, there are --",
  "-- there are a lot of limitations that the California court --",
  "-- could put on it, within the context of harassment or --",
  "Mr. Long, is it -- is it fair to compare California to other States? The assumption would have to be that other States grant parole as liberally as California does. Maybe California has made the decision, \"We have too many people in prison. We're going to let a lot of them out, but we're going to keep them on a very tight leash.\" Why shouldn't it be able to do that? To have tighter controls, but let out many more people on parole, which is -- which is exactly what I think they're doing.",
  "But my only --",
  "-- point is --",
  "-- the fact that other States aren't as tight doesn't prove anything, because other States --",
  "-- may not be --",
  "-- be trying to do the same thing --",
  "-- to empty their prisons --",
  "Is --",
  "Is --",
  "Is that right? I mean, even in prison, I -- what -- I'm not sure you could even do that if they were still in prison. Can you subject people in prison --",
  "No. No, I --",
  "The Chief Justice was trying to get out of the Fourth Amendment into the Fifth.",
  "Most --",
  "Most States --",
  "-- don't let felons vote. I mean, that's a punishment that they impose after they're out of prison.",
  "It seems to me that the principal difference, Mr. Niver, is that when he's on parole, it's in lieu of being in jail. If that's not the difference, you don't persuade me. He has voluntarily accepted the parole in exchange for his getting out of jail. And he'd be in worse condition if he were in jail. That's what, seems to me, makes the difference.",
  "I thought you said that maybe cavity searches would not -- would not be allowed without some special reason for them. And that wouldn't necessarily be harassment.",
  "Yes --",
  "I mean --",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, suppose you couldn't - -",
  "-- you couldn't --",
  "-- conduct cavity searches without some special reason, even in prison. Wouldn't that be -- isn't there some remnant of a fourth- amendment right in prison that you cannot subject, you know, the whole cellblock to cavity searches?",
  "Do we --",
  "I think he said he was unaware of anybody who was dragged out kicking and screaming.",
  "No.",
  "He's asking you, I think, Justice Alito's question, \"Do we have to get into that?\" So long as this one's okay, why do -- why do we have to get into whether there might be some other ones that aren't okay?",
  "But we --",
  "-- we normally don't look into the mind of the officer to decide whether his action was okay or not.",
  "Or the other side may say, \"Although technically the statute of limitations applied here, taking all considerations into account we think that this prisoner acted with reasonable promptness, and perhaps the delay was somewhat attributable to the State.\" Do you think that that's a proper consideration?",
  "But you -- it could be argued that the Federal Government wants to move them along speedily, whether or not the State government wants to.",
  "So, that would suggest that the State's voluntary waiver of a statute of limitations should not make any difference. It's a Federal -- it's a Federal interest involved, not a State interest.",
  "Why does -- proceeding under 15 does not do that; whereas, proceeding this way does?",
  "Wink, wink?",
  "I mean, there is some value in that, I think, particularly where the State has expressly conceded timeliness. I mean, the magistrate judge in this case, all that he had before him was the express concession from the State. He never -- the State never said anything in the District Court, even after he issued his notice to the Petitioner to show cause why it wasn't untimely. So, the magistrate judge, all he had before him was the State's position that it was timely.",
  "Must there be good reasons for the judge to say, quote, \"I'm surprised that you haven't raised a statute of limitations defense\"?",
  "Must there be good reason for that? And, if not, aren't you asking us to waste our time?",
  "Why don't you do it the easier way and --",
  "Well, what's your answer as to whether there is any limitation on the judge just suggesting, \"By the way, you know, is there some reason why you haven't pleaded statute of limitations?\" Can a -- can a judge do that?",
  "And what -- when would it be an abuse of discretion?",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "So, you'd say it would be okay if the State didn't expressly concede the statute of limitations point.",
  "That's --",
  "That's what I thought your --",
  "-- position was.",
  "Okay. So, this --",
  "-- a fallback position.",
  "You think the court \"must.\"",
  "Well, don't you think that's what this court thought? And, if so, shouldn't we perhaps send it back to see whether, if the court knew that it had discretion, it would have done this?",
  "What if Congress wanted to leave it to the State to waive the statute of limitations provision? How could it have made that clear? I mean, I would have thought that if they made it a statute of limitations provision instead of a jurisdictional provision -- I mean, they could have said, you know, \"No jurisdiction if it's filed beyond a certain date, and we mean it.\" But it put it as a statute of limitation, which normally is waivable. And I would think that that is an indication that Congress thought, \"Really, if the State thinks that in this particular case we shouldn't hew to the technicality of the statute of limitation, the State ought to be able to waive it.",
  "Well, it's always a technicality. What you're saying is, the only time that the State can do that is when the answer to the statute of limitations is unclear. And I'm saying sometimes the State may say, \"The answer is clear, but doggone it, this is just too picky-picky, too technical in this particular case.\"",
  "You acknowledge at least this much, or am I incorrect? And it's important for me to know that. You acknowledge at least this much, that if we read this opinion, as you do not, to be saying that the court \"must\" do this so that the court was not really considering all factors in the exercise of its discretion, we would have to remand.",
  "All right.",
  "Excuse me. From what you just said, I take it that means that even when the State is unwilling to change its mind and says, \"No, we would still prefer not to assert the defense,\" you would allow the court to impose it.",
  "The answer --",
  "-- is yes.",
  "Why isn't it dismissed on the basis that they -- they don't have a cause of action because they've assigned it?",
  "Ms. --",
  "Ms. Millett, you've been trying to tell us the difficulties that the State would have in bringing suit later.",
  "What are they? I see your white light is on.",
  "I'd like to hear what they are.",
  "What -- what incentive does she have to cooperate in that later action? And isn't it the fact that she would have a disincentive to cooperate if she's going to have to reimburse the insurance companies for any additional compensation that they pay?",
  "Well, it -- but -- but don't some of the insurance policies require that if the insurance company, which has settled the first claim, ends up paying -- paying additional money, that that -- that that amount of money would be the -- the responsibility of the -- of the claimant?",
  "So that's a disincentive on her part. She doesn't want the insurance company to lose any more money.",
  "Well, it seems to me that that's a very strange system for the Federal Government to set up and to -- to -- I mean, to -- to subsidize -- to reward the failure of the -- of the Medicaid benefit -- beneficiary to cooperate. There's a statutory responsibility for her to cooperate, isn't there?",
  "And she didn't do that here because she just went ahead and settled without -- without giving the State notice.",
  "Really.",
  "I mean, the State is a party to the proceeding, and she goes ahead and gets the proceeding dismissed without even telling the State, and that -- that isn't included in the -- the responsibility to cooperate?",
  "The complaint -- the -- the intervention by the State claimed only a lien? Is that what the --",
  "-- document claimed? Intervention --",
  "Yes, but the -- the other thing that you're -- you're dividing that against is not liquidated.",
  "And nobody -- I mean, the -- where there's room for -- for compromise is certainly in the pain and suffering part of a settlement, not in the medicals. I mean, the medicals are a given in any settlement I've ever heard of. There it is, black on white. This is how much was paid.",
  "That's the compromise. Unless there's a -- you know, a compromise on whether there's liability or not, but -- but whether, if there is liability, this amount is owing, that's -- that's a given for the medicals. Isn't it?",
  "Wouldn't -- wouldn't the insurance company have to worry about the same problem? That is to say, even if it's not your problem by reason of our coming out the way you would like us to, wouldn't it remain a problem for the insurance company so they could not enter into any settlement until they knew that the State would go along with -- with the division between medicals and -- and other damages? That -- that's what I don't understand. Doesn't it become a problem for the insurance company to somehow bring in the State in the process of the settlement?",
  "Right.",
  "Okay, but once -- once the -- once the -- the foolish insurance company figures out that that is what is going to happen, future settlements will be very difficult I would gather.",
  "And your argument is if it is six in one, half -- half a dozen in the other, we should do it your way because that's what the text of the statute says.",
  "You're talking about the Federal statute --",
  "-- not the State statute.",
  "The State statute clearly goes beyond that and says --",
  "But I assume the State -- the State tries to get around that by saying it never -- never became the property of your client, that by reason of the assignment provision, all choses in action automatically vest in the State, causes of action arising out of transactions in which there's a claim for Medicaid compensation.",
  "But you say -- you say they can't do that because, at the time the accident occurs, you don't even know that there's going to be a claim --",
  "Excuse me. I really didn't understand that argument. Does the State deduct from its Medicaid funds the amount that it pays lawyers to conduct Medicaid litigation?",
  "Well, then it doesn't matter as far as the Medicaid funds are concerned. It comes out of general State revenues. Right?",
  "Or at least where -- where the limitation -- you make a big point of this in your brief as -- as I -- as I recall. At least where the reason the candidate would have to spend so much time is the very small contribution limit established by the same statute. It's -- it's rather like the -- the murderer asking for mercy because he's an orphan, having killed his parents.",
  "And we -- we didn't send it back so that more of a record could be made, did we?",
  "Well, but you know. You expect them to name names? I mean, here --",
  "Really, that -- that's -- that's a lot to ask.",
  "Only -- only the most corruptible.",
  "Well, it would also prevent the candidate himself from expending his entire fortune, if he wishes, in informing people of why he should be elected --",
  "-- think that's okay.",
  "Which raises no possibility of corruption.",
  "I don't know what you mean they have an exception for the wealthy family.",
  "Excuse me. What -- what amounts were suspiciously large?",
  "To the extent that Vermont legislators can be bought off by $51?",
  "That's very sad.",
  "But that's the limit you've placed on -- on contributions.",
  "I mean, the -- you know, if -- if you accept more than $51, you're -- you're likely to have your vote determined by that.",
  "Then why -- why the $50 limit? It certainly isn't based on the corruption --",
  "It shows that on average. It doesn't show that in the competitive races, which is where the -- where the shoe pinches.",
  "That's just what I said. Your figures show that the average spending is below, but that's not what's significant. What's significant is what Justice Breyer posed, where -- where there is a contested race and -- and some new candidate wants to unseat somebody who's been in there for years. That's -- that's where the shoe pinches.",
  "Did he have a primary?",
  "That's another feature of -- of this scheme that I find quite puzzling. You get the same expenditure limit for the election cycle whether you go through a primary or not. What an advantage that is for the incumbent.",
  "If the burden is on the candidate to establish that -- that somebody's expenditure is independent and shouldn't be counted against his expenditure limit.",
  "A presumption, which means the burden, to go forward and show the opposite, is on him. Right?",
  "And the money that he spends in overcoming that presumption is charged against his expenditure. Isn't that right?",
  "The other side says the opposite. I'll ask them whether that's --",
  "And thereafter, all the -- all the candidate has to say is in an affidavit, no, it wasn't coordinated, and then the burden is on the State to show that it was.",
  "Okay, the opposing candidate or the State.",
  "No, but I -- I thought that the point was that the public mistrusts their representatives because of large donations, and I thought the point being made was, well, if that's the case and the public sees that this fellow has gotten a $10,000 donation, the public will say this -- this fellow is in that -- is in that corporation's or that person's pocket.",
  "And I won't vote for that person. You -- you don't have to show that -- out of the mouth of the candidate, that -- that he voted for the bill because he got $10,000. The mere fact that it's on the public record that he got $10,000, if -- if what you say is correct, that -- that people are worried about, the -- the corruptive effect of such donations, people should logically vote against that candidate who accepts so much money.",
  "I thought -- I thought what that case said and what many of our other cases say, with regard to expenditures in particular, is that you're not talking about money here. You're talking about speech. So long as all that money is going to campaigning, you're talking about speech. And when you say you don't need any more speech than this, that's a very odd thing for -- for a -- a United States Government to say. Enough speech. You don't need any more than this. And that's the reason the expenditure limits, as opposed to contribution limits, were regarded quite differently in Buckley and I think should still be regarded differently today. You're constraining speech. It's not money you're constraining. Contribution limits, you're constraining money, but when you say you can't expend more than this on your campaign, you're saying, no, no, no, this is enough speech. We're going to -- we, the State, are going to tell you how much you should campaign. That's very unusual in -- in American democracy.",
  "Limit the contributions.",
  "That solves that problem. Limit the contributions.",
  "But you want to limit expenditures, even if it's the person's own money. No possibility of corruption. You're saying, no, this is enough speech. We don't want to hear any more from you. We, the State, will tell you how much campaigning is enough. That's extraordinary.",
  "I don't understand how that comes. How does that come about?",
  "Any exception whatever.",
  "So if -- if the contention in the -- in the bankruptcy proceeding is that the will which has been probated by the State probate court is, in fact, not the true will and that under the true will, the bankruptcy estate would get money, you think the bankruptcy court would -- would have jurisdiction to probate the will.",
  "All right. Well, I'm willing to -- to move it back. I mean, that's -- that's even harder for you. But let's assume that the will is in probate but has not yet been probated. Do you think the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to decide which will is the true will?",
  "Yes or no.",
  "All right.",
  "Do you want to stand on this position, Mr. Richland, or do you have a lesser position --",
  "-- that -- that might cause you to win? Because --",
  "But you could say the same thing about diversity jurisdiction, that Congress contemplated that there would be diversity jurisdiction where there was no bankruptcy jurisdiction and no Federal question jurisdiction. I mean, I don't see what that proves.",
  "I'm just saying no more so than -- than when Congress enacted diversity jurisdiction. It intended it to apply, you know, uniformly.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's true.",
  "You want to look moderate.",
  "What do you mean by no jurisdiction to probate a will? Could -- could -- does that exclude the possibility of a bankruptcy court deciding for itself where there are contested wills that in its in view the -- the right -- the valid will is a certain one and that, therefore, the bankruptcy estate includes this fund or doesn't include this fund? Is that probating the will?",
  "Well, if that isn't probating a will, the exception for probating a will doesn't -- doesn't amount to a hill of beans, does it?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, and that this is -- that this is the -- the last will and testament and that there is not some other one.",
  "Okay. Now, can -- can the bankruptcy court determine that, that the -- that the proper will and testament of this decedent is this one? We're not probating it. No, no.",
  "We don't pretend to probate it. We're just saying that this happens to be the true will and testament.",
  "We could just say whatever its scope is it ain't this. I mean, couldn't we do that?",
  "But it isn't probated. That's -- it is, indeed, a will substitute. The whole purpose of doing it is to avoid probate.",
  "Was it an estate plan or a will?",
  "I mean, you -- you -- you're stretching the probate concept from determining whether the will is valid or invalid and who inherits under the will to also determining what goes into the probate estate, that is, the insurance policies, the trust, and so forth. That to me is -- is something quite different from probating a will.",
  "But that -- but that's res judicata. I mean, that -- that isn't necessarily a -- an application of -- of any probate exception.",
  "You say that, but that case doesn't say that.",
  "What -- what case do you have that says that?",
  "But the mere fact that you have jurisdiction to say something does not mean that if -- if some other court says the same thing first, you won't be bound by that.",
  "Well -- I -- I guess, in -- in going beyond the Eleventh Amendment, we were appealing to an understanding of sovereignty that existed at the time of the framing.",
  "And at the time of the framing, counties in England did not enjoy the -- the sovereign immunity of the king, did they?",
  "Do you -- do you agree that -- that it's possible that an entity can have sovereign immunity in admiralty where -- where the same entity would -- would not have it elsewhere?",
  "I find that discussion quite perplexing.",
  "They're talking about immunity in most of the cases, not necessarily --",
  "-- not necessarily sovereign immunity.",
  "Hans -- Hans is residual sovereign immunity.",
  "Some -- some of our brethren don't -- don't agree with it. They don't like the residue and would limit it to the Eleventh Amendment.",
  "If you're going to have a residue, Hans is it I suppose.",
  "Nor could charities. They were immune as well. But it -- it certainly wasn't sovereign immunity.",
  "The question presented is -- is only sovereign immunity, isn't it? It's -- we don't have to decide whether there might be some other type of immunity.",
  "Mr. Hart --",
  "Mr. --",
  "Well, core -- core government functions isn't -- isn't the test either. I mean --",
  "-- you know, the Federal Government and I think some States gave -- gave railroads the power to condemn land. Did that make railroads sovereigns entitled to sovereign immunity? I don't think so.",
  "So the mere fact that -- that your county is exercising some, quote, core government functions, that -- that doesn't -- doesn't get you there.",
  "It wasn't sovereign immunity. It was -- charities had immunity until very recently. Some States still had it when I was in law school. You couldn't sue a charity for tort.",
  "What are you relying on in the Georgia constitution? It doesn't mention counties, does it? It just says except as specifically provided in this paragraph, sovereign immunity extends to the State and all of its departments and agencies.",
  "There can be no -- no -- well, I assume you have a -- a tort -- tort claims act that waives sovereign immunity in some circumstances.",
  "But apart from that, you can't sue counties in tort.",
  "Well, that's bridge immunity, not sovereign immunity. I mean --",
  "-- it doesn't come -- it doesn't come within the Federal Constitution.",
  "Well, no, I'm not talking about textually. I'm talking about in structure. There's nothing in the structure that has anything to do with bridges.",
  "If it wishes. If it wishes.",
  "The State can pay my damages if it wishes. It just doesn't happen to have a statute to that effect right now. But I mean, that -- surely, that doesn't -- doesn't --",
  "That was an old Fifth Circuit case --",
  "I always thought the governmental proprietary distinction really came up in State law cases involving municipal liability. That's principally where it --",
  "You think there has to be somebody who can challenge it, though.",
  "Some of our opinions say that, don't they, that --",
  "-- it's not necessarily true that there has to be --",
  "In any case, it's clear that that -- that that entity no longer has standing, isn't it?",
  "Yes.",
  "But they don't --",
  "But they don't -- I mean, I thought the assumption here is that they don't have standing. The --",
  "The former standing of Kim's Auto cannot allow this suit to proceed, under any theory --",
  "-- can it?",
  "Don't you have to have standing during the entire --",
  "-- process --",
  "Yes, but the only person who could give them standing, even by this associational theory, is gone.",
  "But --",
  "But they are not property taxpayers who have standing under any -- under the argument that you've just made.",
  "The only property-tax individual who had standing was somebody whose land had been condemned. None of these other people in it have had their land condemned --",
  "-- have they?",
  "Whose land has been condemned.",
  "Well, but --",
  "-- but you say that a property taxowner, simply by being -- simply by being subject to the property tax, does not having standing. Isn't that your position?",
  "There's also a redressability problem, too, isn't there? I mean, assuming they could, is there any -- would action against the Assembly eliminate their tax?",
  "No?",
  "And the credit's available to out-of-State companies.",
  "Counsel, could I ask about the ancillary doctrine? You say the case you cite to establish it is Flast versus Cohen. Was the doctrine discussed in Flast versus Cohen, or are you relying simply on the fact that Flast versus Cohen involved both an Establishment Clause and a free-exercise challenge, and the Court only discussed the Establishment Clause challenge?",
  "Okay. I --",
  "-- I had not --",
  "-- recollected that footnote. I will -- I will find it. I don't read footnotes, normally.",
  "What about the fact that a State has a lower income tax or a lower property tax than any other State in the Union? Does that violate the Commerce Clause because it induces businesses to --",
  "The only one who gets the advantage of the lower -- the lower income tax rate and the lower property tax rate is someone who is located in the State. It's exactly the same.",
  "I told you, you have to locate -- you'd have to locate in the low-tax State to get advantage of the low -- of the low tax.",
  "Likewise, a business that does not locate in Ohio is not subject to the -- to the higher Ohio tax, which has been reduced for them.",
  "I mean, they're --",
  "-- they're exempt from it entirely, which is even better, I suppose.",
  "Was the legislation that established this tax benefit -- was it controversial? Were there those who opposed it as a giveaway to --",
  "Well, they --",
  "I have -- I will take judicial cognizance of the fact that such proposals are sometimes politically controversial. Isn't that the place to fight out this thing? Isn't your basic objection here that you don't agree that a State should give tax credits to business, and that's something that, you know, is in the political arena, and let the people fight it out?",
  "Why should that be an issue that a court should decide?",
  "Yes, but they're -- what our opinions hold are that there are some matters of producing the same result as a cash subsidy --",
  "-- that are no good, but there are other matters that are perfectly okay.",
  "And the mere fact that it has the same effect as a cash subsidy is not a problem, as far as the Commerce Clause is concerned. And what you're arguing here is, the mere fact that it has that effect of favoring businesses that choose to locate in Ohio is what makes it bad, not the fact that it's relieving, from a tax that applies to both in-State and out-of-State businesses, only in-State business. That's -- that was the Hawaii case, and all the other cases you cite. But what your argument here is that the mere fact of providing a subsidy violates the Commerce Clause. And I don't know --",
  "-- any case --",
  "But that tax did apply to out-of-State businesses --",
  "-- and they got no reduction --",
  "-- right?",
  "A lot of money in building homes.",
  "You don't believe in harmonization, Mr. Olson?",
  "You think that's no good.",
  "Not -- not even to prevent retrogression, which would violate section 5.",
  "But that was done for political reasons, not racial reasons.",
  "But what -- what is your proposal? What -- what is -- what is a State to do if -- assuming there is a political motivation in drawing its districts, perfectly valid political motivation let's assume, and the result of that redrawing is that it would eliminate a majority minority district, what -- what is the State supposed to do?",
  "Surely, that's not what makes it bad. Even if they created a compact district but with the -- with the intent of creating a majority minority district, that would be a district created for a racial reason. The mere fact that this one happens to be not compact doesn't eliminate the motivation, and -- and I don't see how you can avoid that motivation unless you're going to abandon the -- the prohibition against regression.",
  "Wow. That's a surprise.",
  "Which -- but it's a perfectly constitutional basis to alter the map because we don't think it allocates the seats in the fashion that our political power enables us to -- to provide for. Legislatures redraw the maps all the time for political reasons. I mean, to say that this is, you know, something horrible is ridiculous. You acknowledge that political motivation is fine.",
  "Don't you?",
  "I see.",
  "Even -- even when the map is so distorted -- you -- you acknowledge that the map that came out, after this -- this realignment of districts, had less of a divergence between the voting strength of the Republican Party and the number of Republican seats than had existed under the previous allocation by the Democrats.",
  "I'm saying less. Less. It -- there's less of a divergence under the new map than there was under the old one. The only difference is this divergence is in favor of the majority.",
  "Yes, but what percentage did they have? I -- I thought that -- you say that they should have gotten 20 districts, and how many districts did the plan give them?",
  "But you say that's what they should have had, given -- given the voting in the State.",
  "Do you have any -- any authority either in the text of the Constitution or in a -- a case for the proposition that the only reason a legislature can reapportion its districts is because there's been a census?",
  "Well, but that's your position when you said mid-decade redistricting is bad because your -- your position is the only reason is the census is -- has -- has caused there to be less than -- than one man/one vote.",
  "That -- that little -- even if it's done by the court. I like the way you slipped that in. I mean, even if you had a general rule that you cannot redistrict except after a decennial census, surely there ought to be an exception unless -- which -- which would read, unless the districting you're living under was never decreed by the legislature, but was decreed by a court. And that was the situation here. Surely, that's a good reason, even if you adopted your general proposition.",
  "Well, I'd say that's a shame for the democratic process. I -- I don't like the idea that -- that there are a lot of districts out there that have never been drawn by the people, which is what the Constitution envisions.",
  "I don't understand. Does this go to motive or result? I mean, what if I'm -- I'm stupid and I think there's the correlation and I remove it for that reason? I'm not removing them for racial reasons. I'm removing them because I want to remove Democrats. And you're saying that if I have made a mistake about how solidly they vote Democratic, that turns my validly non-racial decision into a racial decision?",
  "I'm assuming --",
  "-- they're removing them because they're Democrats, but I'm wrong about that.",
  "I thought you said that the county was 92 percent Latino or something like that.",
  "Well, how can you -- how can you possibly take out any substantial number of Democrats without taking out Latinos?",
  "Well, that's my point too.",
  "But, of course, you want them to use race to manipulate outcomes. It's just sometimes.",
  "No. I was going to say I -- if I were gerrymandering, I would absolutely want to leave majority other party districts in which the people from the other party were voting for a candidate from my party with some regularity. I'd want to do that. That's exactly what I'd want a gerrymander to do.",
  "A -- a minority who was a majority.",
  "I'm not sure that Justice Stevens is suggesting that as a standard. He's suggesting it as a disqualifier. If it's not as compact, it's no good, but if it is as compact, he's -- I -- I don't think he's suggesting it's okay. So we still don't have a standard.",
  "A safe harbor from an unknown standard.",
  "When you're carved out of a couple of preceding districts, which is the preceding district? I mean, isn't -- isn't that a problem with that test?",
  "Suppose I point the finger in an affidavit, and I just send the affidavit, you know. I -- I don't want to get involved. I'm in a foreign country. I sign my name. I even do it under oath, and I send it right to the judge that's trying the case, not to a law enforcement officer, to the judge. You don't think the Confrontation Clause would cover that?",
  "So your -- your thesis that it applies to just accusatory statements to a law enforcement officer has to be expanded a little.",
  "What was she calling 911 for if she didn't want help?",
  "I mean, she -- she wanted something from 911. What did she -- what did she want? Did she want the police to come over and arrest her husband? Was that -- or --",
  "You say according to your reading of the cases, but you really don't have a case like this. You -- you have a case where, after the fact, the -- the victim went to a constable or to some other official to report the event, and perhaps to seek help against the person who -- but you don't have anything where really, in the course -- in the course of the attack or -- or while the person is still at least under threat, a -- a constable is -- is called, do you?",
  "You could have -- you could have somebody walking by -- a policeman walking by outside.",
  "And the victim shouting, you know, please, somebody help me, Harry is beating me. You don't have a case like that. So -- so I don't know why we should flop one side rather than the other on this -- on this case that -- that doesn't seem covered by -- by the old jurisprudence. Why should we go your way on it and say that it -- it falls within the prohibition rather than say it falls outside the prohibition?",
  "Yes, but that's not this case.",
  "That --",
  "Because of the -- because of the Confrontation Clause you think?",
  "Well, I assume the defendant could summon that -- that witness if -- if that witness' location was known. No?",
  "And could find out from the prosecution where that witness was, I assume.",
  "Maybe we should just -- just suspend the Confrontation Clause in spousal abuse cases instead of designing the entire application of the Confrontation Clause everywhere on the basis of what seems to be a special problem in spousal abuse cases.",
  "I understand.",
  "And I suppose we could also have said that the Sixth Amendment, like some other amendments, doesn't apply to State prosecutions --",
  "-- or the Confrontation Clause portion of it, anyway --",
  "-- which would exempt spousal abuse cases, by and large, until we -- until we enact a Federal spousal abuse statute, which -- which may well occur. It seems to me there -- there are better ways to -- to solve this problem than to design the whole Confrontation Clause jurisprudence on the basis of what happens in spousal abuse cases.",
  "Like what is his name? I mean, that's the present tense. Not what was his name or what will be his name. What is his name? You think that's the present tense. So that shows that this is all seeking help.",
  "You know, powerful is part of the problem. This -- this kind of telephone call evidence is even more powerful than -- than the kind of a signed affidavit that used to be banned because it was testimonial. I mean, to hear -- to hear the voice on the phone makes it, if it is -- if it is impermissible under the Confrontation Clause, it makes it even a more damaging violation than the kind of violation that -- that occurred in -- in Sir Walter Raleigh's case, for example.",
  "Would you -- would you rather put the woman on -- if you had a choice, would you rather put the woman on the stand?",
  "Rather than have her -- her voice on the telephone call --",
  "-- when she is -- she is in -- in -- supposedly in great fear of -- of her husband and -- and -- I'm sure you'd rather have the telephone call.",
  "As a prosecutor.",
  "I think it would be an easy choice.",
  "Let's -- let's not overread Crawford. Crawford didn't say that the only thing the Confrontation Clause was directed at was the kind of abuse that -- that occurred in the case of Sir Walter Raleigh. It said that that was the principal abuse at which it was directed. I doubt very much, unless you think otherwise, that if somebody, without provocation from the police, wrote up an affidavit, signed the affidavit, and gave it to the police, I doubt whether that would have been allowed under the Confrontation Clause. Do you think it would have?",
  "Your test wouldn't cover the example I just gave.",
  "And you think that that should be admissible in a criminal trial?",
  "Well --",
  "Oh, now the person disappears afterwards, is unavailable.",
  "I can't imagine that that wouldn't have been covered by the Confrontation Clause --",
  "-- such -- such an obvious violation of your right to confront your accuser, and just because it was presented to the police without -- without an initial interrogation by the police, I don't think that would have made any difference at common law.",
  "I agree that that's the extreme, but you're urging us to -- to adopt a test that embraces only the extreme and does not embrace the hypothetical I just gave you. And you -- you can accept that hypothetical without saying that you lose this case, but it seems to me the test you're proposing is -- is really quite extreme.",
  "What -- what do we do about the -- about the fact, which I don't think you -- you deny and -- and the -- the other side points out in both of these cases that, in fact, police departments have their responders to the 911 number intentionally ask a series of questions that gives them all the information they need to conduct a prosecution? In other words, they are using 911 as a -- as a prosecutorial device.",
  "Disappearing. Not just not appearing. Disappearing.",
  "Well, the husband had left the house here, as I understand it, when this -- when this call occurred.",
  "She -- she wanted the man arrested, but he was no longer in the house, was he?",
  "What do you mean by seeking help? I mean, it seems to me you're saying seeking help means trying to get somebody arrested, trying to get somebody who has harmed you arrested. In this case, he was gone out of the house. She had gone and locked the door before she came back to the phone and gave most of this testimony.",
  "And -- and in the -- in the jeweler case, the guy is running down the street. What is the jeweler -- is the jeweler really worried about the guy turning around and coming back to rob some more? He wants the man arrested.",
  "Well, it's -- it's -- it may be not a lot, but it's something. You don't have anything to the contrary.",
  "You don't have anything which shows that these hue and cry reports were admitted, and there were a lot of them. They -- they were done regularly.",
  "I would say that a hue and cry report is not the same as a woman being beaten and -- and picking up the phone while the crime is in progress. But I think it's quite similar to the -- the jewelry hypothetical that Justice Kennedy gave you which you're unwilling to say is -- is not covered by the -- is covered by the Confrontation Clause, and I think it's quite similar to a woman, where the husband has left and she's locked the door and she wants the husband arrested. I think it's quite similar to that. But for the telephone, it's -- it's someone who's been the victim of a crime who goes to a public official, as soon as possible, and says, I've been -- I've been subject to a crime. I want to report the crime and have the person arrested. I think it's very similar.",
  "And you wouldn't say that every question asked in that context. Don't we have to do it question by question? I mean, what if one of the questions was, you know, has he beaten you before? How many times before? You know, are you going to allow that in too --",
  "-- as an excited utterance?",
  "Statutes that -- that say what?",
  "Yes. We -- we -- that -- that quotation was a -- a description of what Crawford described as the core.",
  "Not -- not the totality of --",
  "Well, you -- you have to assume not only that the victim is unwilling or reluctant to testify, you have to assume that the victim has disappeared because the victim, unwilling or not, could be subpoenaed. Isn't that right?",
  "Right, but I'm saying the scope of the problem is -- is much more narrow than what is suggested by simply describing how often it is that the -- that the complaining witness is reluctant to testify. That doesn't stop anything.",
  "Reluctant or not, that witness can be -- can be subpoenaed.",
  "Your point, I thought, was that that would be the incentive for --",
  "-- for police departments, of course --",
  "-- if they want to make their cases.",
  "I should hope not. I mean --",
  "Edmund Burke say that?",
  "Well, you wouldn't have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, would you?",
  "This is -- this is a pretrial hearing on whether the -- the -- there's been intimidation. Couldn't the judge just find it more likely than not that the defendant has intimidated a witness?",
  "Or a 911 operator who was an agent of -- of the police.",
  "She's sitting down at -- at a table, as I recall it, with the -- with the police officer on the other side of the table.",
  "Has a cup of coffee.",
  "I thought there was a cup of coffee, too. Maybe -- I don't know where I got that from. Maybe I made it up.",
  "It didn't seem to me a terribly emergency situation in -- in that kind of a context.",
  "At the time, the officer is right there in the house. There's certainly no emergency at the time. Now, you could say that -- that the woman is frightened about a recurrence, but if -- if that's your definition of an emergency, it's going to cover an awful lot of situations.",
  "Well, I'm not sure that that was the only concern of the Founders, I mean, the -- the -- you know, the -- the fact that -- that the State could corrupt the -- the statement through the interrogation. I'm not sure that was the only concern. I -- I think the Founders believed in a judicial system, at least in criminal cases, where the person has a right to cross examine his accuser. Whether the fact that the -- I am -- I'll put it this way. I am quite sure that it would have been held a violation of the Confrontation Clause if, as the prior example I gave, someone wrote out an affidavit and sent it directly to the court, no intervening police interrogation at all, just wrote out an affidavit from -- from France, mailed it to the court, and the court has this affidavit. I am sure that would be a smack-bang violation of the Confrontation Clause. And there's none of the -- the abuse that -- on -- on which you -- you would hinge the entirety of the violation.",
  "Before you leave that, surely the affidavit isn't -- isn't what's magical. I mean, I'm going to change my hypothetical. The person recites his accusation on a tape recorder and mails the tape to the court. Now, are you going to say, well, it's not an affidavit? You'd exclude that as well, wouldn't you?",
  "That would make no sense at all. I mean, that -- that is just the worst sort of formalism. If you do it in an affidavit, it's -- it's bad, but if you put it on a tape, it's -- it's good. I -- I cannot understand any reason for that.",
  "Well, let's assume your -- you have here a woman who's sitting down in the kitchen with the police officer, talks to the police officer, and then signs an affidavit. Did she sign the affidavit at that time?",
  "And that affidavit was not admissible because it's an affidavit.",
  "But the police officer who testified to what she said and what he wrote down in the affidavit that she signed, that does get in.",
  "I -- I can't see why that makes any sense at all. I mean, she -- she was either testifying when she spoke and then signed the affidavit, as evidence of her testimony, or -- or else she wasn't testifying, in which case both the affidavit and the oral statement should be in. I can't -- I can't see drawing the line between those two. It really seems very strange to me.",
  "Why does his motive matter? I mean, the -- the issue is whether she is testifying, whether she is a witness, and I don't see how that changes when she tells him these things orally and when she signs the affidavit afterwards. It seems to me she's testifying as to what events had occurred.",
  "What was the immediate danger?",
  "I mean, there's the policeman in the room across the kitchen table from -- from the woman.",
  "He's not on the end of a phone line. He's in the room across the kitchen table.",
  "That -- that assumes -- this -- your -- your focus on whether the -- you know, the -- it's an interrogation or not -- it -- it assumes that the only focus of the Confrontation Clause is on prosecutorial abuse somehow. And -- and as -- as Justice Souter was suggesting, I don't think that was the exclusive --",
  "As it happens in the other -- in the companion case today, the prosecution itself, in its summation to the jury, referred to the 911 call and said, you have heard the testimony of -- of the victim and referred to it as testimony.",
  "I mean, it's not beyond the pale to consider this testimony.",
  "No, but it would prove that -- that it's not beyond the pale to call it testimony.",
  "I'm not sure that the two were -- were as separated as you -- as you claim. I -- I took it that the affidavit -- while he was getting the oral responses, he was writing down what -- what would be put in the affidavit.",
  "Well, that's the difference, not the lack of public interest --",
  "-- that you're --",
  "-- pointing to, is that in one case he is making this statement as an employee; and you say the employer, if it's a stupid statement, ought to be able to fire him for it. In --",
  "-- the other case, he's making the statement as a member of the public. And stupid statements to be made. Right?",
  "Or he could go public, I assume. He could say, \"I got fired for saying this. And this was true.\" Right? Take it to the press. The press would love it.",
  "Right?",
  "I'm assuming it was --",
  "-- not required to be kept confidential.",
  "Well, sure you'd agree with that, if it's his duty to call it or -- just as it's the duty of a -- of a lawyer not to lie to the court. If there was a similarly clear legal duty for him to say something, you'd say that was part of his job description, right?",
  "Of course, if --",
  "-- if you adopt a principle that every employee ought to -- ought to report to his superiors known wrongdoing by his co-workers, and that that's part of his job duties, you -- then you always cut off the ability of that employee to go public, right? I mean, that's a -- sort of an expanding category, \"job duties.\" duties, things that normally the employer would take into consideration for things like terminating or I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.",
  "Well, why --",
  "Go on. I'll let --",
  "-- let's hear your --",
  "Well --",
  "Because public employee left in the country. I mean, really. protect employees against things of this sort?",
  "No, but neither should a superior be required to get a report from a subordinate that he thinks is way off base, just a result of poor judgment, thinking that there -- that there was a violation here, when there -- when there obviously wasn't, or using facts that were not sufficiently established in order to claim such a violation. Surely, the employer is entitled to say, \"On the basis of this report, which you gave me, you're fired.\"",
  "But that'll --",
  "-- always be --",
  "-- \"for this or that.\" I mean --",
  "-- that's not -- that's not established. That's not established at all. His supervisor obviously thought he didn't --",
  "Yes, but it's a very serious allegation for somebody who's in the position that this employee was to make against police officers. And as I understood the case, the supervisor said, \"Wow, I don't want loose cannons around down there who are accusing perfectly honest and respectable police officers of violating the law.\" Now, that --",
  "-- hasn't been proven, either. But --",
  "But that is certainly a possibility. And I do not want to exclude the ability of a supervisor to fire somebody, if that possibility litigation.",
  "The First Amendment value may be the same, but it -- but what is present is another value. And unless the person is willing to go public, in which case the balancing occurs, and assuming there's no prohibition of it, that other value is a very significant one, the ability of public officials to run their offices.",
  "Cases involving those questions would have to go to the courts, I assume. But they'd be a small percentage of all the cases that would go to the courts if we adopt your position. I agree, there will still be some cases left that'll have to go to the courts to sort out these questions that you mentioned. But that's going to be a small percentage of the totality.",
  "-- because it's been unclear, until this Court has spoken to the subject, and especially in light of the dicta in our prior cases, which says that he has to be speaking publicly. The reason for the -- for the -- for the paucity of cases can be, simply, that the law was not clear, and most people thought the way -- the way your opponent in this case thinks.",
  "Yes, but the Court didn't say this guy had blue eyes.",
  "It said he was speaking as a -- that seemed to the Court to be important to its decision.",
  "Ms. Lee --",
  "-- what do you respond to the argument that this has been the law in a number of Circuits and the sky has not fallen?",
  "Let's examine them. What if it definitely goes so far as to allow no other use of this natural law that it's discovered? It definitely goes that far, isn't definiteness fully satisfied?",
  "No?",
  "I could see how that broad interpretation would raise perhaps for the -- clearly raise for the first time the section 101 issue. But, so that should have been clear to you by the time the court of appeals decision came out, right? But did you, in your petition here, rely on 101?",
  "You never mentioned 101, though, did you?",
  "Why shouldn't we do what the Solicitor General proposed, that is, since we don't know for sure, at least I don't know for sure, I'm not enough of a scientist --",
  "-- whether in fact the section 112 determination, as made by the Federal court, excludes all other possible use of this natural phenomenon. Since I don't know that for sure, why shouldn't I tell the Federal Circuit, you know, your definition of correlate raises this issue and you should resolve whether it is true that there is no other possible usefulness for this, no substantial usefulness?",
  "Okay.",
  "You're too hungry, Mr. Estrada.",
  "What was made by man here? What was made by man here? I mean, if you're talking about the type of assay that your client developed, which was involved in other claims, not in 13, then I'd say, yes, that was made by man. But here, what 13 involves is simply discovery of the natural principle that when one, when there is the presence of one substance in a human being, there is a deficiency of two other ones. That's just a natural principle. What's made by man about that?",
  "A way found elsewhere if indeed the Federal Circuit had determined the second step, you know, step 1, do the assay, step 2, correlate. If the Federal Circuit had said, oh, that requires your using a scale to see how much of one there is and how little of the other, but this Federal Circuit says, all correlate means is be aware of the fact that when one substance is high, the other two are going to be low. That's all it means.",
  "No, please don't get off it -- because this is my biggest problem with the case. I agree that what you've said is simply a statement of the natural phenomenon, that when the one substance is high, the other two are low. And simply to be aware of that natural phenomenon is all that correlation consists of.",
  "You mean life isn't a fountain?",
  "Where -- where is the unomitted language? What -- what page of the brief are you quoting from?",
  "Now, ERISA -- ERISA makes it very clear that -- that a plan to pay insurance for employee benefits, whether it's disability or retirement or whatever else, is an employee benefit plan and -- and explicitly excludes workmen's comp because otherwise it would fall within that definition of an employee benefit plan.",
  "I know that's a different statute. I'm not saying that the -- that the definitions of that statute have to apply here, but the definitions of that statute at least demonstrate that it is a permissible use of the -- of -- of the term employee benefit plan.",
  "All right. Tell me why.",
  "Before you -- before you go on, could you satisfy a curiosity of mine? Maybe Mr. Verrilli should be the one I should ask this, but you must have your -- your version of it. How do you decide whether an insurance premium is for work that was done within the last 180 days? How -- how do you calculate it, whether that characteristic of the -- of the statute is complied with?",
  "Oh, if it said premiums due within the last 180 days, I could understand it --",
  "Or else establish that there's no conceivable way that 180 days makes any sense.",
  "We're together on this.",
  "The -- the correlative hypothetical would be a plan such as Justice Breyer describes in which the employer has contracted to pay his employees $200 a month for when they're sick, and that's a contractual obligation of his, and then he buys insurance to cover that contractual obligation.",
  "Where does (a)(3) appear? There -- there was that discussion in your brief, and I'm darned if I could find (a)(3).",
  "Well, it would have been nice to have it in your brief --",
  "-- and numbered -- numbered 3 instead of 4. That would have helped a lot.",
  "You're begging the question by calling it a plan. I mean, that -- that's -- that's one of the issues here. Why don't you tell us what workmen compensation laws require?",
  "What's your answer to the 180 days question I answered -- I asked? You know, the provision provides contributions. It doesn't say just contributions to an employee benefit plan. It says contributions to an employee benefit plan arising from services rendered, and then it goes on to say, but -- but the services have to be within the last 180 days.",
  "How do you square that with -- with the purchase of block insurance like this?",
  "But each of those insurance premiums that's paid by the employer doesn't just cover workers who've worked for the last 180 days. Each premium is divided among all the workers who've been working there for years. Some of the premiums are going to go to -- to allow the insurance company to pay in the future people who have been there for 20 years.",
  "I mean, it just seems to me it's a square peg in a round hole. I -- I don't see how you make sense out of that 180 --",
  "You really think that -- that they cut it that fine? They say, oh, yes, this guy is going to go into bankruptcy. We're pretty sure about that, but don't worry. We'll have priority.",
  "I think as soon as they smell bankruptcy, they're going to pull the plug anyway.",
  "It has to be arising from services rendered. I mean, it -- it really has to be part of the contract with the employer --",
  "Mr. Verrilli, what -- what is your response to Mr. Strain's assertion that if you get a priority, so should the secondary insurer, that is, the -- the bank that gave letters of credit? They're just insuring -- that -- that's part of the plan too. They couldn't have gotten the insurance from you unless they got the letters of -- of credit from the bank, which is a kind of secondary insurance. And also in the case of self-insurance, which is something of a plan -- I -- I guess you'd call it a plan -- what about the -- the person who puts up the bond? That person is a kind of insurer, just as you are. Do all of these people now -- now get bumped up to the head of the line?",
  "Where -- where does that appear?",
  "Yes, because it's not in the briefs --",
  "-- just -- just as the contract isn't before us.",
  "How do we know what you've just told us? Is that in the record? You're just assuring us what the content of the insurance contract is. Right? But we don't have the insurance contract.",
  "So we -- we have your assurance that that's what happens here.",
  "Well, it has to be that way? I could write a contract differently.",
  "That's a --",
  "But it's not just to those. It's to a lot of other people. I mean, that's --",
  "Well, except the workers who had already been injured in the past --",
  "-- and -- and whom you continue to pay. Right?",
  "Right.",
  "And I assume that each of your premiums takes into account the fact that you're not only going to be paying for people, you know, who were injured between the last premium and now, but that you're also going to be paying for people who were injured a long time ago.",
  "But why should that --",
  "-- why should that make a difference as to whether it's retroactive or not? I mean, if it -- it seems to me you look to the activity that it governs. And the activity that it governs is the deportation or removal from now on. Now, you could argue that -- if you want, that there are some due process violations in making that prospective law affect past activities as they do. I mean, let's -- one of the examples given in Landgraf, or at least in my concurrence in Landgraf, was a change of the law procedure so that expert testimony, which previously was not admissible, is now admissible. Now, the person who committed the crime that's involved in the next case that comes up when that new procedural rule is applied, he can say, \"Well, you know, you've changed -- you've changed the rules on me. When I committed the crime, the expert testimony wasn't admissible. Now it is admissible. That's not fair.\" Well, whether it's fair or not is something we can inquire into under the due process clause, but nobody would say that that procedural change is retroactive. And it --",
  "-- seems to me that's what's going on here.",
  "That wasn't my point. My point --",
  "-- was, you look to the -- to the activity which is governed by the new law. In the case of the -- of the expert testimony, the activity governed is the trial, so that law applies prospectively to all future trials. So, also, in this case, this law applies prospectively to all future removals, QED. It is not retroactive. Now, you may have an argument, although I don't think it's a very good one, that there are due process problems involved in this prospective law. But I don't see how you can call the law retroactive.",
  "That doesn't affect --",
  "-- doesn't affect his reentry at all. His reentry occurred. It -- how could it possibly have anything to do with his reentry?",
  "That would apply new penalties to the reentry. This law does not apply any new penalties to the reentry, it just -- it just establishes a new regime for removing the person who has reentered.",
  "Yes, but --",
  "-- I think that's because they were using the version of stage one that you are using, which includes, in the consideration of whether Congress has been clear, an inquiry into whether the -- whether the law is retroactive or not, which, as I understand it, should be left to stage two, exclusively.",
  "Your analysis in your brief mingles the two. It says one of the factors that you can take into account in stage one is whether it's retroactive. And as I -- I don't understand Landgraf to speak that way. I thought you were supposed to use all other indicia of legislative intent, other than the normal rule against retroactivity, in deciding congressional intent, and then you go to stage two, which is where retroactivity comes in.",
  "Yes, but as the Government points out, that \"either before or after\" applied to when you had been deported --",
  "-- not to when you reentered. And what we're -- what you're arguing for here is a rule that goes from the time of reentry, not from the time of deportation. So, it's not really a parallel.",
  "I wish we could get some new vocabulary. Terminology is destiny, and I really don't follow the discussion of speaking about whether it was prospective or retroactive. I don't think, whichever way it applied, it is retroactive. But the issue still remains, Did Congress intend pre-IIRIRA reentries to be covered or not? I --",
  "-- I would consider that still prospective, but just note my --",
  "-- that I don't --",
  "-- go along with you when you force this terminology on me, whether Congress intended it to be retroactive. As I see it, the issue is whether Congress intended it to apply to reentries that occurred before IIRIRA was enacted. I would not consider that retroactive, but it's still an open question what Congress intended.",
  "Why would -- I find it difficult to understand why Congress wouldn't have wanted this to apply to illegal entrants who had come in before IIRIRA. Bear in mind, these are people who have been deported once, already deported once, and then, in violation of the law, come back in again. And there was a regime for deporting them, which allowed certain variations, which are eliminated by IIRIRA, permission for them to stay. You really think Congress wanted to keep faith with the people who had, already have -- having been deported once for illegal reentry - - illegal entry -- come in again -- and you think Congress says, \"Oh, well, you know, we have to keep faith with these people who are violating our law, and not -- and not deport them except under the conditions that existed when they broke the law to reenter\"? I find that a very -- what should I say? -- touching --",
  "-- attitude for Congress to have.",
  "Not only the --",
  "-- disincentives.",
  "They were trying to get out of the country people who were here illegally, two-time losers who were here illegally for the second time.",
  "Why would he think that? Why wouldn't he just think, being here illegally, he is subject to being deported under such rules as the country has for deporting people who are here illegally, whatever they may be, from time to time? That would be my expectation if I came in illegally, in violation of the law. I'm saying, \"I'm here at the sufferance of the country. I shouldn't be here. And whatever rules they have for kicking me out are the rules that I'll have to abide by.\"",
  "\"I'm lucky not to be in jail.\"",
  "And those --",
  "And those provisions are specifically recited to apply only to reentrants after the effective date.",
  "You don't want to --",
  "You don't want us to decide it on that ground, do you, so that all future cases you'll have to decide whether he came in before '94 or after '94, right?",
  "Did you say '84 or '94? I couldn't --",
  "All right.",
  "Can't imagine that.",
  "I say, I cannot imagine that. No.",

  "Just as he doesn't automatically get admitted because he's married, does he?",

  "So, it's --",
  "-- one discretion --",
  "-- and another discretion.",
  "Or, put more starkly, if I continue to violate the law for 7 years, I can count on this kind of treatment. That's an odd reliance interest.",
  "I'm not sure that gives the other side the -- you know, the benefit of their argument. I think what they're arguing is not just that it was deleted, but that it was not replaced by -- whether \"before or after,\" and then filling in the date of IIRIRA, rather than the date of the INA. I have -- nobody thinks that they would leave in June 27, 1952, but why wouldn't they have substituted, for that, the date of this new legislation, the date of IIRIRA? I think that's the point he's making.",

  "Conceivably, if it's too short, it's not reasonably available. I guess --",
  "Okay.",
  "It's conceivable.",
  "I would -- I would not describe \"exhaustion\" that way. I would -- I would describe a failure to file within the prescribed time, not as an exhaustion of remedies, but as a failure to exhaust remedies. I mean, I guess I'm having a terminological problem in this case, as I did in the previous case.",
  "Yes, well, we're talking about administrative law, which is a field I used to know something about, and I've never thought \"exhaustion\" included \"failure to exhaust,\" which --",
  "-- which is --",
  "-- what happens when you simply don't file within the prescribed period.",
  "But how does it do that? I mean, if there's any object that Congress had in mind, surely it was to reduce the number of frivolous prisoner claims that are coming into Federal district courts. And it hoped to do this by sending the -- making sure that they went through the prison system first. Whether we looked at what the prison system did or not, we hoped that the prison system would get rid of a large -- a large number of these frivolous claims. Now, can you tell me how that purpose is possibly served --",
  "-- by saying, \"Do nothing. So long as you don't even try to go through the prison grievance system, you can come directly into court.\" It seems to me this --",
  "-- this --",
  "Oh, no, \"You -- you have to go there late. You\" --",
  "-- \"you just sit around until it's too late, file a grievance that you know will not be accepted, because it's too late, and then you can come into Federal Court.\" This is going to cut back considerably on the number of frivolous claims?",
  "Maybe because they thought they had to file on time.",
  "And the more frivolous the case, the more likely it is that it won't be remembered by a guard. I mean, you know, the suit is, \"A guard spat on my painting,\" or something like that, you know. Who's going to remember anything like that 4 months later?",
  "It seems to me you're understating the amount of time that he's saving by failing to exhaust. It's not just if he waits six months and then puts it in. If he had filed within the right period, he would get a hearing at one level. And there may be as many as two other levels of review before he's fully off -- before he's fully exhausted. Now, here's a guy who -- you know, he's lying around in jail. He's -- this is a frivolous filer. He wants to get out of the jail, downtown, you know, to the district court in L.A., where he can look at the beautiful people and relieve the humdrum of prison life. He wants to get to district court as soon as he can.",
  "Why is that procedural rule binding on him, but the time procedural rule not binding on him? I don't know why. I mean, if --",

You're saying you would apply the same directness test. there is -- Justice Scalia, I don't want -- I don't think that it should be foreclosed that as your opinion in Holmes and as footnote 20 of the majority opinion in Holmes pointed out, how those proximate cause factors get analyzed with the different predicate acts may vary slightly, but we think --",

  "Okay. Then we're back in the soup.",
  "Gee, I -- I find that extraordinary that -- I claim to have been defrauded by somebody. He makes a representation to me about the value of stock. I don't believe it.

  "Where was that change made from the prior version?",
  "Yes, but, I mean, what -- it was made in what house? Was it made by the conference committee?",
  "It was made in the Senate. So the House presumably never saw the prior --",

  "Well, when you say Congress hasn't fairly balanced it, I mean, I guess that depends upon your reading of the statute.

  "I mean, it's sort of a -- you know, a -- you're running in a circle.",
  "As I recall the Sixth Amendment, you're entitled to know the charge against you. And you're saying that the charge of conspiracy is not the charge of aiding and abetting.",

  "Well, I mean, not ad hoc in that sense, \"I'm creating one court for this defendant, another court for the other defendant,\" but setting up for the occasion, and for trying numerous defendants, a new court. I don't think that, just because it's a new court, you can say that it's not a \"regularly constituted court.\"",
  "I thought --",
  "I thought we -- I thought we established, earlier -- somebody told me -- that, in the normal criminal suit, even if you claim that the forum is not properly constituted, that claim is not adjudicated immediately, it's adjudicated at the conclusion of the proceeding.",

  "Mr. Stris, I'd -- I'd like to know what -- what you make of our opinion in Barnes v. Alexander. It's an old case but it involved a situation similar to this, namely, a contingent fee arrangement with a lawyer, and the client received all the money, without giving the lawyer his contingent fee. We reasoned in our opinion that, quote, the contract for a contingent fee out of a fund awarded constituted a lien upon the fund and that, quote, it is one of the familiar rules in equity that a contract to convey a specific object, even before it is acquired, title to the thing. Why doesn't that absolutely resolve the present case? case, Justice Scalia, because the -- MAMSI's interpretation of the Barnes line of cases, the equitable lien by assignment cases, would entirely negate the limitation that Congress put into 502(a)(3). And -- and if you'd permit me to explain why. A remedy of an equitable lien by assignment, as we explained in our opening brief, is not a restitutionary remedy. No unjust enrichment need be proved. No tracing need be proved. It's purely a contractual remedy. Now, as a result, courts of equity historically developed this remedy to give priority to one creditor over another if there was a present intent on the part of the promisor to pledge that specific property as security.",
  "But we -- but, you know, our opinions haven't said only certain kinds of equitable relief, only restitutionary equitable relief. We've simply said whether equitable relief would normally be available. And now you're -- you're trying to rewrite our cases to say that only certain types of equitable",
  "And -- and if, indeed, it That's the way Congress wrote the statute.",
  "What -- I don't understand what difference that makes. I mean, in both cases there was a commitment to pay the contingent fee. It was a promise. And when the money was collected, the court said, we're going to enforce an equitable lien",
  "Take it. Take it. It's a good one. Right.",
  "Why -- why isn't that what occurred here? What -- what's the essential",
  "Well, but I mean, once you get out of the contract terms and are trying to make your case on the basis of subrogation, you do have to show that -- that part of the recovery was -- was for the -- for the medical expenses. And has that been shown?",
  "You -- you have piqued my are variations on make-whole. What -- you were about to describe the variations. What are the variations? the -- the most stringent is Petitioners' rule, which is we have to be made whole for everything that we wanted to claim, pain and suffering. We thought our claim was $1 million and we didn't settle for $1 million, and therefore, we're not made whole. There is -- there is another version that is less restrictive than that, but as long as there is a showing that medical expenses have been paid, you get a return of medical expenses. There are another version -- there's another version that is enforced in many States, including Virginia and California and I -- some others I believe, in which essentially the make-whole runs the other way towards the insurer, that -- that you have basically a first dollar type to ensure that the medical expenses are paid first. There are -- there are a variety of things, but within the ERISA context, every court of appeals that has addressed this has said that when you put these kinds of terms into the plan -- and they are very common -- we're not going to adopt from various States plan and that will --",
  "I should think your response is that Congress provided for only equitable relief.",

  "And not being a common law court, it's not bound by its own prior decisions, is it?",

  "What -- what remedies have other countries provided for -- for these rights? I mean, it's -- it's easy to say the right exists. What -- what have other countries done by way of vindicating these rights?",
  "I mean, advising them of them is -- is really not vindicating them, it doesn't seem to me.",
  "Well, that's -- but, you know, that's what the other side said the whole thing should consist of, that it's a matter to be enforced by -- by state-to-state protests, not -- not by the judicial system or the legal system taking it upon itself to provide a remedy. What -- what remedies have been provided in -- in other countries? You -- you mentioned an exclusion in Australia?",
  "When -- when was that?",
  "Well, it's a source of authority but not a source of authority for suppression. And I find it implausible that we signed a treaty which requires us to suppress evidence of this sort, but allows the other treaty partners to do whatever they like, not -- not suppress, let it in, rely upon consular protests. Is -- is that what this provision, you know, in accordance with domestic law, means, that -- you know, each man to himself?",
  "That may give you a warmer feeling inside, but do you think that the foreign consulate is -- is more likely to give you good advice about what you should do under American law than an American lawyer that you've been provided?",
  "Yes, but I'm just saying whether it makes any difference. I mean, you're talking about anything that -- that affects substantive rights. He's been provided an attorney who knows American law better, presumably, than -- than a consular official.

  "Well, it -- it just makes me think that -- that instant contact is not what was envisioned by the treaty.",
  "Can I come back to the conflict of interest? Was -- was this lawyer a compensated lawyer, or was he a public defender?",
  "He was retained.",
  "By whom?",
  "What about that Australian case that was mentioned, I believe one case where they say --",

If somebody makes a statue out of stolen gold, you know, the -- the old classic, I guess you'd get the money back. But ordinarily we're talking about a property right here, and -- and the property right is -- is explicitly the right to exclude others from -- from use of that. That's what the patent right is. And all he's asking for is give me my property back.",
  "You know, I mean, that's -- patent law. I mean, maybe -- maybe we should remedy that problem.",
  "But I don't think we should write -- write our patent law because we have some renegade jurisdictions.

  "Why can't -- why can't we let the market take care of the problem?",
  "I think maybe you exaggerate wasn't as though it's just left up to the judge, seems like a good idea or not a good idea.

  "By not occupying it, you mean including not licensing it to somebody else.",
  "When you say going forward, I thought we were talking about damages for the past violation, not damages for future violations which will continue. Are we talking about that too?",
  "About the court effectively saying, yes, here pay him and -- and go on and skip away and continue violating it.",
  "In this case, they -- they just talking about, you know, the -- the past actions should -- should be compensable by damages and not -- injunction.",
  "Which -- when they will be calculable. You're saying it's hard to calculate them into the future.

  "That's a curiosity. It is.",
  "And the issue would be, I assume, how much a reasonable person likes a free lunch.",
  "But -- but are you? I'm -- I'm a little concerned that -- that you're trying to persuade us to interpret 704 the same as 703 at the expense of watering down 703. I don't understand how you can concede that -- that refusing to invite somebody to lunch, if it's more than -- more than a single lunch, could be a violation of 703.

  "-- it's not official just -- just because it was decreed by a -- you know, a track boss or something. It -- it was an action of the company because the company cut -- cut off her pay for 2 weeks. Right?",
  "No. That's his point. I mean, that's his point, that -- that the one way to avoid the problem is to keep shifting people around.",
  "I don't know if that hurts you or helps you. I mean, that -- that eliminates what seems to me is the strongest argument of the -- of your side, which is that it makes no sense to impose greater sanctions upon somebody who -- who files a complaint than it does upon somebody who -- who violates somebody's race, religion, or whatever by -- by discriminating.",
  "You're telling me it does make sense, that we've done it in other areas.",
  "I'm -- I'm a supervisor, and the employee files a complaint against me as a supervisor. Thereafter, I am not as friendly to that employee as I used to be. I don't smile and say, good morning, how are you, as I used to. All right?",
  "And you wouldn't expect me to. This person has, you know, hauled me onto the block. Now, am -- am I discriminating against that person?",
  "I'm not? I'm not treating her the way I did before.",
  "Sort of like taking her to lunch.",
  "Now, you say it -- it has to be part of my -- it doesn't have to relate to her terms and conditions of employment, you say --",
  "-- because it's not the same as 703. But somehow you say it -- it has to. Does it have to or not have to?",
  "Yes, I worry about that, as -- as varied as the human imagination. Juries can have wonderful imaginations. I mean, that -- that is the problem. Is it meant to be this -- this uncontrolled, this uncabined?",
  "What -- what is your criterion that is going to stop every little thing from -- from being deemed a retaliatory measure, such as not saying good morning to this employee?",
  "Yes, I understand that. But almost any act of his subordinates will be deemed act of the -- of the employer where retaliation is concerned, I'll bet you. What else besides that?",
  "I'll give you causation. But I'm talking about the triviality -- the triviality of the action in question. Is there no test that eliminates a trivial action from the aggrieved employee who -- who wants to litigate?",
  "A reasonable person would what -- would what?",
  "A reasonable person would consider it to be?",
  "Adverse.",
  "Why is the EEOC standard any more based in the text of the statute than -- than the standard proposed by your adversary here?",
  "Suppose -- suppose I disagree with you as to the standard, that is, I think 704 and 703 both require something related to the employment. Would -- what would the outcome be? Would -- would the case have to go back to be submitted to the jury under that standard? What standard did the jury find --",
  "Well, that isn't the test, I mean, whether you can convince a jury. I think you -- you have to acknowledge that -- that before we -- we say that these trial instructions were adequate to -- to give you your victory, we -- we have to find that at least a reasonable jury could conclude under section 703 that -- that both of these -- both of these adverse actions qualified as discrimination under 703, if -- if we're going to use that test. Right? You acknowledge that.",
  "Okay, but that -- that is at least what -- what's before us here, that if -- if we go the 703 equals 704 route, we would have to conclude, in order to affirm here, that a reasonable jury could find. This jury did, but we'd have to find that that's reasonable. Right?",
  "Yes, and the other argument is that if you don't do it, there's no way to -- to get a case dismissed before it goes to a jury. You're saying every claim is going to be a jury trial. I mean, that -- you know, come on.",
  "But the triviality issue would be out of the case. No matter how trivial, it goes to a jury. That's -- that's what you want us to say.",
  "Well, then we have to have some per se rules.",
  "Was deadly weapon still an enhancement at that point, or was deadly weapon part of the definition of a new crime?",
  "Well, you -- you could -- it could be argued that it not only didn't encompass the firearm finding, but it excluded the firearm finding. If, as you tell us, there are two categories, one being deadly weapon, which does not include firearm, and the other being firearm, wouldn't you say that the jury verdict positively contradicted?",
  "The judge doesn't have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt, does he?",
  "I don't understand what -- what you meant by a facial unconstitutional -- facially unconstitutional problem. You mean a Federal court would enjoin the criminal prosecution because it's unconstitutional on its face? We wouldn't do that, would we?",
  "Neither can I.",
  "So that -- that's not really an adequate answer, that it would be facially unconstitutional.",
  "How could it be lesser included when, as we've heard, firearm does -- I'm sorry -- deadly weapon does not include firearm? If deadly weapon included firearm, then certainly -- I'm sorry -- deadly weapon would -- would -- could be a lesser included offense somehow. But the two are exclusive categories, aren't they?",
  "But if it has the capacity --",
  "Mr. Whisman, can I -- can I ask you a hypothetical which I think puts in starker form what the -- what your colleague here says this case involves? Suppose that -- that you have a statute, a murder statute, which applies to the murder of a single individual, but -- but you have another statute with a death penalty called aggravated murder. And it's a different crime and it -- it requires the -- the killing of more than one person in -- in the same -- in the same event. Let's assume a trial in which somebody came into a bank with a machine gun. Only one person came in, and five people were killed. But the prosecution only brought a prosecution for simple murder. Okay? And the jury comes back with a verdict for -- for simple murder. Certainly a judge would not be able to say, well, no jury could possibly have found simple murder here without also thinking that this person was guilty of -- of this greater offense of -- of aggravated murder and, therefore, I'm going to enter a judgment of aggravated murder. That's what the -- the defense says happened here, that there was just a verdict of -- of the lesser offense. That's all the jury found. It could have found more and maybe -- maybe in finding that, it -- it must have thought that the greater offense also existed, but it never came in with a verdict for the greater offense. Now, tell me why what happened here is different from -- from the hypothetical.",
  "When did -- when did we first hold that the State had to provide counsel if -- if the defendant could not afford his own counsel?",
  "And that's what we generally mean nowadays by the right -- by -- by the right to counsel. And when you talk about fairness being its objective, you're talking about the objective of that newly discovered right to have counsel appointed. But I don't know that fairness was the -- was the object of the original right to counsel in the -- in the Bill of Rights, which -- which only applied to -- to your ability to hire your own counsel, and if you couldn't afford counsel, you didn't get one. I hardly think that -- that fairness is the object of that.",
  "When -- when was our first holding to that effect?",
  "In the '30s. Gee, that's --",
  "-- that's hardly -- that's hardly the original purpose and meaning of the Sixth Amendment, and -- and you come here and say that its fundamental purpose is something that is only the purpose of the newly evolved Sixth Amendment and not of the original one.",
  "I don't think that's the overarching goal of the original. I think it's -- it's very fundamental, that if you have funds with which you can hire someone to speak for you, you should be able to use all of your -- I mean, your -- no. Your -- your freedom is at stake. You should be able to use all of your money to get the best spokesman for you as possible. That's the element of fairness that I think is there.",
  "But until the 1930s that element didn't exist.",
  "Until the 1930s, if you didn't have the money, you didn't have counsel.",
  "Well, excuse me. As far as the Constitution is concerned, if you didn't have the money, you didn't have counsel.",
  "So he was just disabled from -- from his first choice.",
  "The court told him you can't have the counsel you want. Go find somebody else.",
  "Did Flanagan, the case that denied mandamus on this issue -- did it assume any resolution of the question whether if -- if you can't have counsel of your choice, in order to get your conviction reversed, you have to show -- you have to show that the error was not harmless?",
  "No, I understand, but --",
  "-- but I would certainly think that it's relevant to the question of whether you allow immediate appeal, what the consequences of not allowing immediate appeal are. If you're totally deprived of your right, you -- you might allow it and --",
  "I don't -- I don't want -- I don't want a competent lawyer. I want a lawyer who's going to get me off.",
  "I want a lawyer who will invent the Twinkie defense. I would -- I would not -- I would not consider the Twinkie defense an invention of a competent lawyer. But -- but I want a lawyer who's going to win for me. And -- and there's no way to predict what lawyer has a charming way with the jury or -- or brings in some -- some side matters that maybe shouldn't be brought in but the judge is silly enough to let them in. I want to win. And -- and the criterion for winning is not how competent is the lawyer necessarily.",
  "It's a fair trial. Nobody is saying it wasn't a fair trial, but he didn't have the lawyer he wanted. I mean, we could assure everybody a fair trial by allowing nobody to pick their lawyers and assigning lawyers to everybody. That would -- that would accomplish fair trials throughout the United States, but that's not the system we have. You're -- you're entitled to the lawyer that you want.",
  "I mean, you -- you could say the -- you could say the same thing, counsel, about his right to self-representation, that he has the right to self-representation for his defense or for his --",
  "Yes, but it is limited to the right of self-representation for his defense, just as his choice of counsel is limited to his choice of counsel for his defense.",
  "How do you think that would work with the Twinkie defense?",
  "I don't think any court would conceivably reverse the -- the disqualification of counsel on the ground that he would have come up with that defense and win.",
  "Well, I think he can also reject an appointed counsel. Can't he go to the court and say, I -- you know, I don't like this counsel?",
  "Yes, I know it happens.",
  "Or -- or my Uncle Vinnie. What about the real -- the real case of my Uncle Vinnie? There's --",
  "I don't know -- I don't know whether he was a real estate lawyer or not.",
  "Are you entitled to represent yourself on appeal?",
  "So --",
  "I'm -- I'm not sure you're properly characterizing the -- the Government's position. I mean, you -- you don't have to assert that the right is not violated until -- until there's an unfair trial in order to take the position that the Government takes. I mean, the right -- a lot of rights that are later reviewed for harmless error or for -- to see whether there was prejudice were violated at the time, and not -- not just on the basis of whether there was prejudice or not.",
  "Unless you compel him to seek mandamus on pain of losing the constitutional claim, your -- every incentive is to go right ahead with the trial.",
  "I don't think the mandamus solution works unless you compel mandamus, unless you say you lose -- you lose the claim unless you bring mandamus.",
  "How many -- how many circuits are applying that rule?",
  "The delay -- the delay was not because we can't try this man because he's incompetent, and until he's rendered competent, we -- we have to stay proceedings. That wasn't the basis at all. It was just I haven't made up my mind yet.",
  "Which is what is specifically precluded by the requirement that -- that you act within 30 days, and -- and all the rest of the time, the clock is running.",
  "And you think it's -- it's not harmless error if they didn't make the finding but -- but could have?",
  "He didn't think he needed it. He had a perpetual waiver.",
  "Mr. Zas, are you going to talk about estoppel?",
  "Well, I can. Did he ask for a perpetual waiver? I thought the way the colloquy went, the judge said, no, you know, I can't give you a waiver unless you'll -- unless you'll make it a perpetual waiver. And then he said, okay, I'll make it a perpetual waiver. Wasn't -- wasn't the -- the initiative for the perpetual waiver from -- from the court?",
  "Okay.",
  "And Gothic print, right?",
  "What -- what are you hypothesizing? That the court actually made this finding in its mind but just didn't express it? Or are you hypothesizing that the court could have made it but didn't make it, never even went through the mental process?",
  "Could have made it. So -- so we're going to -- why can't life be simple? We're going to have to have trials all the time as to whether, in this hypothetical situation, this finding could have been made. I mean, you know, this creates subsidiary litigation that we really don't need.",
  "But, you know, Congress could have -- could have written it the way -- the way you're proposing it. Congress could have said, you know, when there -- when -- when there is good cause for the continuance, the clock won't run. It didn't say that. It -- it said the judge has to make a finding. I mean, don't we have to give that some effect? You're saying it really doesn't matter whether he makes the finding or not. So long as there was good cause so that a finding could have been made, that will be enough.",
  "Except -- except where there's a public policy against what you want to estop him into doing. I mean, it seems to me for the same reason that you don't allow a waiver, you shouldn't allow an estoppel. There's a public policy against it. The -- the Congress wanted these things tried promptly, and -- and whether he merely waives or -- or goes further and affirmatively causes the court to do something which it shouldn't have done, you're just as much violating the policy it seems to me.",
  "If -- if what you say is true, I don't know why it makes any difference that the defendant led the court into it. If you -- if you believe that this is just a procedural nicety that was not complied with, why shouldn't you do the same thing when -- when the court fails to make the finding but could have made the finding whether or not the defendant was the one that led him into it?",
  "Yes, within 70 relevant days counted as the statute requires them to be counted, which includes the requirement of this finding set forth in the record before you can stop the clock running for -- you know, for some period. I don't think that that's -- I don't think that's very complicated.",
  "But it was not known at the time that he was incompetent. And -- and therefore, that could not have been the reason that he was not being tried. The reason he was not being tried was that the -- that there was pending before the judge the inquiry into whether he was competent.",
  "You really don't know the answer of whether the clock is running until the finding is made. If the -- if the judge finds that -- that he's not incompetent, well, too bad. You know, the Speedy Trial Act requires dismissal. On the other hand, if the judge finds that he is incompetent to be tried, there hasn't been a violation of the act. I mean, it's a very strange situation. And it also, as -- as the -- the other side points out, it -- it puts considerable pressure on the judge when -- when he is in violation of the Speedy Trial Act, to find that the individual is incompetent because, otherwise, there has to be a dismissal.",
  "Isn't -- isn't that so?",
  "I guess you can be -- I'm sorry, go ahead.",
  "I thought the GAO study included not just the -- the hours worked and the -- the costs, however you choose to define it, on the part of the parent challenging the school board action, but it also included those hours and those costs expended by the school.",
  "In which case it could not possibly have been directed to what items are compensable.",
  "On its face, it covers at least half of the items that are not compensable.",
  "Did Congress say that, Mr. Kuntz?",
  "Was this language, by the way -- I'm not clear. It always cited to the House -- the House conferees. Was -- was this language in the -- in the Senate conference report?",
  "So we don't really know --",
  "Well, that's only half of the Congress, isn't it? Even if --",
  "-- even if everybody in the House agreed with that, which we don't really know. What about the President? When he signed it, did -- did he indicate any interpretation?",
  "So we have a committee of one house that said -- that said that, that thought it meant that or would have liked it to mean that.",
  "They are voted on when the -- when the conferees make changes, which they sometimes do. Then -- then, of course, they have to be voted on. So it's frequent. It's frequent that they're voted on, but this one apparently -- there were no changes made and it wasn't voted on.",
  "Justice Breyer knows that. He -- he's worked there.",
  "Counsel, even in -- in those benighted days, I don't think -- I don't think we ever would use the conference report when the statute was not ambiguous. I thought it was always a rule that -- that --",
  "Before you get past Casey, Casey didn't invent this as a definition. Casey said it has always meant this in innumerable Federal statutes. Casey was relying on a longstanding practice which existed long before Casey was -- was pronounced.",
  "Not later ascribe. I mean, Casey was relying on --",
  "Mr. Vladeck, my -- my problem with the argument you're now making is -- is a little more basic. Assuming, which I think is a -- is a major assumption, that expenses refers to expert fees, I don't see how it helps your case that in another part of the statute, the statute says, fees, costs, and expenses, whereas in the operative part that we're talking about here, it only refers to fees as part of costs. How does it help your case that --",
  "-- that elsewhere they go out of their way to add and -- and expenses? It seems to me that hurts your case.",
  "Well, then where is the authorization? I think that's what Justice Alito's question goes to. You have to come up with some statutory authorization to pay expert fees. Now, attorneys' fees as part of costs does not authorize any costs. It just says whatever costs are otherwise authorized, attorneys' fees will be part of that.",
  "What is the authorization to pay costs, to pay those costs that include expert fees? All -- all this section says is they may award attorneys' fees as part of costs, and costs are presumably elsewhere authorized.",
  "But where is the authorization to pay?",
  "Do you know any State that doesn't have a cost statute?",
  "And that's effective too, as though it were written into the statute, because one committee of Congress said so. That's effective.",
  "And -- and they read it.",
  "That's the only thing we know for sure that they voted on.",
  "But was this legislation vetoed by the President?",
  "Now, when the President signed it, did -- did he also approve the conference report? Did he have the conference report in front of him?",
  "He had the statute in front of him, didn't he?",
  "You -- you think he read the conference report too.",
  "What -- what date in -- I mean, so we have two different modes of interpreting statutes: one, pre-1988 in which we use legislative history, and one post-1988 in which we don't use legislative history?",
  "I mean, that -- that's what you're suggesting, isn't it?",
  "The reason one does not use legislative history, if one does not use it, as I don't -- as I don't, is not because Congress doesn't expect it to be used, but because Congress does not have the power to delegate to one of its committees the content of -- of its statutes. The Constitution provides that legislation will be passed by two houses and signed by the President, and the problem with legislative history, for those of us who have a problem with it, is this amounts to a delegation by Congress. It's not a matter of what Congress expected. I don't care what Congress expected. It can't do it. It can't leave it to a -- to a committee to -- to fill in the blanks in a statute. That's the problem, and that has nothing to do with expectations.",
  "But it doesn't go to premeditation. I think that's Justice Ginsburg's point. And I don't see why that isn't correct. It doesn't got to premeditation.",
  "No, but you're saying -- you're saying he could have been charged with second- degree murder --",
  "-- because -- what?",
  "Does not require premeditation. And I --",
  "-- don't see how this goes to premeditation, anyway.",
  "Have we ever held that an insanity defense is required, that a State cannot simply abolish insanity defenses?",
  "I didn't we had.",
  "Under your approach, Mr. Frederick, the Federal court would decide the principal substantive issue in the case, the principal legal issue, nonfactual perhaps, and then decide that is has no jurisdiction if it finds that it doesn't come within -- within (c), sends it back to the State court. Is -- is the State court bound by -- by that finding by the Federal court?",
  "Why not?",
  "Do we have any cases that -- that are like this one which are like this one which involve not just res judicata of -- of the -- of the finding by the Federal court, but the law of the case? I mean this is the same case when it's remanded. You've already had a court that has found a particular element with respect to this case. It seems to me highly unusual to have the same issue in the same case then decided by a second court. Do you have any -- any parallel?",
  "You don't have any case of ours, though.",
  "Whether preemption applies or whether there's a colorable basis for saying? I thought you were saying that the district court decides whether preemption applies.",
  "So you don't -- you don't agree with what Justice Souter was saying, that all it's -- all it's making is a colorable basis.",
  "So he's right that it's ultimately not decided by the Federal court.",
  "You're saying the Federal court makes a decision which is not binding in the case. That decision can be undone by the State court.",
  "Yes, I understand that. Can you answer my question? You -- you were saying that the -- that the decision by the Federal court on this issue is not final.",
  "Okay, but it is not final --",
  "-- for purposes of the lawsuit.",
  "I understand that, but as long as you say that, the point that -- that Justice Alito makes is -- is well taken, that we -- we thought that this was a -- a statute designed to have the Federal courts determine this issue, and it turns out that the Federal court just takes the first swing at it, and if a State court disagrees, it's -- it's free to do so.",
  "What were they doing in the yard anyway? This sort of occurred to me. They couldn't have seen that until they went into the fenced backyard violating the curtilage of the property. How -- was that justified?",
  "Is any less required to -- to go into the curtilage than is required to go into the house?",
  "No. It's the same test?",
  "So you say that even if he didn't see him throw the punch and -- and draw blood, they could have gone in just because they heard somebody say, stop, stop, get off me?",
  "Well, you don't -- you don't really mean that if they saw somebody inside with a gun and they heard him saying, I'm going to shoot you in 2 minutes, since they could have gotten a telephone warrant, they would have to had to get a telephone warrant?",
  "I mean, you -- you don't want the -- the telephone warrant requirement to -- to up the ante on -- on what it takes to -- for the police to go in without a warrant, do you?",
  "But it wouldn't be of the essence if you know you have 2 minutes. You know I'm going to kill you in 2 minutes.",
  "Do you really want the policeman to say I got 2 minutes, you know, dial in and get a warrant? That's ridiculous.",
  "Except that there was a front door, which they approached first. As I recall, they left one of the officers in the front.",
  "So they could have banged on the front door.",
  "Is there, in addition to the safety rationale which you're -- justification, which you're arguing here -- is there a justification to go in to stop an ongoing felony whether safety is involved or not?",
  "Is -- is that a separate --",
  "I mean, you see a guy turning out counterfeit dollar bills, $100 bills, and can you go in right away if you see him doing that?",
  "Well, I mean, but if that's the case, you have a much easier argument. Wasn't there an assault here? There was clearly an assault.",
  "One thing leads to another. Right?",
  "Well, no. You -- you don't want to say that. The noise alone wouldn't justify going in without knocking as would the -- a scene of a violent event occurring. Certainly you'd have to knock on the door. Now, if they didn't hear you and the only way to get their attention to stop the noise is to go in, fine, but wouldn't you have to knock on the door real hard before you went in to stop the noise?",
  "Not appropriate. Necessary.",
  "I hope so. I mean -- people --",
  "A good way to put it.",
  "Except I -- I don't think we look to whether he knew that this was a family reenactment. I think we look to the facts that he had -- that had come to his attention which caused him to believe that this was a family reenactment. I mean, you know, if he had read it in a newspaper or something else. The facts are -- are what matter and not --",
  "Mr. Studebaker, I'm not sure that even the noise wasn't enough to justify what the police did here. As -- as I recall, they -- before they went in, they -- they heard all this noise and they saw the punch. They pushed open the screen door and announced that they were the police. Okay?",
  "And then only went in when nobody heard them. Then they shouted even louder, police. I'm not sure that -- that just the noise wouldn't be enough to allow that. If you can't hear the policeman from the door, who's coming to check about a 3:00 a.m. noisy party, you don't hear his knock on the door, can the policeman not open the door and shout, police? Is that an unreasonable search and seizure. And then if you don't hear that, can he take two steps into the house? He's -- he's not looking under the carpets. He's not looking in the desk drawers. He's just shouting police so that he can bring to the attention of the people there the fact that there's been a complaint from the neighbors and you have to knock off the noise. I -- I would think that's perfectly reasonable. Never mind the punch in the nose.",
  "They didn't hear him when he -- when he just opened the screen door. He had to step in a few more -- a few more steps. Then they finally heard him. That's his -- the way I understand these facts.",
  "Of course, he had to raise his voice. I mean, there was a lot of noise going. It just seems to me so unreasonable, when a policeman comes to tell people they're making too much noise and the neighbors have complained, that he can't do the minimum that's necessary to get their attention so he can tell them that. He has to go get a warrant to tell them that the neighbors are complaining about too much noise? That just seems absurd.",
  "Why isn't screaming, police, enough? I mean, as I understand the facts, he first opened the screen door. Now, is -- is that an entry? He didn't go in. I assume the screen door opens out. Most screen doors open out. He opened the screen door and shouted, police. Now, that -- that doesn't count? he has to knock on the screen door instead, even though they're more likely to hear him if he opens the screen door and yells, police? Why doesn't that meet the requirement? I -- this -- why is the trial court obsessed with knocking?",
  "I don't understand that.",
  "Where is it? Where is it?",
  "You know, maybe -- maybe you're taking our announce and a knock -- knock and announce requirement too -- too seriously or too literally. I mean, if a police officer comes up and the door is open, what does he have to do? Lean over and knock on the side of the door? Can't he shout, hello, police? Don't you think that satisfies a knock and announce requirement?",
  "You really think you got to knock even when the door is open.",
  "Okay. And he did that here.",
  "He stood at the door. He opened the screen door and said, police --",
  "-- which he thought would be more effective than knocking on -- on the -- you know, the -- the edge of a screen door, which doesn't make a very good knock.",
  "I -- I'm sorry, what instruction is that?",
  "I got --",
  "-- that one. It's the other one. It was instruction number --",
  "I gotcha.",
  "All the way at the end of 4, okay.",
  "It seems to me it sounds different if you put it differently. Surely, it's a reasoned moral response to say, \"We have found these horrible aggravating factors in this murder. It's not even your usual murder. There are these terrible aggravating factors. Three of them, we found. And we further find that there is no mitigating evidence to outweigh those aggravating factors.\" That seems to me a perfectly valid moral response.",
  "No.",
  "But it seems to me that to be equal in weight is not to predominate. And that's all the jury is saying --",
  "-- if there's nothing to outweigh the aggravating factors.",
  "Well, and of course --",
  "-- the jury doesn't have a free-falling moral judgment to make. It accepts the judgment of the majority of the people in Kansas that certain aggravators, and only those aggravators, shall be counted against the defendant --",
  "-- and that all of them shall be -- even if the juror himself does not believe, morally, that this particular aggravator ought to be there. So, it's not as though our law says that somehow the jury has to -- each juror has to be able to make, like Solomon, his own moral judgment on this fellow. And one of the things that the -- that the Kansas law prescribes is that when they're in equipoise, the people of Kansas think that the aggravators that they have specified are serious enough that unless there is something to overcome them, the death penalty is appropriate. That seems to me a moral judgment within the limited range of moral judgment that the jury is accorded.",
  "It depends on what you mean by a \"presumption.\" It certainly -- it certainly says that unless you find something that outweighs this, the death penalty is the proper penalty.",
  "The burden is on the jury to find something to outweigh it. And, in the absence of a finding of something that outweighs it, when these aggravators are found, the death penalty is the proper penalty.",
  "Can --",
  "Can I ask you a question that goes to your response to Justice Souter's last question? As I understand the scheme, maybe my understanding is wrong, once they have found the existence of those aggravating factors that justify the death penalty, and then you move into the penalty phase for them to decide whether, in fact, the death penalty would be imposed, it's not up to them to -- they can't eliminate one of those aggravating factors that has been found. They have to take into account all of the aggravating factors that have been found. Isn't that right?",
  "You disagree from your -- with your friend on the other side on that point.",
  "How can we check on that? No, he said that a number of other State statutes would be affected by our coming out the way you would like us, on this.",
  "Because he said --",
  "-- he said it would change Walton, and that would impair those other State statutes.",
  "Yes.",
  "I didn't mean to interrupt your argument, but presumably the attorney general will tell us, in his rebuttal.",
  "Is that an aggravating circumstance?",
  "No, but --",
  "Yes, but I think -- I think the Chief Justice's point is that you're -- you're really not being accurate when you say, \"The jurors can thereby avoid the difficult choice.\" They don't avoid the difficult choice. They're fully aware, under this statutory scheme, that if they don't find that the mitigators outweigh, they are condemning this person to death. That's the moral choice they're faced with. And when they come in with that verdict, they know what they're doing. And I consider that a moral -- a moral judgment on their part.",
  "And you think that a juror who believes that this person shouldn't be -- shouldn't be sent to death -- that is to say, who believes that the mitigators outweigh the aggravators -- would join a jury verdict which produces the result that he's sentenced to death, right? I think that is so unlikely --",
  "-- that he's going to say, \"Well, I -- you know, I think he shouldn't go to death, but the aggravators and mitigators are absolutely evenly balanced, so I guess I've got to send him to death,\" I don't think any juror's going to do that.",
  "It takes only one --",
  "It takes only one to disagree.",
  "What if they still conclude, as they did before, that when these aggravating factors are found, unless there is mitigation to overcome them, it is the judgment of the people of Kansas that this person is deserving of death? What if they come to that conclusion again? You want us to tell them, \"No, the people of Kansas cannot come to that, what seems to me, quite rational decision\"?",
  "It's so silly to say that Kansas can circumscribe the moral judgment of the -- of the jury by saying, \"You can take into account 18 aggravators, or else only two aggravators.\" That is a -- you know, a significant control on their moral judgment. But then to say that Kansas cannot circumscribe their moral judgment to the very limited degree of saying, \"Unless you find that the mitigators outweigh the aggravators, the proper response is the death penalty.\"",
  "But that's different from putting it in. I mean, you want to change what you -- what you allege, that -- that it's mandated by the Government to simply the Government, although it had authority to eliminate it, did not do so? If -- you know, that's a different -- different assertion.",
  "I'll assume it's the latter then.",
  "Those cases came from the days when we were also quite willing to imply Federal causes of action in statutes that had nothing to do with the Government, you know, 10b-5 and things of that sort. I thought we had put all of that behind us. You want us to go back to that bygone age.",
  "That's sort of queer terminology anyway. When Congress has already decided that there should be Federal jurisdiction. It would seem very strange for Congress to say this strengthens the case for Federal -- what do you mean the case for Federal jurisdiction?",
  "We prescribe Federal jurisdiction. I -- you know, I'm not a fan of legislative history, but I -- I don't find that particular piece very much against you. In fact, it may be just -- just the opposite. It may be -- it's lawyers' language, you know. We don't know whether there's Federal jurisdiction or not, but this will make a better case for -- you know, for the other side.",
  "Yes, but -- but -- I'm sorry.",
  "It's a sloppy way to put it, don't you think? Maybe what Congress should have said, although Congress doesn't always speak precisely, is that any -- any State law which contradicts a provision of the contract on these particular subjects is preempted.",
  "Okay, I'll put it differently. All State laws relating to subjects that are covered in the contract are preempted.",
  "Suppose there's a dispute in the -- in the lawsuit about whether a particular benefit to which one - the party was entitled under the contract has been waived. Okay? That's the issue. Is that issue to be decided by Federal law or by State law?",
  "Yes.",
  "No, I'm not talking about the -- I'm talking about the claim, the claim made by an individual against the carrier. And -- and it is asserted that this claim should have been made sooner. It has been waived by not having been brought forward sooner. Okay? That's -- that's the hypothetical. Do -- do you think that that -- that is governed by Federal law?",
  "Whether waiver occurred or not.",
  "Why?",
  "I mean, the text -- the text only -- only says, shall -- which relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits. Extent of coverage or benefits. I don't know that that relates to any of them. It relates to whether the benefit that was covered has been waived.",
  "Yes.",
  "It doesn't speak to it.",
  "Okay. So you're not saying that -- that Federal law is -- is pervasive here, that it covers the -- the entire -- the entire suit between the claimant and the insurer.",
  "Okay. In that respect, doesn't it differ from ERISA?",
  "Well, you're gong to make a lot of trouble for us. We're going to have to sort out which of these things are covered by State law and which aren't.",
  "I -- I wrote Boyle and what I thought I was saying was that the common --",
  "-- was that the common law, Federal common law precluded, preempted any State law which contradicted this contract. Now, you can -- you can put that in a sloppy fashion by saying that the contract preempted State law, but it wasn't --",
  "-- that we thought it was the contract that preempted State law. It was Federal common law which said that the contract -- that any provision in State law which contradicts the contract is preempted by Federal common law. And you can read this statute the same way. It's a sloppy way of putting it, but what it means is Federal law preempts any State provision that is contrary to a provision of the contract --",
  "-- which -- which is certainly constitutional.",
  "Congress isn't always precise, is it?",
  "That's uniform in both Alaska and New York, they are subject to the -- to the Blue Cross waiver of attorney's fees or not. They're being treated uniformly. I don't see that that's disuniform. What is disuniform, it seems to me, is that you have an employee who wins a judgment in Alaska and he gets to keep all his money because Alaska law says the reimbursement provision is -- is invalid, and then you have a Federal employee in Texas who -- who gets a -- wins the same tort lawsuit, and he has to turn over to Blue Cross all the -- the portion of his recovery that would cover the outlay that Blue Cross has made. That's disuniformity.",
  "The Government -- the Government as amicus? The Government as amicus.",
  "Of course, you could say the same about -- about any recovery, that a certain percentage in taxes will go to the Federal Treasury I",
  "Well, I guess you can be -- depending upon how detailed the OPM contract is, you can be consistent with that contract and still have an enormous amount of variation from one to another. It depends entirely upon whether the OPM contract is entirely comprehensive. If it covers every jot and tittle, then I guess you can't be consistent with it and different. But if it's -- if it's sort of bare bones, you -- you could be consistent with that and have a lot of variation, couldn't you?",
  "I would think that it's easier in -- you know, we had -- we had a -- this term another case in which the argument is that you cannot have a separate insanity defense essentially and -- and exclude from the mens rea element of a crime the -- the lack of -- of mental capacity to -- to have that mens rea. This is the same thing you're arguing before us. And -- and it seems to me that if it applies to duress, it applies even -- even more strongly to -- to insanity. How can an insane person form the intent to commit a crime that -- that requires mens rea?",
  "It was her will to yield to the will of someone else. I mean, you can't blame somebody else for her making the choice.",
  "That may be a very intelligent choice on your part to do what the person with the gun at the head of your children tells you to do. But to say that it's not your choice, which is what you're arguing here, the only question is whether that has to be brought forward by reason of -- of a defense of -- of coercion or rather, whether it goes to whether you had the intent. That's all we're talking about here. And it seems to me you have the intent to yield to -- to the demand of whoever has the gun at the head of your children. It's a separate question whether the law should punish your yielding like that.",
  "But -- but you're telling us that you don't have the intent to -- to yield and -- and to do whatever criminal act that person tells you. Right? That just doesn't -- I just don't think it's true.",
  "And you have 21 States and how many circuits --",
  "No. I'm saying how many are on the other side?",
  "Well, that's -- that's sort of a horse race. I'm -- I'm not sure, even if I agreed with your theory, that -- that what the Constitution requires changes on the basis of an evolving common law. Of course, it can only change in one direction. Right? It can only change favorably to -- to your client, favorably to the defendant. It can't change to be more harsh to the defendant because the Constitution prohibits that.",
  "Right? So -- so we have a one-way -- a one-way altering Constitution.",
  "But even -- even if I agreed with that, I'm not sure that, you know, 21 versus 14 is -- is an overwhelming demonstration of -- of the new common law.",
  "29 versus 14.",
  "Mr. Jett, a thought occurred to me, by reason of your agreement, that -- that it's a one-way ratchet, that when the common law changes in the -- in the direction of favoring the defendant, it becomes the duty of the courts to allow that. But, of course, it can't change in the other direction because the Constitution would prevent it. You sort of agreed with that. But -- but if -- if you agree with that, how can you explain our -- our 1895 decision in Davis which held that the insanity defense had to be proved by the Government which was then overridden by a Federal statute. How could -- how could -- if -- if Davis was right about what the -- what the common law required, how could Congress possibly have changed that by a statute? I would assume that all of the basic elements of the common law are picked up in the Due Process Clause. Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't the necessity of -- of proving the mental element of a -- of a crime, even when that mental element is overcome by insanity, why wouldn't that have been embodied in the Due Process Clause so that the congressional statute would have been ineffective?",
  "No. I'm not questioning whether we could do it. I'm questioning whether Congress could do it, whether Congress could overrule what we did in Davis. If Davis said that common law was that the Government has to prove -- disprove insanity, wouldn't that have been part -- become part of the Due Process Clause if it was the common law?",
  "Right.",
  "Well, it makes me suspect that Davis was wrong.",
  "Good catch.",
  "The Government wouldn't -- wouldn't have to disprove duress in the hate case. It would just have to prove hate.",
  "And to the extent that duress undermines that, it would be a defense considered by the jury on the hate question.",
  "What -- what if you're a judge like me who -- who thinks that any significant element of -- of the criminal law, when the Due Process Clause was -- was adopted, remains in effect and it doesn't change with the times as you seem -- as your last comment seems to have said? What do I do with a case like Davis? Not a case like. What do I do with Davis? Davis tells me that this was the common law when the Due Process Clause was adopted.",
  "No?",
  "Oh, I know it was not a constitutional holding, but --",
  "I'll have to go back and look at it.",
  "Okay.",
  "Of course, in the vast majority of criminal cases, there's no doubt that the person did the crime. And so the -- the benefit to the Government is just carrying coals to Newcastle. The -- the defendant would plead guilty but for the fact that he has a plausible coercion defense, and so he puts that coercion defense before the jury, and oh, sure, he does let the -- the Government cross-examine him. But the Government really doesn't need his cross- examination in the ordinary case. Isn't that right?",
  "And I -- I guess the only way we could really tell what the consequences are, as Justice Breyer would -- would like us to be able to tell, is to know how many people who have gotten off on the basis of this defense have gone on to continue a life of crime. And -- and we don't have any stats on that --",
  "We never know the consequences of our decisions, by and large, do we?",
  "Who -- who develops the Model Penal Code? Is that the American Law Institute that does that?",
  "Which once upon a time purported to simply be embodying the -- the general law, the common law. But it doesn't even purport to do that anymore.",
  "There are a lot of law professors involved in it, aren't there?",
  "Mr. Gornstein, just out of curiosity, of the 29 States that have the different rule, in how many of those States was the different rule adopted legislatively and in how many States was it pronounced by the State supreme court?",
  "Maybe your -- your friend on the other side knows.",
  "Clear and convincing.",
  "And three -- three was what? Three States that have adopted it --",
  "By statute.",
  "I'm not sure it's less -- less blameworthy. I mean, if somebody has a gun to the head of my child and I have a choice between doing a criminal act that he wants me to do and shooting him, you think it's -- the less blameworthy is to go do the criminal act?",
  "I wouldn't kill him. I'd just wound him.",
  "Before you get to your second point, why is that first point before us? You -- you didn't raise it in the courts below. You didn't raise it in your petition here. Your question presented it -- I'd like to stretch to reach it, but I don't even find it necessarily included within the question presented. The question presented is whether a defendant corporation and its agents engaged in ordinary, arms-length dealings can constitute an enterprise in light of the settled rule that a RICO defendant must conduct or participate in the affairs of some distinct enterprise and not just its own affairs. It seems to me it's only question two you put before us.",
  "As it is in nine other circuits.",
  "And all circuits against you.",
  "And we would have been unlikely to accept cert on -- on point one alone I think.",
  "In light of the settled rule that a defendant must conduct or participate in the affairs of some distinct enterprise and not just its own affairs.",
  "If you hadn't included that last part, in light of, but it seems to me you're focusing on the -- on the particular claim that you're making.",
  "It is logically prior, and I hate to go through all the trouble of figuring out this case if, indeed, corporations are ineligible anyway. I mean, you know, we're -- we're answering a totally hypothetical, nonexistent question.",
  "If this provision is exclusive, as you claim it is -- it's intended to be an exclusive definition, why -- why would they include union, just union and individuals? What's magic about a union that --",
  "-- that is not equally magic about a partnership or a corporation?",
  "Oh, I see.",
  "This refers to a union that is not -- is not an association.",
  "Or any legal entity.",
  "A union that is not --",
  "-- not a legal entity. I see.",
  "Mr. Phillips, I -- I tend to agree with that, but I -- I just hate to get the lower courts into this business of determining when a corporation is going beyond its business. Your -- your discussion with Justice Souter I think indicates how -- how hard that is, or some of the examples that the Government brings up, such as a drug company that -- that sells drugs illegally, violating the drug laws. Is that part of its business or not part of its business? I -- I really don't -- don't want to buy into that.",
  "I don't see how your point regarding union helps you any because if -- if you -- if you win the point that union doesn't mean a labor union, you still have, as -- as the end of this definition, any union or group of individuals.",
  "A union of individuals or a group of individuals. You're still stuck with individuals.",
  "Either union means labor union or it means a union or group of individuals.",
  "Okay.",
  "I'll give you that. Then -- then it means a union or group of individuals.",
  "Right. So, you know, you're just as bad off.",
  "Yes, but Reves demonstrates that -- that your statement earlier that since it was fraudulent action, it couldn't have been the business of the corporation is simply false. We -- we haven't held that whenever a corporation violates the law, it goes beyond its business, although in a sense it does. In Reves, we -- we said it didn't.",
  "I understand that, but that's -- we have to get into that is my point. We can't just say since providing them with -- with phony ID's is unlawful, it can't be the business of the corporation.",
  "Do -- do any of those cases that you allude to that have means in some sections, includes in others -- do any of them have in third sections, includes, comma, without limitation, comma?",
  "Well, I think that's a big difference.",
  "Close enough.",
  "Mr. Stewart, this -- this thing is at least -- at least -- ambiguous. Why shouldn't we apply the rule that we normally apply with regard to criminal statutes that where there is an ambiguity, the rule of lenity applies and we shouldn't give the -- the Government license to -- to ride closer herd than -- than is clear in the statute? Why isn't -- why isn't that an easy way to --",
  "-- resolve this question?",
  "That's irrelevant because it's not taken alone. It is defined. So the only -- the only question is what this -- what this definition means. Is it exclusive or not exclusive? That's really the only issue.",
  "Even -- even when it's absolutely clear and -- and as pointed out by -- by your friend, you -- you did not refute the point that in other sections where it says includes, it is unquestionable that it is exclusive.",
  "What's the best court of appeals opinion, the most thoroughly considered? I haven't read any of them. Tell me -- tell me the best one. I'd like to read it.",
  "Which you decline to specify. Right?",
  "By a means which you decline to specify, so that if they come up with some other means, you could -- you could object to that as well I assume.",
  "No, I understand that. But I'm just -- I'm just pointing out what -- what becomes available to you if we -- if we give you the relief you request.",
  "You -- we -- we say this -- this procedure is no good. The State comes up with another procedure, and you challenge that one. Right? And -- and another few years go by.",
  "Why?",
  "You -- you think that the -- the way you would proceed in trial court is the trial court finds that this is no good, and -- and then the trial court proposes an alternative, or -- or invites the State to propose to the trial court an alternative, and then asks whether you agree to that alternative. And if you don't, the trial court makes the decision whether the alternative is -- is constitutional or not.",
  "That's not bad.",
  "In this very case, you're saying the court would -- would rule on the State's proposed alternative. Right?",
  "But if you disagreed with that, you could appeal it up again. Right? You can go to the court of appeals --",
  "-- and then seek cert up here. Right?",
  "Is it only excruciating pain that the Eighth Amendment prohibits or is it any pain? Does the Eighth Amendment require painless execution?",
  "Well, when you say wanton and gratuitous, you're -- you're saying any pain that can be eliminated must be eliminated. Otherwise, it's gratuitous I assume.",
  "Yes. So if there's any way of -- of execution that is totally painless, that -- that must be pursued.",
  "Where -- where do you derive that from? I mean, gee, you know, that -- that was certainly never the principle evident in -- in executions in the past. Hanging was -- was not a -- you know, a quick and easy way to go. You would have thought they would have required a firing squad instead or something like that. I -- I just don't know where you're deriving this principle that there cannot be any pain associated with the execution.",
  "I can understand excruciating pain, but -- but you -- you want to press it to the point where there can't be any pain associated. Any pain that can be eliminated must be eliminated. That seems to me a very extreme proposition.",
  "No. I understand what you're challenging here. But what -- what alternative would be acceptable to you? Only one -- only one that -- that, to the maximum extent possible, eliminates all pain. Isn't that right?",
  "Well, but -- but you -- you -- their procedure was set forth in a -- in a notice, a regulation or something. You -- you had notice of what procedure they intended to use several years ago, didn't you?",
  "Now, you're saying they could change it in the future, but sure, of course. Any -- any agency can change its -- its regulations. But didn't you know that this is the procedure they intended to use several years ago?",
  "So you have to wait to -- you have to wait to the eve of execution before -- before you think you have a -- a ripe claim under -- under habeas.",
  "Congress has the complete discretion to change the statutes it's enacted, but that doesn't mean that you can't change -- you can't challenge a statute now because it might be changed before -- before the action you want to take occurs. You can challenge it now. And it seems to me it's the same thing with the method of execution prescribed by -- by an administrative agency in -- in a State.",
  "I don't understand. How did you get into the court if you didn't know what protocol they were going to use?",
  "You say you didn't know it until the 19th when your case was already in the court. What -- what were you challenging?",
  "Excuse me. How did the trial court get into it? Does the records request go through -- through a trial court?",
  "What -- what is the -- the action that you're bringing? An action for records request?",
  "Well, they still do, but you're here. I mean, they -- they still have the opportunity to change it, but you're here challenging it even though it is still changeable. Right?",
  "Why is that? Why is that? That -- that -- in which case it would be like -- like Heck. Right? It would come within the Heck principles.",
  "I didn't -- I didn't get your explanation. Had you finished it?",
  "I don't think -- I don't think that's the research they would do. I think the research they would do would be to come up with another method that the State certainly would not find acceptable, thereupon, rendering it a 1983 action and -- and leaving everything in the same status that it's -- that it is here. I mean, I don't see that you've accomplished anything by simply demanding that they -- that they come up with an alternative. They're going to come up with a -- with an unacceptable alternative.",
  "It -- it might be malpractice not to come up with -- with an unacceptable alternative.",
  "We've -- we've never held that anyway, have we?",
  "That the State must, in -- in imposing the death penalty, use a method that inflicts the least amount of pain.",
  "Suppose -- suppose they did set it forth but reserved the right to change it. They promulgated a regulation without public notice, without hearings or anything. This is our regulation. This is how we intend to conduct executions in the future. Period. We reserve the right to change this. Would you claim that -- that this was not ripe? You couldn't challenge it at that point --",
  "-- because they could change it?",
  "No. This is the current method that we intend to use in all future executions. Period. We may change our mind.",
  "Don't -- don't you think you -- you --",
  "-- don't you think effectively had that knowledge when you knew -- knew about Sims and you knew about all of the cases after Sims? Is that very much short of -- of their saying this is the -- the procedure we intend to use?",
  "Counsel, what -- what do you do with our opinion in -- in 1986 in Segura v. United States, which seems to me to contradict your assertion that you cannot separate, for purposes of the exclusionary rule, the manner of entry from the search? In that case, the -- the policemen entered without a search warrant. So the entry was clearly a violation. They left two officers in the room and other officers went back and got a search warrant. When they returned with the search warrant, the two officers who were in the room proceeded to do a search, and we admitted the evidence. It seems to me that in that case, we -- we did succeed in -- in separating the -- the entry from the subsequent search, and I don't know why -- why we can't do the same thing here.",
  "What -- what were the exceptional circumstances?",
  "We're still, it would seem to me -- I don't know -- the warrant wasn't dependent on the initial entry? You could also say the initial entry wasn't the product of the -- of the later warrant.",
  "And therefore was unlawful.",
  "But we didn't hold -- but we didn't hold that.",
  "Excuse me? No, I don't understand that.",
  "No. I'm talking about only the evidence that -- that was the product of the search conducted after the warrant was delivered.",
  "And that evidence was admitted in.",
  "Even though the entry of those officers was an unlawful entry.",
  "Well, no, no. The -- there was no subsequent entry. You said the initial entry was unlawful. Those officers stayed there. Their presence there was the product of an unlawful entry.",
  "Their presence was the product of an unlawful entry, and nonetheless, we admitted in the -- the material that they obtained in the search after a warrant had been obtained.",
  "Is --",
  "Is in the chair the same thing as on the chair?",
  "You tell me something is in the chair. Did they stuff it -- stuff it in the cushion or what?",
  "Yes, inside it - -",
  "I think it's pretty clear you don't talk of something as being in the chair. It's on the chair unless you stuff it in the chair. I assume he stuffed it behind a pillow or something.",
  "English is English. You said it was in the chair.",
  "Okay.",
  "Sure you would. Sure you would.",
  "I mean, you'd deterred him more if you threw the whole case out, but we don't do that.",
  "Yes.",
  "I mean, we -- we insist that the deterrence somehow be related --",
  "-- to the -- and -- and the related usually means that the acquisition of the evidence was the product of the violation. It was caused by the violation. And -- and for that reason, we keep it out. And here, it's -- it's hard to say that this was caused by the fact that they -- that they entered in a few seconds too soon. So he would have answered the door and they would have seen the stuff.",
  "Although you say it can be retroactively validated.",
  "Yes, in Segura, you can retroactively validate it by -- by getting a warrant afterwards. Could it be -- have been retroactively validated by knocking and announcing afterwards? I'm -- I'm sorry we came in too soon, and they run back to the door and they knock and announce and wait -- wait 10 seconds.",
  "Would that do the job?",
  "The hypothetical sounds ridiculous only if one accepts your explanation of Segura, that -- that it was somehow a retroactive validation.",
  "What about just the former without the latter? I thought the former alone would be enough.",
  "But I assume that lawsuits are allowable if -- if knock and announce is -- is not observed, and if you intrude upon someone in a state of undress.",
  "Isn't a civil lawsuit bringable?",
  "Wait a minute. The government is not arguing here that -- that it's valid. It's just arguing that though it is invalid, the punishment for it should not be to let the criminal go. That's -- that's all they're saying.",
  "The punishment for the invalidity should not be the -- the inadmissibility of all of the evidence of the crime that was found.",
  "Well, that's quite different from saying that it's -- that it's valid. So I think they acknowledge that -- that a lawsuit against an officer who knowingly dispenses with -- with knock and announce because, as you say, he says there's -- there's no consequence, but there is a consequence. He can be sued.",
  "And sometimes he may be going into the wrong house and the person suing him may not be a criminal, but may be some -- some innocent -- innocent bystander. And -- and what about -- you know, you say there's no incentive to knock and announce. There -- there may -- you don't know any Michigan cases in which a -- a civil suit has succeeded, but I know numerous cases in which police who -- who burst in without knocking and announcing expose themselves to danger, that is, to being shot at by a -- by a householder who doesn't know that they are the police. Isn't that enough of -- of an incentive, the fact that you may lose your life?",
  "What about -- you talk about deterrence. What about their not getting promoted? I assume that -- that police departments, even if you have some maverick officers, that the administration of the police department teaches them that they have to knock and announce. Or if it doesn't teach them that, then you do have a 1983 cause of action against the city, not just the officers. And that -- you know, that's a deep pocket.",
  "Why? Really?",
  "You -- you know, I'm the police commissioner and I have a policy that you -- you obey the law, you knock and announce, and -- and I know that this particular officer disregards it all the time. You really think that's not going to go in his record?",
  "Mapp was a long time ago. It was before 1983 was being used, wasn't it?",
  "You bet you.",
  "Don't argue it to me. It doesn't make much sense.",
  "Is there any evidence that the citizens -- that Michiganders are less litigious than people in other States?",
  "So -- so the mere existence of suits in other States ought to suffice as something --",
  "-- that's -- that's a deterrent. Shouldn't it?",
  "Well, give some cases first. He's talking about actual cases.",
  "I mean, isn't it possible that if his law clerk overlooked Segura, he overlooked other cases as well.",
  "There was unquestionably, was there not, a violation of the Fourth Amendment in Segura?",
  "It doesn't have to be forward- looking, does it? I mean, I thought we've said \"so long as it can be taken into account in any manner,\" whether backward-looking or forward-looking. Haven't we said that, explicitly?",
  "Well, that's what I thought your position was. And - -",
  "-- then you back off of it, and you say, \"extenuate the gravity\" of the crime doesn't relate to anything that's after the crime. I would have -- I would have interpreted the phrase to mean \"anything that justifies you in giving a lesser punishment for the crime.\"",
  "Well, then your answer to Justice Stevens should have been different.",
  "Be respectful anyway.",
  "Or maybe they thought that was a problem of Ninth Circuit confusion rather than jury confusion.",
  "I mean, having that opinion in front of them, you would think they would amend it, of course, to prevent that kind of decision again.",
  "But you're saying those convictions are more than -- more than 23 years old?",
  "It's on page 9 of your -- of your brief. The --",
  "-- italicized portion.",
  "Only if you think that excusing the crime and extenuating its gravity are one and the same thing, which I don't really think.",
  "Yes, but what has to be clear under Teague is not just the rule, but the rule's application in circumstances like this. There are a lot of rules that are clear, but if Teague means anything at all it has to mean that you should have known that, in this case, the rule would produce this result. So it's not enough to say that there was a rule. There are a lot of rules out there, but the question is whether the outcome should have been clear at the time. Isn't that what Teague means?",
  "If the judge's response to Juror Hern was so misleading, why didn't counsel object to it, if it was as obviously misleading as you say?",
  "That's why you have counsel there, to help the court when the court makes a real boo-boo, and if this was as obviously error as you say, one would have expected some objection from defense counsel.",
  "Where - -",
  "Where are those sections?",
  "Okay.",
  "What are the sections -- (b)?",
  "All right.",
  "We have a case involving standing which says that -- you know, the doctrine of standing is more than a -- an exercise in the -- in the conceivable. And this seems to me an exercise in the conceivable. Nobody thinks your client is really, you know, abstaining from tequila down in Mexico because he's on supervised release in the United States, or is going - - is going to apply -- having been deported from the country for criminal offenses, is going to apply to come back in the -- these are ingenious exercises in the conceivable. This is just not the real world.",
  "That depends on whether you consider the sentence to be effectively expired once he leaves the country, if the sentence is one of supervised release, which is impossible once he leaves the country. Supervision being impossible, supervised release is not a realistic consequence of the prior conviction.",
  "Do you think there's a realistic possibility that this person is going to be readmitted? A realistic possibility?",
  "Oh.",
  "Do you think there's a realistic possibility he's going to try to get readmitted, so that he can be subjected to really enforced supervised release?",
  "Has he applied for such a visa? Has he expressed any intention to apply?",
  "Well - -",
  "-- then it's an exercise in the conceivable, it seems to me.",
  "Is there any indication that that's in the works, or is this just another conceivable thing?",
  "Yes.",
  "I thought the Government has taken the position -- and as far as I know, all the Courts of Appeals have bought the Government's argument -- that there -- you do not need a conviction --",
  "-- that so - -",
  "Yes. You don't - -",
  "Yes, but - -",
  "-- but 924(c) is incorporated in 1101(a)(43). It's - -",
  "-- incorporated. So, you want us to interpret 924(c) one way for criminal convictions - - a criminal sentence -- that is, you don't need a conviction in order to get the enhancement -- but another way for --",
  "-- for the INA?",
  "Why is --",
  "-- that?",
  "Well, but you don't -- you don't look to the jurisdiction of conviction. Are you telling me you require a conviction? You -- I thought you told me you don't require a conviction.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, could - -",
  "Sure.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, could I ask you about your assertion that you \"look to the State of conviction\"? What do you mean by that? For purposes of 1101. Does that mean, if you're convicted, in State court, of a misdemeanor -- and even though that action would be a Federal felony, it's not an aggravated felony?",
  "So, it's sort of a double inconsistency. Not only do you treat State -- State actions that are -- that are minimal -- I'm sorry, where the State treats it more seriously than the Federal Government, not only do you follow the State, but, where the State treats it less leniently than the Federal Government, you also follow the State.",
  "Is that right?",
  "So, you look to the State of conviction. What - -",
  "That's for purposes of the immigration law.",
  "Okay. Now, do you do the same for purposes of the felony enhancement provision?",
  "You - -",
  "Well, that seems to me - -",
  "-- very strange. You would look to the -- you would look to the State law for purposes of the immigration section; but, for purposes of 924(c), what would you look to? Either one. Either one. Whichever - -",
  "-- whichever -- for 924 - - whichever one would make it a felony.",
  "You lose.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "All right.",
  "If it's a felony under either one, for purposes of 924(c), you lose, right?",
  "If the act is either a State felony or a Federal felony, you lose. I mean, the defendant gets the enhanced sentence, right, under 924(c)?",
  "No?",
  "Well - -",
  "Listen.",
  "Listen. My question is a simple one. If it's -- it seems to me, if it's -- what you're saying is, if it is either a felony under Federal law or a felony under State law, you get the enhanced sentence under 924(c), isn't that right?",
  "I thought that's - -",
  "-- what the whole argument is about, whether it has to be a felony under Federal law. You're telling me, if it's a misdemeanor under Federal law, that you don't get - -",
  "-- the enhanced sentence?",
  "You've thoroughly confused me now.",
  "Never mind sentencing, let's get back to the immigration. If I understand what you're now saying, if you're convicted in State Court of action that is a Federal felony, but it's just a State misdemeanor -- right? -- you look to the State of conviction, and it would be a misdemeanor, and the immigration provisions would not -- would not take effect. Is - -",
  "-- that right?",
  "That's extraordinary.",
  "Excuse me, I don't -- I don't understand what you just said. You mean, it would be enforceable; that if such a suit were brought, the licensor could raise that contractual provision as a basis for dismissing the suit. Is that - -",
  "Okay.",
  "So, then it is enforceable.",
  "You -- well, you can have such a dispute on a theoretical question between, I don't know, the ACLU and the National Rifle Association, but that doesn't create a case or controversy. What is the injury, the imminent injury to your -- to your client that is the basis for the case or controversy?",
  "Is it anything other than, \"I have to pay the royalties that I agreed to pay.\"?",
  "Is it -- is it unlawful to agree to pay somebody money who does not have a patent?",
  "I mean, you're speaking as though somehow that -- such a contract is contrary to public policy, and void.",
  "Contractually? They say that that's their contractual right?",
  "Where does that appear in the licensing agreement? Or - -",
  "Yes, I took them as just asserting a general proposition of law -- that, where they've agreed to pay royalties because of a patent, if the patent is invalid, they don't have to pay royalties -- not because there's some special provision in this contract.",
  "So, there's really not much at issue in this case. And that's clearly a case of controversy, isn't it? There is a dispute over the meaning of that provision of the agreement.",
  "Gee, there's less here than meets the eye.",
  "And what would their -- what would their concrete injury be? What is the threatened imminent injury that they would assert in that -- in that action?",
  "You have a licensee who's paying the license fees. What is their concrete injury?",
  "But - -",
  "-- so long as they're still paying the royalties, isn't that sort of an abstract disagreement? I mean, it's sort of like the ACLU saying that the patent's invalid. You know, it's a nice theoretical question that we can argue about, but as long as they're paying the royalties, where's the concrete injury?",
  "I find it - -",
  "I find it - -",
  "-- very difficult - -",
  "-- to see how there would be a proper declaratory judgment action brought by the patentee here. It's just not the kind of a situation where you can have a mirror-image suit. I don't see what the - -",
  "-- patentee --",
  "That's fine.",
  "And why - -",
  "-- doesn't that work here?",
  "What is the - -",
  "Could I have a review of the bidding? What - -",
  "Go back -- what is the hypothetical --",
  "Continue on.",
  "Ms. Mahoney, the patent bar is sort of specialized -- more than \"sort of\" -- it's a specialized bar, and I've never -- I've never been a part of it. Do you agree with the statement of the Petitioner's counsel that Gen-Probe came as a -- as a shock to the - -",
  "Wait, wait. Before you leave that, do you agree that it was not raised below?",
  "Where -- can you tell us where it was raised below?",
  "I think your point has to be that there are administrative proceedings that are not actions.",
  "Right.",
  "You contend that what commenced the action here was the order demanding payment.",
  "That's a very weird commencement of an action, where what then follows is what is referred to as an \"appeal,\" within the agency.",
  "Which says that?",
  "What page of your brief?",
  "Of the reply.",
  "I'm not finding it. Where is it, again?",
  "Why is -- why doesn't it make much more sense -- as I understand the proceeding, this order doesn't come out of the blue. As required, there has to be a letter to the -- to the payee saying, \"We think -- we think you owe so much money.\" He is allowed to respond, right?",
  "And then, after considering the response, the order issues. Now, I would consider that a -- you know, an -- that sounds to me like a complaint and an opportunity to respond to it. And then, finally, the first decision of the agency, which is then appealed - - and CFR provides for an -- what he calls an appeal. And it seems to me the final opinion of the agency is the opinion on the appeal.",
  "Well, it doesn't - -",
  "-- waive it, but it can't issue the order without having issued the letter first, giving - -",
  "-- giving the party an opportunity to say why this amount isn't owed.",
  "Is there anything that requires the order?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well - -",
  "So, you could say the same for the other.",
  "You don't -- you don't -- but you don't respond to the order; you take an appeal from the order.",
  "It seems to me crazy to call that order a complaint. I -- even if I grant your other argument, that an administrative proceeding can be commenced by a complaint -- or that the term \"complaint\" can apply to administrative proceedings, I don't think that what you've hung your hat on here -- namely, the order -- seems to me to fit that description.",
  "I doubt whether - -",
  "-- that would - -",
  "I doubt whether that would conform with the Administrative Procedure Act. I mean, either -- even at the first level of agency decision - -",
  "-- it seems to me you have to give the individual an opportunity to reply.",
  "Of course you can ignore it. That doesn't prove anything. You could ignore an agency complaint, too - -",
  "-- I mean, a formal complaint, in which case you'll be found liable. What does - -",
  "-- the fact that you don't have to respond have to do with anything?",
  "Well, you - -",
  "-- you'd win in this case even if it did. I don't think that the difference between the initial letter giving you an opportunity to reply, and the -- what you call the \"complaint,\" the order -- that time period doesn't put you out of -- out of the permissible period.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, 2415(a), (i), we -- you, you cannot possibly say that that only applies to judicial actions, can you?",
  "Yes.",
  "And that's in - -",
  "-- and that's in title 28.",
  "Yes.",
  "What - -",
  "They could have said -- if the other interpretation of 2415(a), as not applying to administrative proceedings, were correct, they could have said the provisions of this section do not apply to administrative proceedings - -",
  "-- which would have -- which would have handled the offset - -",
  "-- but would have been well beyond the offset. And the fact - -",
  "-- that they only focus on the offset certainly suggests that when you're not talking about offset, it does apply to administrative proceedings.",
  "I can believe that they do - -",
  "-- I can -- I can believe that they do that.",
  "But --",
  "By mistake. But I would not assume a mistake unless it's very clear.",
  "It often does. It often does. But it does not, universally. And there are a number of instances cited by the Petitioner that -- where this Court and -- and statutes use the term in context where it clearly applies to administrative proceedings.",
  "So, the question is, How -- you know, how absurd is it not to read it to apply to administrative proceedings in this case? And I find it pretty absurd, because you assume, if you read that it way, that there is effectively no statute of limitations whatever for the Government in these cases.",
  "Wait.",
  "Excuse me. And this was the Congress that enacted what?",
  "Oh.",
  "Which is not what we're talking about here.",
  "As late as 1978, the Justice Department didn't think that way, did it?",
  "The opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel, in '78, was exactly what the Petitioner here would urge.",
  "But -- excuse me -- how could OLC possibly think that it applied to administrative offsets if it didn't apply to administrative proceedings? I mean, it was a contradiction of the proposition, which you're urging here, which is that this statute applies only to judicial proceedings. I mean, that's the point. Whether they spoke just to offsets or not, the position taken by the Justice Department was that this statute relates to administrative proceedings.",
  "Do we have - -",
  "-- that opinion, by the way? Both sides cited it. The -- is it -- it was unpublished.",
  "Does anybody give it to us?",
  "Yes, I know they did offer, but nobody did it.",
  "Good. I would like that.",
  "How about the initial letter that, in the agency practice, precedes the order? I gather there's a letter to the - -",
  "Sounds to me like a complaint, a response - -",
  "-- and an adjudication. I mean, you know - -",
  "-- \"We think you owe this.\"",
  "The response comes back, \"I don't think we owe it, and here's why.\" And then there's a ruling, \"You do owe it.\" And that's the order. And then you can appeal it. And the CFR refers to it as an appeal.",
  "It does not - -",
  "-- assert that there's a discrepancy?",
  "Do we have an example of issue letters anywhere? That's not in the materials either, is it? In the - -",
  "Right.",
  "I don't think so. I tried to figure that out. I think - -",
  "I think - -",
  "Okay.",
  "How do you defend against a claim for, you know, stuff that went on a hundred years ago?",
  "I -- I'm really very reluctant to -- unless there is no possible other reading of the statute, to think that that's -- that that's what the law provides, that the Government can show up a hundred years later, and say, \"Oh, by the way, you owe all this money.\"",
  "The company says \"Gee, I -- you know, I don't have records from a hundred years ago.\"",
  "Say that again. Until 1966, there were no statute of limitations against any Government suits?",
  "He didn't apply against the Government either.",
  "That's another indication. Why would you allow them to destroy those records after 6 years if you -- if you thought -- if you thought that there was no statute of limitations to claims for these things? I mean, that's just another inconsistency that - - in the statutory scheme that's created.",
  "You say, \"You can destroy your records after 6 years.\" Well, why? It doesn't make any sense.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, except when you -- when you say \"this legislation,\" you limit it to the body of 2415(a) and you leave out (i), which -- -- or I guess it's \"one.\" Is it? Little -- or - -",
  "It's (i). I mean, that clearly does apply to administrative proceedings. And I could understand the argument that Congress was just making things doubly clear -- okay? -- that (a) does not apply to administrative proceedings. I could understand that argument if the way (i) was written is, \"The provisions of this section shall not apply to administrative proceedings.\" And then I would say, \"You know, oh, well, that was always the case, and this is just making it clear.\" It doesn't say that. It says that -- the only administrative proceeding that they cut out of it is these offsets.",
  "And, you know, the normal rule is inclusio unius, exclusio alterius. I would -- it means, to me, when I read the statute as a whole -- and that's the way I read statutes, I don't ask whether this section was adopted this year, and the other section was adopted next year -- I don't do it bite by bite; you look at the whole text -- and, when you read all this stuff together, it seems to me that the import of (i) is that administrative proceedings, despite the fact that \"action\" is not a very common word to use for them, are covered.",
  "That's the best thing you have going for you, really, the strict construction canon.",
  "What if I didn't think the order was a complaint, but I thought the initial letter was a complaint? Would the Petitioner lose? Because they never made that argument.",
  "Yes.",
  "Even if you have an administrative proceeding which is called a \"complaint\"? You know, I mean -- and some are, I think.",
  "And that would not be covered by 2415(a).",
  "And let's assume all those terms are used in the agency procedure. They're talking about \"action,\" \"right of action.\" All those terms are used in the agency's procedural rules. Would they then come under this thing?",
  "I think you have to say no - -",
  "-- because, otherwise, it would be up to the agency, just by renaming their things, to come in or out, right?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, that's true. That's true. But the provision you're arguing that you come under does talk about a complaint.",
  "And that's what -- you know, that's what starts the 6 years running. And it's -- seems to me odd to call something a \"complaint\" which is, in fact, an order. They're not complaining about anything; they're saying, \"Pay the money.\"",
  "You know, usually a complaint, you're -- you make your point, and say, \"What do you say? What's your answer?\"",
  "And this is an order. \"You're -- boom, \"Pay.\"",
  "Well, that's only true if you consider an appeal to be the response. And that's rather weird, that - -",
  "-- that the response to a complaint is an appeal.",
  "Could you get us -- we're going to have supplemental material filed, the OLC opinion. Could you -- could you get us a -- you know, a sample of an agency letter? Or, if you can't, maybe the Government can?",
  "What - -",
  "What other areas would we be messing up by finding for you? I mean, here, you know, if we don't find that this administrative action is covered by this statute of limitations, there's no statute of limitations. But there may -- there are other -- may be other areas covered by this text -- namely, a suit by the United States -- founded upon any contract expressly or implied in law or in fact, where there is some kind of a statute of limitations.",
  "And that would prevail over this - -",
  "-- because it's more - -",
  "-- specific.",
  "But they have made it that, haven't they, in a later regulation? Haven't they said just that.",
  "In a later order, yes.",
  "Are rate making regulations issued under 201, do they purport to be the FCC's definition of what is just and reasonable compensation?",
  "They are issued under 201.",
  "So they are an interpretation of the statutory language in 201.",
  "And you say this one is not.",
  "You say it would be a reasonable practice not to pay the money, but for the existence of the regulation.",
  "Before you go back, let's hear about the accounting rules. What would they be issued under? Would they be issued under 201?",
  "It seems to me accounting rules -- in order to decide what is just and reasonable, you have to have accounting rules. So the accounting rules fit very comfortably under 201.",
  "What can't -- what can't be sucked in under section 201? I mean, once the FCC issues a regulation, it's easy to say that any violation of that regulation is unjust. And that's what's happened here. And this just makes a farce of the provision that says the only private causes of action are for violations of the statute and not for violations of the regulation. It seems to me if this thing, 276, can get sucked into 201 simply by reason of the fact that failing to obey an FCC regulation is unjust, that provision is a nullity.",
  "No, I'm saying you'd have to argue that if the theory you're propounding for this case is correct. Violation of an FCC regulation is unjust. Failing to comply with an FCC regulation is unjust.",
  "So can -- every FCC regulation can be enforceable by private action? All the FCC has to say is that violation of this regulation is unjust.",
  "No?",
  "But at least -- at least any FCC regulations relating to charges, practices -- and you want to interpret practices very broadly -- classifications, and regulations for and in connection with communication service, all of those regulations can be sued upon in Federal court with all the diverse and contradictory rulings that that will produce, so long as the FCC says that the failure to obey this regulation is, in our view, unjust.",
  "I don't think he's saying that. I don't think he's saying that if it is covered under regulation, it can't be unjust. Some regulations do relate to justness and reasonableness, but not 276. I think what he's saying is 276 established a scheme. It didn't have to be this scheme. It could have been some other scheme. Nothing in the nature of things says that the long distance carrier has to be the one liable for this. It rather was simply imposed by the FCC. That's fine. But to say that it would be unjust for them not to do that is just unreal, unless you're going to allow any violation of any FCC regulation to be unjust.",
  "But the rate regulation is -- is established in order to determine what reasonableness and justness requires. And 276 is something quite different.",
  "Well, but wait. Wait. Wait. It says to furnish such communications service, is what (a) says. And they don't furnish such communications service to your client.",
  "Such communications service.",
  "And I would think that would mean such communications service that was furnished.",
  "Well, except that it is none of their business.",
  "We - -",
  "Well, you should be arguing, then, that we should give Chevron deference to the Commission's interpretation of Section 208. And once we do that, if 208 governs this thing, then so does 206.",
  "I thought you should be.",
  "Well, but they're certainly entitled to deference as to whether an administrative action can be brought under 208.",
  "Once you say that it can, then a court action can be brought under 206.",
  "So you think we don't owe them deference for 206, but we do for 208. And if you give deference for 208, 206 automatically decides itself.",
  "Yes.",
  "Depending upon how broadly you think Congress intends regulations to be sucked into the terms of this statute. I mean, your interpretation means Sandoval really didn't say a heck of a lot.",
  "Yeah, but you could say any violation of a regulation is unjust.",
  "So Sandoval doesn't mean a heck of a lot. All the FCC has to say is, we think violation of this regulation is unjust.",
  "Except that the -- what was it, the Rogers case, which said that the -- well, you debate whether it said that, but let's assume that it said that the rule of proximate causality doesn't apply to the negligence of the defendant. The basis for that holding was that in whole or in part language which is used for the negligence of the defendant, but not used for the contributory negligence. So if you believe that that case was at least decided for the right reason, it seems to me there's a good argument that it changed it for the one, but not for the other.",
  "But nobody does --",
  "Except we've rejected petitions for certiorari on that issue at least a couple of times. Eleven circuits are in agreement as to what Rogers required. You - -",
  "Do you really expect to get five votes for the railroad on this, what would be a massive change of what is assumed to be the law for, what, 50 years?",
  "But you were wise enough not to ask for that.",
  "Rogers said, in whole or in part. Now, I agree with you, that I don't see how that does it. But Rogers said that it did it.",
  "Yeah, but your example of other instances including having to compare a defendant who did the tort intentionally with negligent -- contributory negligence, that's not what we have here. We have here a difference in the causation. Intentional or non-intentional has nothing to do with causation. But once you say that there's a difference in the causation, it seems to me you cannot compare the two. You cannot compare the two sensibly, unless you are using the same kind of a standard. I mean, let's assume that you find that the railroad did not directly, but nonetheless caused the injury to some extent, but the defendant was directly contributory to it. What do I do? Do I add another 40 percent to his culpability because it was -- his causation was more direct than the plaintiff's causation?",
  "Why not?",
  "No, it doesn't. It certainly bears considerably upon the culpability of the two, it seems to me.",
  "Answer the question, Justice Souter. Yes or no.",
  "Can you have more than one proximate cause?",
  "Of course. So then how can \"in whole or in part\" possibly eliminate the proximate cause requirement, because it could be in part and still be a proximate cause. How can that language possibly be interpreted to eliminate the proximate cause requirement?",
  "How can you say no when you acknowledge that the prior law when there was contributory negligence used to require proximate cause for both the negligence of the defendant and for the contributory negligence of the defendant? Such a situation could not exist unless proximate cause doesn't have to be the sole cause. It can be just the cause in part, right?",
  "So the mere fact that we had contributory negligence statutes that were applying proximate cause requirements demonstrates that a proximate cause can be a cause in part.",
  "It doesn't seem to me that slight is the opposite of proximate. It could be a slight proximate cause.",
  "It is not the kind of change anybody would have relied on, is it? I mean, I find it hard to see reliance interest on this interpretation.",
  "I find it hard to see any reliance interest on this 50 year old interpretation. Is there anybody doing something differently because they believe that the railroad does not have to be accused of proximate causality? Does anybody act differently because of that rule? I don't think so.",
  "Excuse me, you mean you can never decide this question until after the trial is completed and you see whether the jury convicts beyond a reasonable doubt?",
  "Now why would there be any difference then? That's a question I was about to put to you. What if there is no indictment at all? Why couldn't you say the same thing? Well, you know, the only purpose of getting it is to see if there was probable cause and you now have a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.",
  "I don't think it's pushing it, I think it's there.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, if we disagree with you here, could this defendant be retried? Could he be reindicted?",
  "I would like to even sharpen Justice Breyer's hypothetical. Let's assume that the indictment did set forth what the overt act was. It did. But there was no evidence of that overt act introduced before the grand jury. What would the result of that be?",
  "Then the trial occurs - -",
  "He's convicted. And I think you're going -- your position is that conviction would stand.",
  "That doesn't seem to me to make a lot of sense.",
  "Well, I don't understand that. You're saying it's a separate offense, but a lesser included offense is a separate offense. It just happens to be embraced within some other offense.",
  "What does that mean, if you're tried for illegal entry and the Government doesn't prove the illegal entry because you're under supervision when you get in, the jury could not convict of attempt?",
  "And that would be okay, just charge with attempt without setting forth the overt acts for the attempt?",
  "Mr. Baggot, could I come back to your answer to my earlier question. You said you could only be convicted of the lesser included offense if the lesser included offense is set forth explicitly in the indictment. Are you sure of that?",
  "Are you sure that's the law?",
  "As I said in my previous question, every lesser included offense is itself a substantive offense. That doesn't distinguish attempt from anything else. And my understanding is if you're charged with a greater offense, the lesser can be a subject of conviction even though it's not explicitly set forth in the indictment.",
  "And if that is the case here, then it seems to me he could have been convicted of attempt without ever having had set forth in the indictment the overt act that you demand.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, is attempt a lesser included offense of the substantive offense of illegal reentry?",
  "That would be an erroneous instruction, I assume.",
  "You either have to have an erroneous instruction or a special verdict.",
  "Right.",
  "I think your answer would be that how could it possibly be reasonable except for the consideration of some additional fact? What makes it reasonable other than facts? Atmosphere? I mean - -",
  "I didn't understand it. If he does -- tell me again, would you? I thought your response was going to be what Justice -- who suggested it?",
  "Somebody on that side suggested it. That to talk about the fact that there's a lot of crime in the community as an aggravating factor doesn't make any sense. Aggravating factor means something that makes the crime that this person committed worse, not the need for punishment greater, but makes the crime worse. Now, if that is not your answer, what is the answer that you gathered, from the left of me?",
  "To say that a sentence within the guideline range is reasonable is not to say that a sentence outside the guideline range is unreasonable. So under the Federal system, it is perfectly possible -- unless, unless we hold otherwise -- for a judge to give a sentence beyond the guideline range, and nonetheless to be affirmed, because although the guideline range is reasonable, there are other systems that would be reasonable, right?",
  "Or they could say the middle term will always be reasonable. Couldn't they say that?",
  "That's not so at all. California says if you go over the middle range, it is unreasonable, period, unless you prove or you find one of the aggravating factors. That's a constraint. You cannot go above the middle range.",
  "No, that's not what we found in Booker. We found in Booker, or at least the way the lower Federal courts have been interpreting Booker, if you use the guideline range, and you're within the guideline range, that is automatically reasonable, you don't have to worry about it. But we haven't held, and I don't believe most of the Federal courts have held, that if you go beyond the guideline range, it is automatically unreasonable. And that is the case with the California system, if you go beyond the middle range, it is automatically unreasonable unless you -- unless you find one of the aggravating facts.",
  "But the justification under the Federal system could be, you know, this is what the sentencing commission thought was a reasonable sentence for this crime. I disagree with that. Now, there are other authorities who think that that's a little too, you know, below what it ought to be. He can simply disagree with the sentencing guidelines. Or he could point out what Justice Breyer suggests, well, the sentencing guidelines may be okay for some jurisdictions, but in this jurisdiction, we have a special problem with regard to this kind of a crime. He can do that and doesn't have to find any special fact. He cannot do that in California.",
  "It isn't the same in the Federal guidelines. Under the Federal guidelines, the judge could say, you know, I think this offense is more serious than what the sentencing commission thought, and these are my reasons for it. There was a dissent, you know -- the sentencing commission's determinations are reasonable, but they are surely not the only reasonable disposition. And it is open to a Federal district judge to say, well, that's what they thought, and I took it into account, and I seriously considered it, and I think they are wrong on this, I think this is more serious. And that could be a perfectly reasonable determination. That couldn't be done in California.",
  "Well, it's not true. You certainly didn't argue that way in your papers up to now. I thought that there has to be a finding of some aggravating factor, not simply, I think deterrence is more than what the statute says, or deterrence requires more than what the statute says. Is that really your position, that if a judge thinks deterrence requires more than the middle range, for that reason alone, he can say I ignore the middle range?",
  "Where - -",
  "You say in your brief, which doesn't seem to me to comport with what you are saying here, for a judge to exceed the base range, for example, by applying enhancement or an alternative sentencing scheme, the predicate fact for the enhancement or alternative scheme must be pleaded and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. There's no indication there that the judge could just say, I think more deterrence is necessary and therefore, I'm going to exceed the base range. That's just totally incompatible with that.",
  "Well, but they have to be an aggravating factor.",
  "And to talk about the need for more deterrence as an aggravating factor, that's not an aggravating factor.",
  "That's not an aggravating factor. It's a basis for imposing a harsher sentence, but it doesn't aggravate this crime as opposed to the same crime committed by other individuals. It's not an aggravating factor.",
  "I think the California Supreme Court and the California legislature would be astounded to think that this is what they have wrought. They obviously intended to establish a scheme in which the judge would apply the middle range, not using his own perception as to whether more punishment is justified or not, unless there's some circumstances about this crime that make this person more guilty, and that's what you usually mean by aggravating circumstances, not the fact that you believe the crime should bear -- in general, should bear, a higher penalty. I think they would be astounded to find that this is what they have created.",
  "Would you want us to hold that, you know, that we uphold the system here in an opinion that says what California's sentencing judges may do under California law, as you've described it to us, is that they -- they may exceed the middle range whenever they think that that is a better result, whenever they think that that's reasonable?",
  "And you think California would be happy with that?",
  "Well, including reasonable disagreement with the level of severity that the legislature has provided in the middle term. I mean, other legislatures may have provided higher severity and the judge says, I simply disagree with the California legislature. And it's a reasonable disagreement, because some other legislature might have done what I do.",
  "That isn't reasonable? Why isn't it reasonable?",
  "He ties it to that. He says, I just disagree with the California legislature as to whether this is enough to prevent the defendant from committing this kind of a crime. And look -- and he cites another state which provides a much higher sentence for the same crime. Can that possibly be unreasonable?",
  "Then you don't mean reasonableness. You mean something else.",
  "Do you know of any case in which a California trial judge has gone beyond the middle range not on the basis of a fact that that judge has found, but rather on the basis of some general policy he thinks that the punishment should be greater, something along the lines of what Justice Breyer suggested?",
  "I'm not either, and I would be astounded if any trial judge would read these statutes and court rules that way.",
  "To apply an opinion of this Court to particular circumstances, and find that in the view of the court of appeals, it produces a certain result is not necessarily to say that that is clearly established Supreme Court law. It just means that it is their best guess as to how it comes out, right?",
  "I mean, they're forced to decide it one way or the other, the Supreme Court opinion either means this or that. They're not applying a clearly established test to the Supreme Court, are they?",
  "Well, you also don't allow people to come into most courtrooms in tank shirts, and we don't allow people to, you know, to wear beany hats. Everything that is inappropriate for a courtroom is not necessarily inappropriate because it would prejudice the trial; isn't that right?",
  "Maybe that's why we don't allow banners, because a courtroom is not the place for banners.",
  "I wish you hadn't said that. Because I had thought that one of the things that made this case leaning in your direction is the fact that merely having a picture of their loved one on the button doesn't convey the message, you know, hang the defendant, or even convict the defendant. It just conveys, at most, to the jury, you know, this is -- we have been deprived of someone we love, you should take this matter very seriously and consider the case carefully. It is an important matter to us. And therefore, you ought to deliberate carefully. I don't know that it means anything more than that.",
  "You said, you know, convict what's -- or hang What's His Name. That's quite -- you're equating that with the buttons in this case. And I don't think the buttons in this case say hang so and so, or even convict so and so. They just say we have been deprived of a loved one. This is a terrible matter. Please, jury, consider this case carefully. That's all it necessarily says.",
  "I thought some states require that the relatives of the victim be allowed to make their case to the jury for harsh penalty. I don't know that that's necessarily inappropriate to know that the - -",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "Repeated later in opinions for the majority, I think.",
  "In later cases, so I mean - -",
  "Don't just put it in Brennan's dissent.",
  "Yeah, but there is a First Amendment problem when you're dealing with activities of people other than the prosecution, people other than the state, who is bringing this prosecution.",
  "So that makes it a different case. It makes it very hard to say, well, the Supreme Court's already decided this matter.",
  "Sure, it may come out the way -- it may come out the way you want, but it's hard to say that the Supreme Court, any Supreme Court case bears upon it, when we haven't had a case that involves weighing the First Amendment right of the people in the courtroom to wear buttons or cry or - -",
  "Well, but that cuts against you.",
  "Let's assume -- risk of what? That's what I'm puzzled by. Let's assume that the buttons were big enough that they could recognize that the buttons were the face of the deceased for whose murder the trial was about. Let's assume all that. What risk is that? You know, during sentencing I can understand, oh, he caused so much grief to so many people, once we found him guilty, we should sock him with a stiff sentence. But during the guilt trial? I mean, I see, gee, the victim's family loved him a lot. This guy must be guilty. That doesn't follow at all. In the guilt phase, I don't see how that can have any effect on the jury.",
  "I don't see the possibility. You tell me that - -",
  "Is there a real possibility that a jury is going to say, since this man's -- this victim's family loved him so much, this guy must be guilty?",
  "Well, that's just because we haven't had a First Amendment case yet. I mean, we just have parties arguing in the context of the criminal trial for the defendant, for the state. Let's wait until the ACLU brings a case about people who want to wear buttons in court. Then you're going to have people arguing, people ought to be able to wear buttons, just as they can wear a shirt that says \"Blip the Draft.\"",
  "I don't understand why anyone would want to come out the way you urge us to come out. Why would it make any sense to give a Federal employee the benefit of trial in Federal court when he committed the act, and then you debate about whether it was, whether there was liability or not, and yet deprive him of the benefit of a Federal court when he denies that he did anything at all? Why would you want one set of cases to remain in the State court and the other set of cases to go to Federal court?",
  "Well, I mean, that's what we're debating, whether the line is there or not, and as you've seen from the discussion, there is at least some ambiguity in it. There being ambiguity, why should we find a line that doesn't make any sense?",
  "But that can happen when in fact the certification of the Attorney General turns out to be wrong and there isn't any immunity. Still, the whole thing is going to be tried in Federal court.",
  "Mr. Grant, these items we've been discussing are perhaps the more important features of the case. But your argument in your brief didn't begin with those. It began with the assertion that there is no jurisdiction to review the district court's remand order at all. I take it you're not abandoning that, are you?",
  "Then why was it first in your brief and not first in your argument?",
  "I would have thought your answer would have been even if, even if the remand was improper, even if it is the case that, what is it, (d)(2) envisions that the suit remain in the Federal court. Nonetheless, if there is an erroneous remand, it is still a remand that is covered by the prohibition of review. I mean, we said in other cases that even when the remand is wrong, the remand is not reviewable.",
  "What does that mean? Does that mean that if the district court finds that in fact the defendant was not acting within the scope of his employment, the United States is eliminated as the defendant and the individual employee is resubstituted?",
  "Where, where does that come from?",
  "Maybe the United States should remain the party defendant and the United States should pay which would be the, you know, the price of the Attorney General's certification. He should be careful what he certifies.",
  "That's, that's what the district court said it was, though, isn't it? Didn't it -- wasn't the district court remanding for lack of jurisdiction?",
  "So you want us to review the, the assertion of the district court that it was remanding for, I mean that would mean every case would, would be reviewable.",
  "Mr. Grant, could I come back for -- I'm sorry. I have the wrong counsel. Mr. Hallward-Driemeier - -",
  "What is your response to the application of 1447(d)? You say that it does not apply where it's apparent on the face that the remand is improper?",
  "Right, right.",
  "Wouldn't somebody always be able to bring an appeal asserting that to be the case - -",
  "And wouldn't that destroy the whole purpose of 1447(d), which is to stop this ping-pong?",
  "But the response to that is that our opinions show that even an erroneous remand is nonetheless governed by 1447(d). There are a lot of erroneous remands and this would just be, just be another one.",
  "Well, I guess this is probably not a question for you, but a question for your friend on the other side. You can ask, why does it hurt? You can also ask why does it help? What good does it do to bounce the whole thing back when you're just going to have them filed again?",
  "You would have no problem, I assume, if the state simply requires that you name the individuals?",
  "To the extent possible, I suppose.",
  "Then, then there would not be exhaustion unless he had named the individuals.",
  "So we may not be, may not be litigating about a whole lot here.",
  "Miss Olivieri, you also rely on the \"no action shall be brought\" language to justify dismissal of the entire action, all claims, even though only some of them have not been exhausted. Do you have any, even a single example of the many other instances where that language is used in the Federal statutes? And there are many of them. Do you know any other case where it's been interpreted that way, so that claims that are perfectly valid will not be retained, but rather the whole action will be dismissed?",
  "Right.",
  "What is the basis in the habeas context for dismissing the entire habeas application despite the fact that some of the claims have been exhausted? Is there any statutory basis for that or is it just, just judicial efficiency?",
  "But your answer was it shouldn't, I think. I think she's making your argument for you.",
  "I think she is saying that we should treat this area the same way we treat habeas, so that the whole case should be dismissed rather than just the individual claims, which is what I think you want; isn't it?",
  "Okay. Well, don't fight it.",
  "The same arguments apply in habeas, don't they?",
  "Not if you had your way.",
  "I think you're making an argument that it would preclude that too.",
  "So it seems to me that if we accept your response to Justice Ginsburg, we've got to go back and to the extent that we can do anything about it, we'd better toughen up habeas so that these things get thrown out more readily.",
  "And then sometimes it's impossible to complete the exhaustion. I assume in some cases that the time limit for the last appeal will have expired, right?",
  "It requires, it requires response in all the cases, and as this subsection G indicates, part of the purpose of the act was to eliminate the necessity of responding to frivolous complaints. Why -- why, you know, you have to go through the requesting a response from the government, when in fact there is nothing to this complaint because there has never been any exhaustion.",
  "That's a different argument. But I mean, don't tell me that it isn't more efficient to have the prisoner say at the outset whether it's exhausted or not. It certainly is.",
  "Well, I guess we could leave it up to them whether they want to disallow the instruction for a different reason, but the fact is they disallowed it for the reason that you say.",
  "And we can say that is error and remand it to them. That might not make you very happy, but it would be up to them whether or not - -",
  "No. If it had said that, I would have no trouble with it. What it says is, you may consider it in determining what the reasonable relationship is between the harm caused to Jesse Williams and the amount of punitive damages assessed. I don't see how injury to others can have any bearing upon whether the punitive damages bear a reasonable relationship to Jesse Williams' harm. That's my problem with it.",
  "I don't.",
  "The jury can't really find that other people were harmed. The jury doesn't have evidence before it except as to this person. The most the jury can find, it seems to me, is that the, the activity engaged in bore a very serious risk of harming other people. I think a jury could find that. And therefore, the activity is more heinous and should be punished more severely. But I -- you don't - -",
  "Yes, but I don't think I'm quibbling, but you seem to be conceding that this jury can decide that other people have been harmed and take into account the harm that it found other people suffered in deciding the penalty. And I don't think this jury has any basis for finding that other people were harmed. It could say there was a serious risk of it.",
  "You're losing me, counsel. What, what specifically is wrong with the instruction proposed here?",
  "As briefly as possible, one, two, three.",
  "Would it have been a proper instruction if the second sentence had read, although you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in determining what the -- what that reasonable relationship is, although you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in determining how heinous the crime, the action of the defendant was, and hence - - what, what that reasonable relationship is? If you had just added in that additional thought.",
  "It seems to me that's all that's left out of it. Now does leaving that out of it make it erroneous?",
  "Yes but reprehensibility analysis is part of the reasonable relationship. The more reprehensible it is the higher the ratio can be, according to our cases as I understand it.",
  "You're saying this instruction was too favorable to you - -",
  "-- because it allowed them to consider harm.",
  "And you don't think they should have been allowed to consider harm, correct?",
  "Counsel, it seems to me the point you're making is not the basis on which the Supreme Court of Oregon said the instruction was properly disallowed. The Supreme Court of Oregon said it was properly disallowed because you can take into account directly the harm to other people, isn't that the case?",
  "Okay. Why not?",
  "So your only objection is that they left out the reason why it is relevant to determining what the ratio should be? They just didn't say you can consider it in connection with reprehensibility. Why is that crucial?",
  "But why was it critical?",
  "Too favorable to you. Too favorable to you again, right?",
  "But what if -- your friend says, what if we never get assessed for any other case? Where do we make up this money?",
  "Suppose they win every other case in Oregon.",
  "You're saying the application is the application -- the petition for certiorari is the application?",
  "Well, we can't act on it unless, unless it's final. We, we need final action by the state court, don't we?",
  "How can it be final action and yet still be pending?",
  "It's final as far as the application for state review is concerned.",
  "Which is the text that we're dealing with here.",
  "I think what you're saying, though, is when you have ambiguous language, a sensible rule is not a rule, it has to have a lot of exceptions to make sense. Surely that's a sound principle, isn't it?",
  "Can I ask -- it seems very strange to me. I can understand protective filings when you've lost, but it seems to me a very strange protective filing. When you've won in state court and the government has taken certiorari, can you file, file in Federal district court? What do you say? What are you complaining about?",
  "No. It's their point. I don't see how it's your point. How can you cover yourself? I mean, if we come out your way, how -- how - -",
  "Would you advise a client that way? Would you advise a client that way?",
  "You've won here and the state is taking certiorari to the Supreme Court. Don't worry about making a protective filing in the district court because, you know, if by chance the Supreme Court reverses, equitable tolling will apply. You know, you roll the dice with equity.",
  "I agree.",
  "Is it, is it clear that he can go to district -- I mean, I'm not familiar with how these things work. Is it possible that when there is an appeal or certiorari pending here there can be proceeding in district court a habeas action on the same, on the same matter that we are considering on certiorari?",
  "District courts do that? I mean, they would be considering the same, the same issues we are, I suppose?",
  "You're sure that happens, that while cert is pending here there is a habeas proceeding ongoing in district court?",
  "Well, I mean, it sort of depends on how often cert is going to be granted, doesn't it? If you're a district court and you have hundreds of these habeas petitions being filed, you can either hold of them whenever a cert petition is filed, one in one thousand or whatever the number is, because they might be granted. I think you'd probably take your chances depending on the petition. If it looks serious and there's a petition pending you don't have to proceed. If it's frivolous perhaps you can proceed.",
  "Let me be clear on your answer to Justice Stevens' earlier question. Where there is a reversal of the state judgment by, by this Court, and the case is remanded to the state, you don't argue that what occurs then is equitable tolling? But you say that the case is again pending once it goes back to the state, is that right?",
  "I guess you could also say that except in capital cases the defendant will not have an incentive to delay. He wants to get out, right?",
  "Habeas is an equitable - -",
  "Habeas is equitable relief and the Court has a lot of discretion in identifying the boundaries of equitable relief, doesn't it?",
  "I assume that's how we got to Teague.",
  "Well, I assume there would be a Rule 60(b) motion or the equivalent of it in state court.",
  "If indeed our law had changed; don't you think?",
  "I mean, it's inconceivable that the problem wouldn't be solved in some fashion by the state court that rendered the decision.",
  "You're saying not just \"clearly\"; \"then clearly established law.\"",
  "That is, at the time of the state court decision. *END STENO",
  "Exactly. But you know, how you play the game depends upon at what level of generality you describe the right. And I agree with you if you describe the right as the right to cross-examination, that -- that was -- reinstituted by Crawford, which said that the confrontation right is a right to confrontation -- to cross-examination, which didn't exist before. I mean, you could dispense with that right of cross-examination if there were indicia of reliability.",
  "I'm not sure that you can so -- in such a facile fashion decide what is a bedrock principle. Frankly, I don't know any formula that would -- that would describe it. I really think it is a -- you know it when you see it.",
  "It is like obscenity. (laughter.)",
  "Is that the case in Federal courts, too?",
  "I mean, it is conceivable that Federal courts would interpret the hearsay rule to require precisely that anyway.",
  "In which case you shouldn't be making this argument because it applies only to state courts.",
  "Well, we didn't say in Crawford, I don't think we said in Crawford -- I ought to know, I suppose.",
  "-- that the new rule produced greater accuracy. We said that it was the view of the framers of the Constitution that cross-examination, confrontation in that sense, was necessary for greater accuracy. Now in our evaluation of what constitutes a landmark decision, are we bound to the framers' view of things? I mean, you know, maybe -- I'm not sure that if you apply a proper interpretation of indicia of reliability under Roberts, I'm really not sure whether it wouldn't be more accurate than confrontation, but that wouldn't matter to me, because confrontation is what the Constitution required and what the framers thought were necessary. Am I bound, for purposes of the rule we're arguing about here, to what the framers think?",
  "I think that discussion of the, you know, the contrary decisions that had been produced under Roberts was just for the purpose of justifying the overruling of a case that -- you know - - that was not that old. It hadn't worked out as well as we maybe expected it would. But I don't think it was for the purpose of showing that it always produces unreliable results.",
  "It is a little of an exaggeration, though, to say that EPA has since the issuance of the regulations always interpreted them the way that you prefer. In fact, the director of the PSD program gave two opinions in which he took precisely the interpretation that opposing counsel took.",
  "Rightly so, I think. I mean, it was the earliest, application of the regulation by the officer of the agency specifically in charge of the program.",
  "Well, whatever the reason he gave, was it -- these opinions were out there when the challenge to the regulations, in which Duke did not participate, when that challenge was brought, were these -- were those opinions already out there?",
  "I understand that, and I think you may have the better of the argument on me on the interpretation of the PSD regulations. But what I am concerned about is that companies can get whipsawed. They don't challenge the regulations when they come out because as far as they know, the agency is interpreting them in a way that they favor. And then some years later, when it turns out the agency is using a different interpretation, you have the jurisdictional bar.",
  "We've wrestled with these things for several days. It's disappointing to hear you tell us they're clear.",
  "Right. In deciding whether the regulations are reasonable, however, is it proper for a court to take into account that the regulations must follow the prescription of the statute that the PSD definition be the same as the NSPS -- what is it -- NSPS definition? I mean, that's a usual tool of statutory - - or regulatory construction. Cannot a court give great weight to that in interpreting these ambiguous regulations?",
  "Well, I don't think the same argument has necessarily to be made, but the question still before us is how you interpret the regulations. Let's assume that's just a regulatory interpretation question, it's not a statutory question.",
  "But in deciding that, whatever was argued in prior cases, it seems to me that we're entitled to take into account the necessity that the regulations comply with the statute. And if they are ambiguous, we should resolve the ambiguity in the direction that it seems to us would provide consistency with the statute. Now does that violate the jurisdictional bar?",
  "Why was that rejection wrong? Because this issue is still important to me for purposes of statutory construction. Is it conceivable that when Congress says the word widget in this statute has to mean the same as the word widget in the other statute, that the agency can effectively frustrate the apparent Congressional intent by saying, oh, yes, I mean, yes, that has to mean the same thing, but we can adopt regulations under one statute which regulations say it means one thing, and we can adopt regulations under another statute that says it means something else. I mean, to say that they have to mean the same thing it seems to me means that the regulations have to say they mean the same thing.",
  "Of course it does, but when Congress says the definition in the two statutes has to be the same, whatever choice the agency makes among those options has to be applied to both, it seems to me.",
  "Well, then it's meaningless to say the definition has to be the same.",
  "Entirely meaningless.",
  "Mr. Hungar, I'm curious. What happens if you have a new company that wasn't around when the regulation was issued? Can it -- can it bring a challenge to the conformity of the regulation to the statute?",
  "Well, a nice question. I mean, all you have to do is find a stalking horse. Just have some new company carry your water for you.",
  "Who was saying that?",
  "That's the NSPS section.",
  "They say that that provision only applies when there is no SIP. And that's not this case.",
  "I don't understand that. It seems to me each part has had different definitions and this definition only applies to part 52 which applies when there is no SIP.",
  "I don't know how you can say it automatically applies when there is a SIP.",
  "Part 51, in other words.",
  "Mr. Phillips, before you get away from this section 52, because I think that is the best section for your case, 52.01(d), is there, is there any sensible reason why you would want to have a different definition of modification for non-SIP situations than you would for SIP situations?",
  "That occurred to me when- -",
  "You're quoting page 9?",
  "Oh, in their reply brief?",
  "It's definitely no.",
  "Well, I think what's wrong with it is that you could have achieved that same result by simply not saying that modification in one program has to mean the same as modification in the other. If you didn't say that, that would be the result. You give modification whatever meaning you think is reasonable here. You give it whatever reading you think is reasonable in the other place. But when you say the two have to be the same, it seems to me you have something else in mind.",
  "It's not just a matter of using the same word.",
  "It's a matter of a statute which says it shall have the same meaning.",
  "-- to the PSD?",
  "Well, the one in part 52 surely does. You have to give them that.",
  "You don't give them that.",
  "Where is \"rate\" defined? I'm still troubled by 52.01(b). Where is -- you say \"rate\" is defined. Where?",
  "It's not defined. You say it's just used that way.",
  "But only if, only if the challenged evidence, the challenge to the evidence, if sustained, would necessarily -- and this is the crucial language -- invalidate the criminal conviction.",
  "Would necessarily have? You could have said that ex ante?",
  "You don't know what other evidence there might have been in the criminal case. Ex ante you can't tell.",
  "Again, you didn't, you didn't know that at the time the arrest was made, or at the time the confession was extorted, or at the time he was bound over. You really didn't know that until the trial. For all you knew, they might have found in addition to the confession, they might have found eyewitnesss who would have identified your client. You couldn't tell that until the trial.",
  "Until the trial, until the process of trial began.",
  "But the conviction in Heck existed at the time of the alleged tort. And what Heck said is where you have an outstanding conviction, and you have a constitutional tort, you can't sue on that constitutional -- and where -- you cannot sue on that constitutional tort if the decision on the tort would effectively contradict your conviction. Until the conviction has been set aside. Well, this is not that situation. There was no outstanding conviction involved. So why did you have to wait?",
  "Would he have to sue on the first one right away?",
  "Mr. Flaxman, before you save your time, I didn't understand why you're content with Justice Breyer's tolling situation, bearing in mind that the way he put it is, so long as the -- as the criminal case is commenced within the two-year statute of limitations, how does that help you when the statute of limitations has passed? Then there's no tolling.",
  "And two years doesn't seem to be unheard of.",
  "You're willing to let those people go?",
  "Those are the only defendants you are concerned about?",
  "Who is the defendant in a Fifth Amendment claim? Is it the policemen who extracted the confession or is it the prosecutor who introduced it at trial, since that is the offense?",
  "Right.",
  "They're not at issue as far as this mootness question goes. I mean, you're seeking to have the right to file under 13. And if, in fact, there's no eligibility to file under 13, you're asking for the impossible. The case is simply -- you know -- it's just air. So I guess, perhaps you rely on the fact that the case is still on appeal. Should we not take as a given that there is a judgment that you don't qualify for 13, and yet you're coming before us asking us to say that you can apply under Chapter 13. It doesn't make any sense.",
  "Well, didn't you make that argument to the bankruptcy court that found that you were not eligible?",
  "That's what I'm asking. A Chapter 7 debtor doesn't, but a Chapter 13 debtor presumably does. So didn't you make the same argument to the bankruptcy court.",
  "And they rejected it?",
  "I don't care about the present case. I care about the Chapter 13 case in which you have been found not to qualify for Chapter 13 treatment. Didn't you make before that court the same argument you're making now that some of the debts shouldn't be counted.",
  "They rejected it, right?",
  "And they rejected it?",
  "But you said it was only a Chapter 7 debtor who couldn't object.",
  "But you are applying under Chapter 13.",
  "Didn't you object to that and say you should look at these claims afresh?",
  "And what did the court say? Did it say it had to or that it did so and still found them over the limit.",
  "What did the bankruptcy court say?",
  "I don't understand that. But did it reduce it to a level that you qualified for Chapter 13 treatment?",
  "Of course you are. They've rendered a decision. How could you not be finished with the claims objection process if the bankruptcy court has rendered a final decision.",
  "It is terribly confusing. It seems to me that the Chapter 13 bankruptcy court had the responsibility for determining whether you qualified under the, you know, under the amount of debt.",
  "And you objected to that, I gather?",
  "You objected to that, to that ruling?",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Baker, I have -- I have a question on a matter that really upsets me and causes me to wonder how, you know, how much we can rely upon your description here. You claimed in the petition that the reason your client filed under Chapter 7 rather than 13 was that he was unemployed at the time. And that he decided to go to 13 after he became employed. Yet, on -- as shown in the supplemental appendix, when he filed under Chapter 7, under penalty of perjury, he said that he was employed, and at the meeting of the creditors, he confirmed under oath that he was employed. What was it? Was he employed or not employed?",
  "It says employment, occupation, name of employer: Capital Carpet and Flooring. How long employed, five months. Address of employment: Woburn, Massachusetts. It also says the same thing on page 18 of the supplemental appendix. And also with the meeting of creditors. If you look at the joint appendix at 64a, he says the same thing that he was employed. Was he employed or not employed?",
  "Does he go around swearing he was when he wasn't?",
  "Look on page 64a of the appendix, the meeting of creditors. Trustee says okay, and you now work for another entity, Capital Carpet and Flooring, sir? And Mark Marrama says yes.",
  "Was that Second Circuit's decision a decision that said the court didn't have the power because it had not been moved to take that action by the party who had the responsibility for raising the issue? Was that the basis for the Second Circuit's decision?",
  "Then -- then you haven't contradicted what the Chief Justice suggested.",
  "Mr. Brunstad, are you going to address the mootness point? Do you think the case is moot?",
  "Did you make the jurisdictional objection before the second bankruptcy court?",
  "How so?",
  "I find that extraordinary.",
  "This case, your case?",
  "What does the trustee do? He's not really a trustee under 13, is he?",
  "I mean, the property doesn't vest in him, you've told it. It remains in the ownership of the debtor?",
  "He's called a trustee, though?",
  "Well that's really not his capacity.",
  "It's called Chapter 13 day?",
  "Does the government have any position on the mootness question here?",
  "I'm not sure I understood what you just said. You said until the plan is filed and approved the property remains in the possession of the Chapter 13 trustee.",
  "Why does it make any less sense to allow separate habeas challenges to, first, the conviction, and then the sentence, than it does to allow separate appeals to this Court from each of those? And once again under the statute, we entertain appeals only from final judgment, but you can bring here on certiorari the judgment of conviction, even though proceedings for the sentence are still in progress.",
  "A fortiori, we have a lot more control over habeas corpus, which is an equitable remedy, than we do over, what is it, 1257, our jurisdictional statute under certiorari. Why does it make any more sense for habeas purposes to insist that he await the final sentence before he gets review of the premise for that sentence, namely the conviction?",
  "All right.",
  "But you're saying he can't later bring any claim about the sentence?",
  "But you wouldn't analyze it on the basis of whether this defendant started up the ladder. As I understand, you would -- you have to analyze it on the basis of whether generically attempted burglary as a whole presents a serious enough risk; isn't that the way it has to be done?",
  "But even if it would, that's only one manner of attempt. And it seems to me, if you're going to do it generically, you have to look over the whole scope of possible attempts and say does the whole scope of possible attempts bear, I would say, a similar risk of the use of physical force as do the specifically mentioned crimes of burglary, arson or extortion? Indeed, I guess you have to use the least dangerous. Wouldn't you say extortion is probably, of those mentioned crimes, burglary, arson, extortion, or the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct. Now that \"otherwise\", that refers me back to the crimes already mentioned, and I would say that means that the unnamed crime has to have a similar risk, at least a risk as high as the least dangerous of the crimes mentioned, which I would take to be extortion. Wouldn't you say?",
  "And what's a potential risk, by the way?",
  "A potential potential? I mean, every risk is potential, isn't it?",
  "You think potential risk is just risk really?",
  "It would also keep the professors from other mischief.",
  "I guess we have to decide how many attempts involve that kind of initial action, which doesn't seem very physical threatening, and how many of them involve putting a ladder up against the side of the house. How do we possibly figure that out, to decide whether as a whole the degree of risk from attempted burglary is as high as at least the degree of risk from extortion?",
  "Mr. Crawford, if you had that meaning in mind, you would not have used the word \"otherwise\". You would have simply said is burglary, arson or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk. The other purpose of the \"otherwise,\" which means in some other manner, some other manner -- other from what? Other from the preceding ones. I don't think there is any sensible way to read it except, you know, in some other manner than these previously named crimes involves a physical risk; and that is what causes me to say, well, what's the least dangerous of the previously mentioned crimes, and any crime you want to get into this residual category has to be at least as dangerous as that. As I've said, I think that's extortion.",
  "Mr. Crawford, we've held that the named crimes have to be considered generically according to their elements, right? Burglary, arson. Have we ever held that the residual category or \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury,\" that that has to be decided generically? I mean, if we could apply that residual category, not generically but according to the crime that was actually tried and of which the defendant has been convicted, such as laying a ladder up against the house, that particular sort of burglary, it seems to me it would be a much easier, much easier case, wouldn't it? We'd be able to tell whether there was a serious risk of physical injury. Is there any obstacle to doing that?",
  "Was it referring to the residual category?",
  "Maybe it's not too late to save ourselves from sending out legions of law professors to do studies.",
  "Don't you think attempted use of explosives is at least as dangerous as extortion? I mean as far as the risk of physical injury is concerned, I would think attempted use of explosives is much more dangerous to physical health than extortion.",
  "Mr. Marcus, it is a lot easier to do that with respect to the facts and circumstances of a particular crime than it is to do it generically -- you know -- picking out attempted burglary. It is very hard to do that. Why shouldn't we read this, this residual category to refer to the facts and circumstances of the particular crime of which the defendant has been convicted? The language enables you to do that. The term violent felony means any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of injury, physical injury to another. Why can't we not, not interpret that to mean generic crime, but rather the particular crime of which this defendant stands convicted?",
  "That would be fine if burglary were the only thing that Congress said there, but it also said extortion. And I think it absolutely fanciful to believe that extortion characteristically - - characteristically -- involves a risk of physical harm. I just don't think it does.",
  "Yes, but is the criterion \"characteristically,\" or is the criterion whatever minimal risk of harm there is in extortion?",
  "Is the level of potential risk the level that exists in extortion? Right? That's what the otherwise refers you to.",
  "The bes example where government has gotten involved in overriding what the states want to do is Casey. It seems rather odd for this Court to be concerned about stepping on the toes of the states.",
  "But we don't talk about a leg dying. We talk about the fetus dying, I think, and I think that's not the leg.",
  "When it's halfway out, I guess you can call it either a child or a fetus. It's sort of half and half isn't it?",
  "Would it, would it be lawful or would it be infanticide to deliver the fetus entirely and just let it expire without any attempt to keep it alive?",
  "I don't really see a vast difference between a promotion and being elevated to a higher pay grade. I mean, there may be no different responsibilities but it's a single act of discrimination: \"No, you're not going to move up to the next pay level.\" I don't see why that's different from \"no, you're not going to move up to the next job.\"",
  "How does, how does time solve that difficulty?",
  "But that, but that would not be the result if the reason for the disparity between 4 percent and 5 percent was not a, a denial of a pay increase to a higher pay level, but rather denial of a promotion to another job.",
  "If that were the case, then it washes out and you have to challenge it right away.",
  "Does that make any sense?",
  "Well, you could call it a secondary effect but the only reason you want to get promoted to another job is to get more money. I think it's a primary effect.",
  "So you too then have to go, unless you can find a present policy to discriminate on sex, you too in your proof have to go back whatever it may be, you know, the 15 or 20 years?",
  "Mr. Nager, why did it make any sense to treat this area any different from the Equal Pay Act.",
  "Mr. Gornstein, why should we listen to the Solicitor General rather than the EEOC? I mean, they have taken a different position from the one that you're urging upon us.",
  "Touche.",
  "Do you agree that their action is just based on Bazemore or their reading of Bazemore?",
  "They just have to say orally, I wish you would reconsider that? Because if that's, if that's all you're arguing, I don't see anything to be gained by -- by such a holding. It doesn't tell you -- you know, this is a suit against a number of large corporations, nationwide businesses, thousands of employees. And on this complaint you have no idea who agreed with whom, where, when, any of that. I can understand that you're saying that does not give us enough notice to prepare a defense. But if you say oh, but it would be perfectly all right so long as they said orally. I mean -- forget about it.",
  "Did you seek a more specific statement?",
  "Why not? Why didn't you ask when and where was this agreement.",
  "What do you mean can be held, can be thought to hold that? Is there any interpretation of what they did.",
  "And some parallel action would indicate that wouldn't it? I mean, if for example they, you have nine companies that change their price at the same hour of the same day, 10 months in a row.",
  "So you're, you're not saying that parallel action can never create this, this kind of - -",
  "But what if it didn't? I mean, I mean face the question that Justice Stevens puts. Suppose you have a complaint that says nothing else except that these defendants entered into an agreement in -- in restraint of trade.",
  "Mr. Barnett, I thought - -",
  "Mr. Barnett I thought you had, you had said that you don't need to indicate the particular day of the agreement. That it would be enough if it was the kind of parallel action that suggested an agreement that over nine years they all raised the price at the same time. Now that doesn't really give the defendant notice of, you know, what individuals were responsible for this, when it occurred. But you say that would still be adequate?",
  "Well, i mean, you know, that's shame on them. But we're trying to get this case right and, you know, I don't care what position they took before. I care about what the right answer is, and I find it difficult to believe that you can simply allege in a complaint, I was injured by the negligence of the defendant in driving an automobile, period. Does that satisfy the, the Federal Rules?",
  "Perhaps?",
  "The agreement happens at one moment in time.",
  "Meetings of the minds, meeting of the minds. I used to each Contracts. Meeting of the minds at one moment in time, okay.",
  "I think, by the way, that that argument applies not just to the keeping out the upstart claim, but also to the not entering the other alleged conspirator s' fields of monopoly, if you want to put it that way, because if I, if I enter your field I know that you're going to enter mine. It just doesn't pay for me to do it. Yeah, I can make money, but I'll lose money. It seems to me perfectly natural for companies that have a certain geographic area in which they are the, the principal, the selected instrument and although they technically can enter somebody else's geographic area, they know that if they do it they will be subjected to the same thing. That is nothing more than conscious parallelism.",
  "After several years - -",
  "I used to work in the field of telecommunications and if the criterion is that happens which Congress expected to happen when it passed its law, your case is very weak.",
  "Well, you need what is called the plus factor, and I gather that you acknowledge that if I disagree with you that this, this parallel action seemed to be against the self interest of the companies, you no longer have a plus factor and you would lose.",
  "So all you have to do to prove, to establish a plus factor is to say in your pleading, and there is a plus factor?",
  "You have to say what it is, that's all, and even if it's implausible?",
  "How much money do you think it would have cost the defendants by then to assemble all of the documents that you're going to be interested in looking at? How many buildings will have to be rented to store those documents and how many years will be expended in, in gathering all the materials?",
  "How does -- how does motivation enter into that analysis in that case? How would you, how would you have applied the motivation? I -- like Justice Breyer, I don't understand what the motivation -- motivation element is. How would you have applied the - -",
  "He had no particular motivation to use that earlier patent, did he?",
  "Mr. Hungar, I have a question that's sort of along the lines of Justice Ginsburg's. It isn't just the Federal Circuit that has been applying this test. It's also the Patent Office and it's been following the Federal Circuit's test for 20 years or so. What, what is -- assuming that we sweep that test aside and say it's been incorrect, what happens to the presumption of validity of, of patents which the courts have been, have been traditionally applying? Does it make any sense to presume that patents are valid which have been issued under an erroneous test for the last 20 years?",
  "You're right about that.",
  "Well, the claim goes beyond that. Your claim goes beyond the Asano combination and in your brief you, you, you discuss the case as though your, your limited claim 4 just relates to this invention that you, you -- nobody would have thought of using the Asano pedal in the Ford car given the limited space available and so forth, and therefore, this was really an invention. But that's not the claim. The claim is simply combining the, any pedal, the Asano pedal or any other one with the, with the automatic electronic sensor.",
  "But why Asano?",
  "You're the one that's standing up here making that argument. They're not doing it.",
  "You say its test is inclusive. I would say its test is meaningless. They have essentially said, our test simply reduces to what, what your opponents in this litigation say. If you think that's being inclusive, you know -- it doesn't add anything whatever to -- to the -- to the question, would a person of the ordinary skill in this field have conceived of this idea.",
  "Or anything else.",
  "So why don't you say that?",
  "It is -- I agree with the Chief Justice. It is misleading to say that the whole world is embraced within these three nouns, teaching, suggestion, or motivation, and then you define teaching, suggestion, or motivation to mean anything that renders it nonobvious. This is gobbledygook. It really is, it's irrational.",
  "It produces more patents, which is what the patent bar gets paid for, to acquire patents, not to get patent applications denied but to get them granted. And the more you narrow the obviousness standard to these three imponderable nouns, the more likely it is that the patent will be granted.",
  "Excuse me. You keep coming back to Asano. Why do you keep coming back? Your claim here does not say anything about Asano.",
  "I think they happened to use Asano simply because that's what you stuck it on. But I think their basis, their basic point, is anybody would have thought to stick it on, whether it's stick it on Asano or stick it onto some other mechanical accelerator mechanism.",
  "And in the last year or so, after we granted cert in this case after these decades of thinking about it, it suddenly decides to polish it up.",
  "But the claim doesn't require that.",
  "I assume it's a benefit to consumers if the supply of the needed goods is increased because of higher prices being paid for those needed goods, and I assume when a higher price is paid, more of those goods will be forthcoming, which will benefit consumers who want those goods.",
  "I presume it could lead to lower consumer prices too. If you have a firm that has developed a new, a new technique for processing the logs, and it can process them cheaper and faster, and sell them for a lower price but in greater volume, and thereby make even more profit, that firm would be willing to pay more for those logs, even though it would sell them for less than competitors might sell them.",
  "What do we do in the correlative situation where there is an allegation of predatory selling rather than predatory buying if you had the same situation posed by Justice Stevens? Namely evidence that you're trying to drive the competitor out of business, wouldn't that establish a violation?",
  "I assume you could have a company that has a dynamite evidence of seeking to monopolize and the means that they choose is just idiotic. For example, they say, we're going to try to get a monopoly by buying these logs at a lower price as, at as low a price as possible. You would have the two elements, monopoly power, intent to monopolize, but you wouldn't have an act that constitutes anticompetitive conduct.",
  "And that's what you're asserting is the case here.",
  "It's ultimately a jury question, I assume.",
  "But that question was not put to the jury, right?",
  "I'm losing you. What's the second point that they're trying to make besides the fact that this didn't conform to Brooke Group?",
  "Regardless of Brooke Group.",
  "I thought that the standing requires imminent harm. If you haven't been harmed already, you have to show the harm is imminent. Is this harm imminent?",
  "When? I mean, when is the predicted cataclysm?",
  "Well, there's a lot of conjecture about whether -- I gather that there's something of a consensus on warming, but not a consensus on how much of that is attributable to human activity. And I gather that -- what is it? Something like seven percent of the total carbon dioxide emissions are attributable to automobiles in the United States?",
  "6 percent? Thank you.",
  "Yes, but that doesn't go to the harm that you're claiming. I mean, we're talking about the, you know, the standing issue right now. And if you've been harmed, you've claimed harm because of carbon dioxide emissions, right?",
  "I understand, but that has nothing to do with whether you have standing. That has to do with the merits of the case. But on the standing point, only new cars would be affected, right? So even the reduction of the 6 percent would take a few years, wouldn't it?",
  "I understand. But it goes to how imminent the harm is and how remediable the imminent harm is. If, in fact, the 6 percent will only be reduced to maybe five and a half in the next few years, your - -",
  "Not in the first year.",
  "I mean ultimately, when all the cars currently on the roads are off and the new cars with, you know, whatever measures you think will reduce the carbon dioxide are on the road, then 40 percent would be the figure.",
  "I mean, do we know that that's a straight line ratio, that a reduction of two-and-a-half percent of carbon dioxide -- well, two and a half overall would save two-and-a-half percent of your coastline? Is that how it works? I'm not a scientist, but I'd be surprised if it was so rigid.",
  "What of a small landowner?",
  "No, I'm not sure -- I think our opinions have even said it, but certainly commentators have often said it, that really the far margin of our standing cases has been, you know, the famous scrap case, in which the allegation was that the added pollution from municipal incineration of municipal waste which would -- which couldn't be transported by rail for burial because the ICC rates were too high, that added pollution interfered with the students' - - they were Georgetown Law students -- their hiking in the George Washington Forest along the Blue Ridge. That seems to me a much more immediate kind of damage; yet that's been referred to as really the far margin of our standing cases. You're talking not about their being affected by ambient air but being affected by a stratospheric effect which then has another consequence that you allege.",
  "I don't understand that. You have standing whenever a Federal law preempts State action? You can complain about the implementation of that law because it has preempted your State action? Is that the basis of standing you're alleging?",
  "Do you know any case that has ever held that?",
  "Mr. Milkey, I had -- my problem is precisely on the impermissible grounds. To be sure, carbon dioxide is a pollutant, and it can be an air pollutant. If we fill this room with carbon dioxide, it could be an air pollutant that endangers health. But I always thought an air pollutant was something different from a stratospheric pollutant, and your claim here is not that the pollution of what we normally call \"air\" is endangering health. That isn't, that isn't -- your assertion is that after the pollutant leaves the air and goes up into the stratosphere it is contributing to global warming.",
  "Troposphere, whatever. I told you before I'm not a scientist.",
  "That's why I don't want to have to deal with global warming, to tell you the truth.",
  "Yes, and I agree with that. It is when it comes out an air pollutant. But is it an air pollutant that endangers health? I think it has to endanger health by reason of polluting the air, and this does not endanger health by reason of polluting the air at all.",
  "Well, it talks about air pollution all the time. That's what the, that's what the thing is about, air pollution. It's not about global warming and it's not about the troposphere.",
  "I think it can be argued that the Assistant Attorney General hasn't argued that here.",
  "He has said that 6 percent is enough.",
  "Can I ask about that? I found persuasive Solicitor General Garre's point that in the acid rain context, it isn't air pollution that harms health, but rather it is the effect of the pollutant after it leaves the air and produces the acid rain. Is there anything wrong with that response? It seems to me - -",
  "You concede that it's an air pollutant that affects health?",
  "Then why isn't it air pollution within the meaning of the statute, although whatever it is that causes acid rain is?",
  "But you can't give me any text in this statute itself. It isn't the phrase \"air pollution\" or any other phrase?",
  "And that gets us back to acid rain.",
  "So that's the position you're taking, that it is within the general term?",
  "I presume the problem that they have in mind is that we have nothing to give in international negotiations. If we have done everything we can to reduce CO2, you know, what deal do we make with foreign nations? What incentive do they have to go along with us?",
  "Mr. Milkey, do you want us to send this case back to the EPA to ask them whether if only the last two pages of their opinion were given as a reason that would suffice? Would that make you happy?",
  "I didn't think so.",
  "That's what I was asking, yes. And you think it will go back to them and they will say, oh my goodness, the scientific uncertainty is not enough by itself? You really expect that to happen?",
  "They said it already.",
  "The only question is whether that alone is enough.",
  "Well, I assume that the Federal regulating authorities require a certain ratio of loans to real estate value, things of that sort. And I assume that the States may have different rules with regard to that; right? In other words, the oversight might be different. The States may be more permissive as to certain loans or as to, you know, what the balance sheet of the bank has to look like than the Federal Government is. And if you have a State subsidiary that is overseen by state authorities, you might have a different result.",
  "Well, if not I don't see any advantage in this great Federal banking system you're talking about, if it's Tweedledum and Tweedledee.",
  "I thought your point was that the statute defines national bank, but also defines affiliates, and refers to them as two separate entities.",
  "And I thought your point was that the effect of this regulation is to simply eliminate that distinction?",
  "I didn't understand that you made this - -",
  "Mr. Blanchard, if I could go back to what you were saying before this last line of questioning, I didn't understand your position to be that the OCC can come in and regulate this non-Federal bank up to the point where its -- well, can do it apparently without limitation. And where its regulation conflicts with the state regulation, the Federal prevails.",
  "Ah, or the more restrictive.",
  "The Federal Government says you can have outstanding loans of $10 billion and the state says no, you can have outstanding loans of 8 billion.",
  "Wait. What happens in that situation?",
  "Well, invent some other hypothetical then. I'm talking about a situation in which the Federal law is more permissive than the state law. Which law prevails? The Federal law allows this bank to do things which the state law would not allow it to do. As I understood your prior answer, you say oh, of course, if the Federal law allows to it do things the state law doesn't allow to it do, the Federal law prevails. I didn't understand that to be your position. And if it is your position, I don't know what all this fuss is about. That's the end of the game, isn't it?",
  "Exempt from state examination?",
  "That's not the question. Justice Ginsburg is trying to find out if you know any other situation where when the Federal agency doesn't do an adequate job, the state agency comes in?",
  "Maybe civil rights actions where there's a Federal agency that has some remedial powers and if the Federal agency doesn't act, the citizen is free to bring litigation in state court? I guess that would be - -",
  "Did this go through your - - can I just ask - -",
  "This still goes to the same thing. Does Michigan do this by grace? If Michigan wanted to, could it just tell the feds to butt out and say, you know, all these years we've been letting you come in first, and we only step in when we think you haven't done a good job, but we've had it.",
  "Especially after this lawsuit, get out, we're going to regulate our state banks?",
  "I know in Michigan. I'm saying, could Michigan change its statutory scheme to kick the Feds out? Or would that be prevented by this Federal statute we're discussing here? I'm trying to see what you think this Federal statute does. Or what the - -",
  "I think, the question is not whether it can preempt State laws but whether the rulemaking authority can, can eliminate a, a basic division of the statute into a national bank and affiliates of the national bank. The statute makes a clear distinction between the two. And the effect of what, of what the agency has to done here is simply to eliminate that distinction, and to say really it doesn't matter.",
  "If you are an affiliate of a national bank, you have the same immunity that the national bank has. That's not what the statute says.",
  "I mean, an operating subsidiary is an affiliate, right? What kind of affiliates did they have before they had operating subsidiaries? Did they rent pool halls, or what?",
  "I would have thought that any affiliate of a national bank would, would be engaged in essentially banking business.",
  "What is a functionally regulated subsidiary of a depository institution.",
  "And is that a functionally regulated subsidiary?",
  "What comes next? Can the OCC say, well, the corporate law of this State doesn't really allow subsidiaries to do as much as we think a subsidiary of a national bank ought to be able to do, so we're going to attribute additional corporate powers to this subsidiary? Can it do that?",
  "What troubles me, and maybe you can answer to it more specifically than you have, is that the core function of a banking regulatory agency is the visitation power, and the Banking Act makes it very clear that there is visitation power to national banks and makes it very clear that there is not for subsidiaries. And here is a regulation which under the guise, it seems to me, of defining the powers of the national bank simply eliminates that distinction. And it seems to me that perhaps goes beyond what an agency regulation is allowed to do.",
  "You would object, then, to magnet schools? You would object to any system that is designed to try to cause people voluntarily to go into a system that is more racially mixed?",
  "No, I understand. But I'm trying to find what, you know, the outer limits of your contentions are. It doesn't seem to me that your briefs indicated that you would object to something like magnet schools. The -- even if one of the purposes of those schools is to try to cause more white students to go to schools that are predominantly non-white. It's just voluntary, I mean, but the object is to achieve a greater racial mix.",
  "I understand.",
  "Why do you agree that this is not an affirmative action case? Is it not? Wherein does it differ? I thought that the school district was selecting some people because they wanted a certain racial mix in the schools, and were taking the affirmative action of giving a preference to students of a certain race. Why isn't -- why doesn't that qualify as affirmative action?",
  "Well, I don't know what else it is. What do you think it is that causes you to seemingly accept the characterization that this is not it?",
  "I thought there was a criterion here, and that is, you can go to whatever school you want. You are allowed to go to a certain choice of school. The criterion was your choice.",
  "Of course they're not. That's why some of them were oversubscribed. That's why others were undersubscribed.",
  "General Clement, is there anything unconstitutional about desiring a mingling of the races and establishing policies which achieve that result but which do not single out individuals and disqualify them for certain things because of their race? Is there anything wrong with a policy of wanting to have racial mix?",
  "Mr. Madden, that's certainly an admirable goal. Could a local unit, a municipality, or even a State have another goal? Let's say what used to be great about the United States was the presence of various ethnic groups. I mean, there were the Pennsylvania Dutch, there were the Amish, there were Little Italy's, there were Chinatowns, and these things are beginning to disappear. And we think that we should encourage the continuation of that diversity, as the Federal Government has done with respect to American Indian tribes. And therefore, we're going to use public funds for such things as street festivals, a Chinatown street festival, an Italian street festival. We're going to encourage those organizations that maintain that separateness. Is there anything unconstitutional about that objective?",
  "About the objective? I mean, think we should foster separateness? Is there anything wrong - -",
  "Fine -- it would be problematic?",
  "Why?",
  "Please let me finish the line of questioning. Assume with me that it is not an unconstitutional objective, which I am sure it's not. Could the -- could the government achieve that objective by barring people from moving into Little Italy or giving a preference to some people to buy real estate in Little Italy if they are of Italian ancestry? Could it do that? Absolutely not, right?",
  "So it would appear that even if the objective is okay, you cannot achieve it by any means whatever. And the mere fact that the objective of achieving a diverse balanced society is perfectly all right, although certainly not the only objective in the world. The mere fact that it's okay doesn't mean you can achieve it by any means whatever?",
  "Do you have quotas for, for racial hiring of your faculty in these schools?",
  "Why not?",
  "To say segregated, segregated -- you refer to some of the schools as segregated. And I, that's not what I understand by segregated.",
  "I mean, you know, if you belong to a country club that, that -- that has 15 percent black members, I would not consider that a segregated country club. So what you are complaining about is, is not segregation in any, in any reasonable sense of the word. You're complaining about a lack of racial balance.",
  "That's the only meaning of segregation.",
  "You're talking about racial balance.",
  "Well, I think you're also - -",
  "What criteria of race does the school, just out of curiosity, does the school district use? I mean, what if a particular child's grandfather was white? Would he qualify as a white or non-white.",
  "I mean, there must be some criterion. There are many people of mixed blood.",
  "It allows parents to say I'm white, no matter what?",
  "Seems like a big loophole.",
  "Well, it seems to me you're saying you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs. Can you think of any area of the law in which we say whatever it takes, so long as there's a real need, whatever it takes -- I mean, if we have a lot of crime out there and the only way to get rid of it is to use warrantless searches, you know, fudge on some of the protections of the Bill of Rights, whatever it takes, we've got to do it? Is there any area of the law that doesn't have some absolute restrictions?",
  "But what about the Fourteenth? I thought that was one of the absolute restrictions, that you cannot judge and classify people on the basis of their race. You can pursue the objectives that your school board is pursuing, but at some point you come against an absolute, and aren't you just denying that?",
  "Mr. Gordon, isn't it the case that once you've achieved unitary status, which means that the effects of past intentional discrimination have been eliminated, the only way you can lose unitary status is to discriminate intentionally? Isn't that right?",
  "Do we know the race of the school board here? I mean, that was not -- how do we know these are benign school boards? Is it stipulated that they are benign school boards?",
  "And this doesn't? I mean, this which is somehow based on the notion that a school that is predominantly black or overwhelmingly black cannot be as good as a school that is predominantly white or overwhelmingly white? That doesn't send any message?",
  "You're talking about white flight, you're not talking about black flight. And what's going on here is makes sure that there are a certain number of white students or as high a proportion as you can get. In schools that would be otherwise be overwhelmingly black. And it seems to me if you are appealing to stigmatization, that -- that is based on an assumption that it seems to me is stigmatizing.",
  "Easy. Easy. Take a school district that is overwhelmingly minority. And - - overwhelmingly black, if you will. And a school board that reflects that. And in which by reason of residential patterns, the white schools, despite the same expenditure of money, same level of teaching and everything else, the white schools are better schools. And the school board could decide we would like our race to get into those better white schools. Not because we want mixing. We just want, want them to get into those schools. Wouldn't that be a situation in which the board could then come up with a -- you know, these good schools ought to have 80 percent blacks in them? I would not consider that a benign objective.",
  "I don't think there's a compelling interest in doing it at all. They're doing it for a racially selfish reason. They want their constituency, they want the 80 percent of black students, to be in the better schools. You consider that a valid interest, and a non-racial interest?",
  "If you say your plan has the overwhelming support of the community, does \"community\" mean those parent who have children in the schools?",
  "It seems to me that ought to be the really -- the people who are the objects of this experiment. Do they think it's doing - -",
  "And did the parents' satisfaction with it break out along racial lines? Or was it evenly divided?",
  "Where is that?",
  "And he's talking about the parents of students in the school?",
  "Mr. Mellen, I've been looking at Dr. Kiefer's testimony. Is this what you're referring to: \"There was remarkable agreement among every group in Jefferson County Public Schools about how desirable having diversity in the schools was\"?",
  "I have no double about that. I mean, if you're going to ask anybody, you know, do you prefer integrated schools or would you prefer lily-white schools, nobody is going to say give me a lily-white school. Of course nobody's going to say that. I was asking whether the parents whose kids can't go to the schools they want to go to, including the neighborhood schools, do they like this particular system of achieving the racial diversity? Is there any testimony about that?",
  "Black and white alike?",
  "How do we know that?",
  "It is in the record?",
  "It's not in your joint appendix here?",
  "Ms. Mahoney, let me ask you a question. Am I wrong about this? It seems to me that if he was not an original source, not only shouldn't he get any money, but neither should the government. Isn't that the way the statute reads?",
  "How is there any other possible one? It says there's no jurisdiction in this situation.",
  "It's not brought by the United States as long as he's still there.",
  "That's your argument.",
  "I guess it really depends on whether you think the language \"if the Government proceeds with an action\" is equivalent to the Government's bringing the action.",
  "Well, wait. It says under 3, what is it, (c)(3) I guess, if the elects not to proceed with the action, the person who initiated the action shall have the right to conduct the action. Now, that suggests that if the Government intervenes the Government is proceeding with the action, right?",
  "But you say that's different from the Government bringing the action.",
  "You're being very picky-picky with this text, considering that you're willing to swallow whole the notion that so long as the -- so long as the original party, so long as the non-government plaintiff drops out, all of a sudden it become as action brought by the United States. That's a very, very expansive notion of what \"brought by the United States\" means. What I'm saying is or, to put it another way, if you take your picky-picky notion of being brought by the United States, to be logical about it you must reach the conclusion that if you defeat the private plaintiff under -- under he's not original source, the whole thing is thrown out, not just his recovery but the Government's recovery.",
  "I know, but it would be so extreme that we're not likely to buy it.",
  "They don't have to give them any money, though. The court doesn't have to.",
  "But you'd then have to pay his attorneys' fees. That's what really this is about, isn't it?",
  "Factual theory of falsity, that doesn't mean anything to me.",
  "Am, am I correct that they were, in fact, using that same pipe or that same pipe system during a period when perfectly fine cement blocks were being produced?",
  "Is that true, is that conceded?",
  "You may find another one.",
  "Unfortunately, it was not the criminal conduct that was ultimately -- it was not the manner of criminal conduct that was ultimately the basis on which the Government proceeded? He knew about this bad pipe, right? Or he said that this was a bad pipe system? He didn't say anything as I understand it about their not adding enough cement which is the theory that went to the jury.",
  "Yeah. Let me -- let me look at what -- let me look at 175. This is, this what he says. \"After careful study, I concluded that the suggested process\" -- this means of piping the sludge out -- \"would result in an unstable mixture that would later deteriorate and cause unwanted release of toxic wastes to the environment. I also noted based on my analysis of chemical processes at Rocky Flats that that the sludge and liquid present in the -- present in the evaporation ponds contained some of the most toxic and radioactive substances at Rocky Flats.\" I mean, that's all very good, but it has nothing to do with what this company was convicted of, which is not -- cutting down on the amount of cement it was adding.",
  "During a certain period after this it was creating perfectly good blocks by adding more cement. Then they got a new manager who said let's use less cement. And that's when they started producing the defective blocks. It has nothing to do with his allegations.",
  "And why did the government claim it was insolid? What was the claim made for -- as to the reason for the insolidity?",
  "Was -- here's an easy question. Was this evidence that we read, his testimony from 175 of the joint appendix, was that introduced at the trial?",
  "Was this evidence introduced from some other source? Was the jury told there was this piping that was taking out too much liquid with the sludge? Was the jury told that?",
  "So his central allegation was not even placed before the jury?",
  "We've also said that jurisdiction must be maintained throughout the case. Something like standing. We say standing is examined throughout the trial. There's an easier standard at the beginning, and then for the complaint; and then for a motion to dismiss, a somewhat higher standard; and finally, if the facts of -- involving standing are tried, there's the highest standard at the end of the trial. I mean, it seems to me jurisdiction has to be assured throughout.",
  "Well, that's all very nice, but Congress didn't leave it up to you to decide who ought to get rewarded or not. It laid down some textual conditions in the statute. And unless they are complied with, the fact that you think this is the kind of person you think ought to get the money is really totally irrelevant.",
  "Let's take this case. Did the government use any of the evidence that Stone produced? Did it introduce that affidavit which said the pipe wasn't working right? Was that part of the evidence?",
  "Well, what else had he provided beyond -- did you use anything that came from him?",
  "But did you use at trial anything that he provided you?",
  "Did you use anything he provided you in order to prove it?",
  "No, neither am I.",
  "How is it possible to say that he had direct knowledge of events that occurred after he had left Rockwell? I mean, all of this failure occurred after he was gone.",
  "Not only not because of this pipe thing that he predicted would cause a failure, not only it was not because of that. But he was gone.",
  "That's right. And how would he know except from published report that these blocks were failing?",
  "But prediction is not knowledge. Prediction is not direct knowledge.",
  "And his sufficient information you assert is his prediction that these blocks would fail for a reason that turned out not to be the reason for their failure. That is what you say is his direct knowledge.",
  "So you think relators can get part of the Government's recovery even where their initial allegations before the Government intervenes have nothing whatever to do with the reason the Government is ultimately giving money? You think they are still entitled to a piece of the pie?",
  "So you don't believe that, then. You think that indeed the reason the Government was given the money has to be connected with, with his allegations? Right?",
  "Try this hypothetical. The relator says: I know that they've been cheating the Government because I, I observed the president of the company going into a meeting with the chief engineer and another person, and at that meeting I suspect they were devising this scheme to defraud the Government. It turns out there was indeed a scheme to defraud the Government, but that meeting never occurred. It wasn't the president of the company who went into the meeting. It was Charlie Chaplin. And the facts are totally, totally wrong. Does he get money?",
  "Does he get money just because he came out with the same charge that the Government ultimately proves? Simply because he said the company is guilty of cheating the Government, even though the facts on which he bases it are entirely wrong?",
  "Well, assume one that just gets over the line.",
  "It turns out to be entirely wrong. Turns out to be entirely wrong, so that the only reason he believed this company was defrauding the Government was absolutely wrong.",
  "What is your response to the Government's assertion, which seems to me quite true, that in order to -- in order to prevail it did not have to show why these blocks were not solidified?",
  "It just had to show that they weren't. So it doesn't matter whether they were using his theory or too little cement. It doesn't matter.",
  "I don't understand it. How can he be convicted of -- of the consequential crime if he is never charged with the consequential crime? You charge him with the -- with the theft and convict him of assault?",
  "Okay, well I thought you - - I thought you answered - -",
  "The theory being that anybody who intended to aid and abet a crime which naturally leads to another crime intended the other crime as well.",
  "And what about the remaining questions that were not decided by the Ninth Circuit?",
  "Do we remand for those or what?",
  "Mr. Himelfarb, you point out these last two issues are not, and probably correctly, that they are not fairly included within the question presented. Well, that would be disabling if indeed it was the petitioner that is seeking to raise those two additional issues. But here it is the respondent; and we can certainly reach those issues if we want to.",
  "The respondent can seek to uphold the judgment below on whatever grounds he wishes.",
  "So we can reach those other issues if we wish.",
  "Why wouldn't the better course be also not to decide the principal question you want us to decide on the broad ground that you want us to take, which is that if there are minor differences between what you might call the general law of aiding and abetting, it doesn't matter. Why wouldn't it be wiser to decide this on the simple ground that this kind of consequential liability is part of the general law of aiding and abetting, which you argue in your brief? So that would be the narrower ground.",
  "In that former question as to whether California theft is general theft, do you propose the same rule? That even if California has some minor variations -- not just in aiding and abetting but in what constitutes theft -- minor variations from what the general national rule is, they should be disregarded? And if not, why not?",
  "So you would limit your rule just to aiding and abetting and not to other minor variations, just minor variations in the aiding and abetting definition?",
  "Is it the sentence given or the sentence prescribed for the crime?",
  "Given.",
  "Could I ask a factual question? I'm just curious. If the Government's statement of the facts here is correct, your client, a Peruvian, was convicted of burglary in 1992 and convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon in 1994, and nonetheless was made a lawful permanent resident in 1998. How does that happen? Is that a mistake or - - how do we decide who's admitted as a lawful permanent resident?",
  "He's not a joyrider anyway.",
  "You shouldn't steal it for an unreasonable amount of time, just for a reasonable amount of time?",
  "I don't understand the concept of stealing something for a reasonable amount of time.",
  "You assert, you assert it's consistent with the majority view on this issue, not on everything. What does it say about the death penalty?",
  "The joy apparently is you don't get convicted of theft.",
  "Of course if you're right about this it would mean the statute is broader, but it would still be available to find out whether your client was in fact convicted as an accessory or as a principal.",
  "Now is that -- is it possible? Or is that out of the question in this case?",
  "Is it possible from pleading documents, from the charge, to determine whether he was convicted as an accessory or not? And if it's clear that he wasn't, then we're just wasting our sometime in arguing this point, aren't we?",
  "No, no, no. It says, \"who at the time and place last aforesaid did willfully and unlawfully drive or take a vehicle.\" I mean, he is - - he's charged with being the person who took the vehicle, not, not some subsequent accessory.",
  "It is not a question of Cal -- it is a question of English.",
  "We're not saying about what needs to be charged. We're talking about what was charged. And it seems to me there's no question what was charged is that he did willfully and unlawfully drive or take a vehicle. There is no way you can consider that an accessory.",
  "But the charging document you acknowledge would suffice if it indeed is California law that in order to convict as an accessory you have to charge as an accessory? You would acknowledge this?",
  "Partying maybe I would understand. I don't know about joyriding.",
  "Wait a minute. That's a real case?",
  "It sounds like the doctrine of unnatural improbable consequences.",
  "Let me tell you, what's aberrant is the California interpretation of the standard doctrine that is used in many states, which is you intend the natural and probable consequences of what you do. And if California has, some California courts have come up with weird notions of that, I don't know that that destroys the uniformity among the states.",
  "Well, I don't understand. You know, as far as the impact on out of State competitors are concerned, it's exactly the same. The State or the municipality runs its own waste disposal facility. There is no charge for dumping the waste there. The cost of it is entirely covered by taxes. Okay. Now, the people you're representing, out of state people who would provide dumping grounds for this waste, they would charge 9 dollars a ton or whatever they would charge. It would be more than what the municipality is charging. Now, why isn't that a restraint on interstate commerce, discrimination against interstate commerce?",
  "Oh, I'm sorry. You have to dump your waste in the municipal garbage dump.",
  "Okay, so that's fair. Even if they support it entirely by taxes?",
  "So that they're not competing in the marketplace in any way, they're not getting any money from the people who are dumping garbage. They get money from the whole tax base.",
  "Oh, it is indeed.",
  "I didn't think you'd be willing to go that far, but you'd say that that violates the Commerce Clause.",
  "You would say that they can do it so long as they charge less than out of State people - -",
  "-- and therefore people buy their services because they're cheaper. So long as they don't prohibit the importation, if they run the municipal facility on tax revenues, and therefore charge very little for the electricity or whatever they're providing, that's perfectly okay for you. Right?",
  "So long as they don't prohibit anybody from out of State.",
  "So don't call it a user fee. Call it something else.",
  "Call it a tax ripoff.",
  "Then you can charge whatever you want, so long as you don't call it a user fee, right?",
  "You know, there's a general agreement throughout the world nowadays that sovereign immunity, which usually applies to governments, doesn't apply when the government is engaged in a commercial activity. Now, why shouldn't something similar apply to government regulation which ends up discriminating against out of State businesses, when the government is engaging in a commercial activity it is subject to the restrictions of the Commerce Clause? Why isn't that a reasonable rule?",
  "You could do that by requiring all trash pickup to segregate recyclable and non-recyclable, and if it's going to cost each householder just as much trouble then there could be competition and you would have achieved your goal. No?",
  "You could do that by law. You could do that by law. You could specify that only certain waste facilities can be used.",
  "You don't have to run the business in order to assure that, do you?",
  "Why?",
  "So your answer is yes?",
  "It doesn't matter? Hamburgers are just as good?",
  "Whether they want the protection or not?",
  "And whether a private individual can come and offer them the same protection for less money or not?",
  "We're the government and we're here to help you?",
  "Let's take one of these classic discrimination cases involving milk. I think what you're telling us is that if Wisconsin adopted a law requiring all milk to be pasteurized at a facility owned and operated by the State of Wisconsin, that would be perfectly okay.",
  "That's right. And it would really advantage Wisconsin dairy farmers, wouldn't it, and really disadvantage out of Wisconsin dairy farmers, and you think that the Commerce Clause doesn't speak to that.",
  "So long as the government enters the commercial market, it can, it can create",
  "It always benefits the State of California.",
  "And you're saying so long as it doesn't benefit one particular malefactor of great wealth in the State of California, it is okay.",
  "I don't see the distinction as far as the harm to the national market is concerned.",
  "There is no determinative element in the Pike test whatever. It is a totality of the circumstances test, right?",
  "That's wonderful.",
  "A tariff is also imposed by a State, isn't it? As opposed to - -",
  "Money goes to a State.",
  "Mr. Waxman, I thought the Ninth Circuit did decide that question in another case that was pending, Santos.",
  "Why wasn't that the time at which it was clear that the Ninth Circuit no longer had jurisdiction?",
  "Except that she is removable by election, and that is indeed what has happened. And I understand that one of the issues in the election was precisely whether this borrowing authority existed or not. And if that's the case, you have a new attorney general that presumably as an original matter would not do what the prior attorney general did.",
  "So it is an intrabranch dispute that can be resolved by the electorate essentially.",
  "Please don't.",
  "What if, what if you have an ambiguous statute where it really is not clear whether it applies to pending cases or not? What, what -- you say if it turns out after the fact that it does apply to pending cases, you are out of time, if you haven't immediately filed here while the case is still -- is still pending.",
  "Well, you'd say Santos, then, is -- is -- is the Rubicon? Not the enactment of the statute, but Santos?",
  "Yeah. Your last argument, then, is irrelevant. I mean if it's clear, it doesn't matter what they did before.",
  "Which is not this case.",
  "But it doesn't have to be 100 percent. They could change what you call the tax valuation from 100 percent of the fair value to 150 percent. There's really much less to this case than meets the eye. I mean, Guam is going to be able to fiddle with this thing no matter how you come out.",
  "Well, whether it was their intent or not, is it not the case that Guam could say all property will be valued at 150 percent of its fair market value and we will then impose a 1 percent real estate tax instead of the 2 percent, or instead of the 1.5 percent we had before?",
  "I cannot imagine that if a territory of the United States goes belly up, that the United States is not going to foot the bill. I just can't imagine that.",
  "Could you tell me whether the rate of tax is uniform throughout Guam? The rate of real estate tax. Is it an island-wide tax or is it local, county?",
  "I don't know why you just didn't raise your assessed value from 30 percent to 100 percent and reduce the rate of tax accordingly.",
  "How would he make such a claim in this case where in open court he was asked by the judge, right, with nobody twisting his arm, whether it was the case that he did not want any mitigating evidence introduced? And he said, right, yes, that's correct?",
  "I wouldn't agree with it. I thought that the Ninth Circuit had been very clear that it did not agree with the district court's determination that he had waived mitigating evidence. I thought the Ninth Circuit simply disagreed with that finding and remanded for a hearing on the mitigating evidence.",
  "Isn't that so? I mean, that's what that -- one of the reasons the case was here, that the Ninth Circuit simply smacked down a district court factual finding that he had waived any mitigating evidence. Isn't that what happened?",
  "So it wasn't remanding for a hearing on whether he had waived mitigating evidence. It made the determination that he had not waived it, and then remanded for investigation into what that mitigating evidence would be.",
  "Well, it's clear at least that they disagreed with the finding of the district court that there had been a waiver, no?",
  "And it has not waived. Not that the district court was -- didn't have enough evidence before it. It says the foregoing, Landrigan has not waived the right to assert a claim for effective assistance. So how can you possibly say that that question is still open?",
  "The district court has to accept that he hasn't waived. And what it's sent back for is for all of the facts that show -- that show he had ineffective assistance of counsel.",
  "The criminal gene argument.",
  "I thought all that evidence was basically before the district court anyway. Didn't the district court know about all of that when it made its ruling?",
  "It's new to me also. I never heard of it.",
  "Some kind of waivers, like waiver to the right to counsel, we do indeed require a colloquy, because a defendant is not likely to know what consequences of foregoing counsel are. So the judge discusses with him and, you know, points out what a - - what a significant decision that is. But it doesn't take a whole lot of smarts to answer yes or no to the question, you know, \"do you agree that your counsel should not introduce any mitigating evidence?\" I mean, it's clear on, on its face.",
  "Well, unless the argument is, and maybe this is what the other side its going to argue, that -- that when you make waiver of all mitigating evidence, knowing as any person knows who's reached that far in the criminal process what mitigating evidence is, you must know, in fact, all of the elements of mitigation that could have been introduced. Which will almost never be the case. So that it's always possible after waiving the right to introduce mitigating evidence to come into the court a year later and say, \"Oh, my goodness, here's the sort of mitigating evidence I didn't know about at the time. My grandfather was a criminal. I didn't realize that at the time. And now I want\" -- you know -- \"therefore my waiver was uninformed\" and, you know, we go back to square one and try the case again. That would always be possible, wouldn't it?",
  "Excuse me. I'm looking at page 92 of the joint appendix. I don't, I don't see that.",
  "Well, that's rather important, don't you think?",
  "Is that effective? Does the court have to entertain a motion for rehearing?",
  "Isn't it your obligation to raise it in your original motion rather than in a motion for rehearing?",
  "But that wasn't your assertion even in this motion for a hearing. It wasn't that he didn't know what he was giving up. It was rather the sentencing transcript, you say, \"does not establish that Petitioner knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to present mitigating evidence. Rather, it shows that Petitioner gave up that right without thought, in the heat of anger, and in frustration with his attorney during that particular proceeding.\"",
  "But that was a factual matter best, best disposed of by the judge who was present at the time. And he didn't think it was in the heat of anger. He did think that it was a valid waiver. Now, you're raising a totally different issue. You're saying, oh, he can't waive validly without knowing all the elements of mitigation that the waiver might embrace. That wasn't the argument you were making here.",
  "Okay.",
  "This is belt and suspenders, that's all. The -- I don't think any judge likes to decide a case just on the basis of waiver. This judge is saying he waived it and even if he hadn't waived it there's nothing there - -",
  "-- because he wasn't bringing in at this point the biological -- by the way, biological proclivity to violence is a mitigating factor rather than an aggravating factor?",
  "I don't understand. It seems unreasonable to me. He was trying to spare his mother, what, the nervousness of testifying in court? That's what he had in mind?",
  "Excuse me. I'm not following you. You mean the mental health expert's testimony could have gone to whether the judge should have accepted the waiver?",
  "I thought that's what you were saying, I'm sorry.",
  "Where are you quoting from? I'm sorry.",
  "Mr. Verrilli, I thought you already conceded that the Ninth Circuit did not ask for a hearing on this question of whether he had waived, effectively waived mitigating evidence.",
  "That isn't what the Ninth Circuit said.",
  "It found that he had not waived mitigating evidence. So what - -",
  "Whatever.",
  "It might have been the allegedly defrauded Chinese court that found that the arbitration clause did not apply?",
  "It might have been the allegedly defrauded Chinese court which found that the arbitration clause did not apply.",
  "I don't see how that court would have gotten into the act unless that was the case.",
  "It was not, not felicitously put. I think all the Court was saying was that there would no need for a doctrine of forum non conveniens where there is no personal jurisdiction. The only point of the doctrine is to get rid of the case where you -- where you do have jurisdiction. And so you do not have to -- but that doesn't mean that you must establish jurisdiction before you can exercise the doctrine. It is a doctrine that overrides the existence of personal jurisdiction. In that sense, it presupposes personal jurisdiction.",
  "Now, why is that? Now - - to some extent this is a call for the district judge. There is a degree of discretion involved in it, and it's entirely conceivable that one district judge would correctly dismiss the case for forum non conveniens whereas another district judge faced with the same question would not do so. And both of them would be acting lawfully; isn't that -- isn't that conceivable?",
  "Well, that only proved that an appellate court can affirm on grounds other than the ground relied upon by the district court, even if the ground relied upon by the district court is also a valid ground. It's up to an appellate court -- - it's available to an appellate court, especially where the ground is jurisdiction, to choose to look into jurisdiction and say there isn't any. I don't know, I don't know how that adds to your case.",
  "Well, you found one appellate court that chose to do it that way. Frankly, if I were sitting on an appellate panel I wouldn't do it that way if I thought the forum non conveniens ground was valid.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, why -- I mean, I assume that in deciding forum non conveniens -- that there is an inconvenient forum, the court making that judgment would assume that there was personal jurisdiction and would simply say, you know, put that into the mix. Assuming we have personal jurisdiction, is this nonetheless an inconvenient forum? And if the court can say yes, that's the end of the game. I don't see what you have to gain here. Suppose the Court does decide that it has jurisdiction and dismisses for forum non conveniens? What, what - - what are you gambling for here? I don't understand what's the -- what's the desirable outcome you hope to achieve?",
  "Right, and the district court at best for you, at best, finds personal jurisdiction. If it finds no personal jurisdiction, you know, it dismisses for that reason instead of for forum non conveniens. If it finds personal jurisdiction, it would say: Oh, there is personal jurisdiction; but I assumed there was personal jurisdiction when I dismissed it for forum non conveniens, so this is really the same call that I made before. Dismissed for forum non conveniens.",
  "Yeah, but discovery for its own sake is no fun. What does discovery for its own sake achieve?",
  "Unless there's something at the end of the discovery. Now, maybe what you hoped is that the Republic of China would not accede to the discovery and therefore, you would get a default judgment or something. You know, I just -- I just don't see what's at the end of this game for you.",
  "I guess we should ask the other side, but I think I know what their answer will be, whether if the Court does dismiss on the basis of forum non conveniens without first addressing personal jurisdiction, it must assume the existence of personal jurisdiction? And what do you think?",
  "Yes, I agree.",
  "I agree. So how are you going to get a different result then when it goes back and the court of appeals says, oh, yes, you had personal jurisdiction, just as you thought you did, whereupon the district court says, oh, yeah, same result.",
  "Before you get into the substance let's -- let's finish with this, this problem, whether it was indeed the other Secretary's own bill. Was the Secretary who proposed the -- the '94 legislation, the same Secretary who had promulgated the prior regulations?",
  "The prior regulations were promulgated when?",
  "My goodness, that's a long time before.",
  "With a different Secretary now.",
  "So there's no reason to believe that the same Secretary -- that the Secretary continued to have the same view of what was proper, is there?",
  "Indeed he could have copied the regulations that were on the book and just put them in the statute, couldn't he?",
  "Was this the same Secretary, by the way, as the Secretary who issued the new regulation, the same Secretary that was in office when the new legislation had been proposed?",
  "Why, why would the Secretary, if indeed it was his bill, why would he deprive himself of the power to decide what the formula should be? Which is the power he had before. I mean, one must think that there must have been some pressures from elsewhere when the Secretary goes in and says take some power away from me, please.",
  "Counsel, I thought you said that you did know what it was. I thought you simply quoted the statute, the 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the State. That's what's being distributed.",
  "Such revenues or expenditures in the State consist of, the word \"such\" obviously refers you back to some prior reference to revenues in the State, and that prior reference in subsection A is a reference to district by district, not pupil by pupil.",
  "I thought the problem was disparity in school districts. Since much of the funding for education is local funding, in some places there are very rich school districts and very, very poor, poor school districts. And I thought that the purpose of this was to make sure that there is not an enormous disparity, not pupil to pupil but district to district. It makes perfect sense, it seems to me.",
  "Mr. Srinivasan, you don't want us to stretch the language, do you?",
  "And you wouldn't urge us to do either, would you?",
  "Different purposes.",
  "They're for different purposes.",
  "I still think it cuts against you rather than for you, the fact that they could have done the same thing here and we wouldn't have this case.",
  "Mr. Srinivasan, if we could come to the, to the text that you're talking about.",
  "What I don't understand about the Government's position is why you use this, this per pupil theory for purposes of (B)i), but don't use it for purposes of (A). You, you don't -- in the major computation portions, namely for purposes of paragraph 1, a program of State aid equalizes expenditures among local expenditures, if in the second fiscal year is made the amount of per pupil expenditures made by or per pupil revenue available to, you do it agency by agency, don't you? You DON'T apply this, you know, it depends on how many pupils in each agency. Why don't you do for both?",
  "Right.",
  "You're saying it comes to the same, but the fact remains you don't use that methodology in A, because you don't think the language requires that methodology. And it is the same language in B.",
  "Well, the purpose would be to follow the language of the statute, and if you think that the language in B requires this kind of an approach you should take the same approach in A, especially if it makes no difference.",
  "Would such be -- of such expenditures or revenues. That refers back to local educational agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues. It's referring you back not to the totality of students but to, to agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues.",
  "Well, you still have a Church of the Holy Trinity team over there somewhere, don't you?",
  "You know, I really don't care what the Secretary thought he was doing. I mean, it seems to me we have to ask the question, what would a member of Congress who voted on this thing have thought he was voting for, who had, you know, didn't have this history you're giving us. And more importantly, what would a citizen to whom this language is promulgated think the language means? I don't care what the Secretary had in the back of his mind. Why should that make any difference to us?",
  "Of such expenditures or revenues.",
  "So you've got to find out what \"such\" refers to.",
  "Let me - -",
  "Let me ask you the same question I asked -- I asked the Government. Why don't you, if this is a natural reading, why don't you apply it to, to 2.A? You don't even think of doing that in 2.A. In 2.A you just look at the individual agency, but it's the same language in 2.A.",
  "I'm surprised that that's the -- I would have thought its primary purpose would be to spare individuals the necessity of supporting causes that they don't support. Was there no First Amendment interest.",
  "Is it only an election law interest?",
  "But you just said the State Supreme Court was wrong. I mean, why do you believe it on this if you don't believe it on everything else? You're appealing from it, aren't you?",
  "Let, let's assume that it makes a difference whether the purpose of the statute was at least in part to protect the First Amendment rights of the non-union members or whether, as the Washington Supreme Court seemed to say -- at least they said its principal purpose was to protect the voting process. Elsewhere in its opinion, however, the Washington Supreme Court says where a statute is ambiguous and this court is able to construe it in a manner which renders it constitutional the court is obliged to do so, which sounds to me like good law. Wouldn't that apply to its intuition as to what the intent of the people who enacted this statute were?",
  "Wouldn't the Washington Supreme Court be obliged to intuit that purpose which would make it constitutional rather than unconstitutional?",
  "Are the courts in Washington State elected, do we know that? Are they elected?",
  "They are elected, so it's easier to blame it on us than it is for them to say, we hold as a matter of Washington law that this can't be done and we disallow what the people have voted for. That would be harder, a harder call, don't you think?",
  "Or even nongermane political expenses.",
  "Well, are there any other such entities that are given the power by the State to collect money from people against their will?",
  "Is it content discrimination which subjects legislation to strict scrutiny if the Government, Federal Government or a State designates certain funds for use by school districts to teach patriotism, American history, something like that? Is that subject to strict scrutiny?",
  "Okay. Now let's assume it's not Government funding. Instead of doing that the Government says, you will have authority to collect money from certain people only for a particular purpose. Is that content discrimination which calls into play strict scrutiny?",
  "I don't see why the one is any worse than the other. The Government has a particular purpose in mind and in one case it gives out money with that purpose in mind, which discriminates of course; in the other case it allows this extraordinary power to exact funds from people, but only for certain purposes. That's not the kind of content discrimination that they calls strict scrutiny into play, it seems to me.",
  "Here is the Government acting as a coercer. It's because of the Government that you're allowed to get this money from these non-union members.",
  "Which no longer exists if you don't make a timely objection.",
  "Only if the State has given you the power to exact the money from these people. That changes everything. If this was money that they had contributed themselves, you'd have a different argument, but the State compels them to give you that money and the State says however, you will not use this money for this purpose without their consent.",
  "That brings us back to the question I asked earlier and I suggested in my answer to that I don't think it's content discrimination of the sort that triggers strict scrutiny when the government gives money for a particular purpose only and not for other purposes, and I also don't think it's content discrimination of the sort that triggers strict scrutiny when the government allows a private organization to use governmental power to exact money from people for a particular purpose only. That's a different ball game.",
  "That's my understanding, too. I think you got to get out of it some other way. I mean, you've got to say it's content but it doesn't apply when it's the government contributing money or it doesn't apply when you're applying it to money that's being coerced by the government.",
  "Can you get to the point you were about to make, what the purpose of the thing is?",
  "That's not in the materials, 502(c)?",
  "Well, it's also used in the phrase \"knowing and willfully.\" That appears in several other parts of the statute, and that wouldn't make any sense if the only meaning of willful is knowing.",
  "In one formulation or another, but it combines the two words, knowing and willful.",
  "You mean willfully alone?",
  "Where -- where it -- where it means what you think it means, which is knowingly, that does not mean knowing the facts? If you mistake the facts and are laboring under a misimpression of the facts, you have nonetheless willfully violated the law?",
  "How about reckless disregard?",
  "Suppose there is a fair ground for believing it was lawful. Lawyers are in disagreement, but in fact, I believe the lawyers who say it is unlawful, and I nonetheless go ahead and do it. Is that a willful violation?",
  "But I think I'm violating.",
  "I'm a better lawyer than my advisors.",
  "Would you look to the subjective intent of the actor at all?",
  "Or would you just look to the outcome and say, well, you know, it was a close question, so even if the actor indeed thought he was in violation, it was a close question; it's okay?",
  "I must say that -- that is not the normal meaning of willful, willfully violating the law.",
  "You're changing it to mean willfully, willfully and blatantly violating the law.",
  "I mean, if I know that what I'm doing is in violation of the law, even if it's a close question, it seems to me I am willfully violating the law.",
  "How do you fit, how do you fit that within the language of the statute? Is it, I fail -- you're a first- time customer and I fail to give you a, you know, a break that maybe you could have had. Is it a denial or cancellation of insurance? No. Is it an increase in, an increase in any charge for insurance? Is it a reduction or other adverse or unfavorable change in the terms of coverage or in the amount of any insurance? I find it hard to shoehorn your case into that language.",
  "I read the term as, as one of the Justices here does, not referring to the rate. The earlier part refers to the rate. An increase in any charge for, that's the rate. And then it speaks of change in the terms of coverage. I mean, that is, you know, whether it covers hurricanes, or in the amount of the insurance, whether you're insured for - -",
  "Which is where?",
  "Thank you.",
  "It's pretty sloppy lawyering, don't you think, any action that even be considered to have -- wow. This is a standard?",
  "Any action that can even be considered to have a negative impact.",
  "This is guidance?",
  "But you know, I would tell my CEO ignore that, that it's meaningless.",
  "Tennard, Tennard was decided after the State decision here, wasn't it?",
  "And where is -- this is an AEDPA case, isn't it?",
  "So we're, we're asking whether this State court made an unreasonable decision at the time, and at the time regardless of what the Fifth Circuit has now said, at the time under Johnson, and -- and there is another earlier case, we said that you didn't have to give full mitigating effects; as long as there was some manner in which mitigating effect could be given that was enough.",
  "So I think Tennard is utterly irrelevant even if it is right.",
  "Did Tennard purport to overrule Smith, even when it came down? It simply, it simply quoted language of the Justice O'Connor's concurrence in an earlier case. It certainly didn't purport to overrule Smith?",
  "I'm sorry, Johnson, not Smith.",
  "It's absolutely one step removed from that.",
  "I say the actual question is even one step removed. It's whether it is unreasonable to conclude otherwise than what you conclude, which is wrong.",
  "But unreasonable.",
  "I guess striking a big person is not quite as bad as striking a little person.",
  "Did they find it could or did they find that it did? I thought our holding was that given the instructions, the jury would not necessarily take into account those mitigating factors, and I thought that what the Texas court held is, yes, that was a possibility, and we have to see whether that possibility came to pass, which is what harmless error analysis involves.",
  "So they are not contradicting the fact that the jury wasn't required to take it into account, but they are saying nonetheless, in our view, the jury did take it into account, and therefore, the error was harmless. That doesn't contradict our opinion. I mean, you might want to argue against it on the merits, but I don't think that will contradict our opinion.",
  "That's right. And that means that the jury was not instructed to take it into account. And I think the Texas court is conceding that. But it's, it's saying, nonetheless, we don't think that the error made any difference because, in our view, the jury did take it into account.",
  "Yes, but it seems to me it's one thing to use it for the purpose of saying the instruction was okay. And it's something else to use it for the purpose of saying even though the instruction didn't require that, it was a fuzzy instruction and a juror could very reasonably have understood it not to allow nullification, nonetheless, we have satisfied ourselves that the jury indeed thought it had the nullification power. I don't see how it contradicts our opinion.",
  "They didn't say it was an adequate vehicle. I mean, they acknowledged that that instruction shouldn't be given again because it doesn't require the jury to do what, what you say the jury must do, and I think they accept that. They say, oh, no, I thought it was fuzzy, and didn't require -- we think the jury did indeed think it had the power to nullify.",
  "And, and this was unpreserved error. I mean, they are not saying this for everything. They are saying he did not object to the instructions at the time and therefore our harmless error standard is -- is more rigorous than it would otherwise be. What's unreasonable about that?",
  "Yes, but that's a very generalized argument, and what he won on was a very specific point that, that this instruction in effect required, if they were going to give mitigating effect, required a jury nullification. That's a very specific point.",
  "He did not object -- he did not object to that specific problem. Had he objected, the court would have said, you know, there is something to what you say, and I'll give a different instruction. But he didn't.",
  "Do we make up our own procedural rules, too? I mean, why, why -- why is it just a Federal judgment as to whether it adequately complied with the Texas rule? Presumably we should make up our own rule.",
  "Why not? You say it's a Federal question.",
  "That's -- that's a little bit different from your, from your response to Justice Souter. You are making a much narrower argument. You, you don't - -",
  "You don't assert that in every case when there is a procedural objection in a capital case or any case involving Federal law, Federal law will determine whether the procedural objection is adequate?",
  "Well, I just don't -- you say whenever, whenever a court decides the case on the merits instead of using an intervening procedural objection, the procedural objection is waived.",
  "Especially in capital cases, courts don't like to say, oh, you know, yes, you may be innocent but there's this procedural objection. I think most courts - -",
  "Well, it's my experience with a lot of courts.",
  "Who gives the State court the power to, as you say, waive that objection? I can understand when you say the prosecutor didn't object. It's the prosecutor that has the power to forfeit certain arguments on behalf of the people which he chooses not to raise.",
  "Well - -",
  "Is there some reason, Mr. Schaerr, why that would be more egregious when the Federal constitutional question has been answered by a Federal district court than it is when the Federal constitutional question has been answered by the State supreme court? Wouldn't it be just as bad when the State supreme court has said the Federal Constitution has been violated and then the case goes back to the lower State court and the lower State court applies some standard for plain error which is, which is simply different from what is, what is being urged here today. I'm sure that happens all the time.",
  "And I don't know why it's any worse, any worse when you do it to a Federal district court's determination of what the Federal Constitution says than when you do it to the State supreme court's determination of what the Federal Constitution says.",
  "Well, we haven't had the issue before us, have we? That's why you're here.",
  "Well, that reason would apply equally, however, to determinations of Federal rights by State courts.",
  "And I think everybody understands that State courts do this all the time, and indeed a good way to do an end run around what, what, what the other side in this case seems to want is simply for the State supreme court to find a violation of Federal law so that it doesn't get to a Federal court and then have the State lower court apply whatever harmless error standard it wishes, which would be a crazy system.",
  "So if you're going to adopt this rule, this rule would have to be adopted not only for references back to the State court from a Federal decision, but you would surely have to apply it to all State determinations of Federal law, and I don't really know what authority we would have to require lower State courts to do that.",
  "In any case, you -- you, you are not driven to the alternative that Justice Breyer suggests, that there is no way to achieve absolute uniformity. It's very easy. It was what the dissenters in the Booker remedial phase urged, which is use facts found by the jury and you can have the sentences as rigid as you like. It is really only, only when you want to let the facts be found by the judge that you come into the difficulty that, that we're arguing about. But it's certainly not decreed by logic or by heaven that there is no way to achieve determinate sentencing. There certainly is.",
  "You don't -- you don't have to engage in our dispute here.",
  "As closely as it can, and the \"as it can\" depends upon violation of the Sixth Amendment by entitling defendants to sentences determined by facts found by a judge instead of a jury. Suppose in this case the court of appeals instead of disallowing the lower sentence, approved it? And then in the next case that comes up involving what was the small amount of equivalent, 5.26 grams of cocaine powder rather than crack, okay? Suppose in the next case it would have been 30 grams of powder. And the district court judge once again departs just the way the departure was here, and the court of appeals says no, that departure is unreasonable. You now have circuit law which says 30 grams, you get the guidelines sentence; 5.26 grams, you're entitled to a lesser sentence. Okay? Why isn't -- why haven't we fallen back into the same problem that produced Booker/Fanfan? You have fact findings being made by the judge. It's a judge who decides whether it's 30 grams or 5.26 grams. What difference does it make whether that factual difference produces an entitlement to a sentence on the basis of the guidelines or on the basis of an opinion by or a series of opinion by a court of appeals? Isn't the Sixth Amendment equally violated?",
  "But if you have two cases that are in other respects similar, and the court of appeals has held 5.26 is too little to apply the guidelines, it's okay to depart downward the way this judge did, it seems to me that the next case that comes up, the defendant has an entitlement to that lower sentence.",
  "Why, why do we assume that the district judge cannot depart from the guideline recommendation unless he thinks the guideline recommendation is unreasonable? He doesn't -- does he have to find it's unreasonable? There can certainly be two reasonable sentences; and he's under no obligation to select the guidelines sentence, is he?",
  "So he doesn't have to determine that it's unreasonable. I don't think we should approach the discussion as though that's, that's the situation.",
  "But what happens when that case -- it goes back down to the district court. The district court says well, okay, not 10 years. Nine years. Okay? It goes back up. I mean, you know, when do we end this game? Or does the court of appeals take over the sentencing function and specify -- you know, five years?",
  "Well, it wouldn't be, just be procedural only. You -- you could say procedural plus, you know, certainly review of the facts on, on which the district court was -- was proceeding. So you, if you could find that the determination that this was just a good kid who made a mistake is, is an unreasonable finding, you could reverse for that reason.",
  "How do you reconcile the language in the prologue of (c) which says, the court shall state the reasons, with (c)(2), which says that if the sentence is not of the kind or is outside the range described in (a)(4) of the guidelines, the court shall state the specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from the guidelines? Now, this seems to set up some dichotomy between giving reasons and giving the specific reason. Where does that line fall in your estimation?",
  "You haven't answered my question. I mean, you explain why it's put in there, but I want to know what is the difference between giving the reasons and giving the specific reason.",
  "Mr. Cochran, I have this concern: If we accept your submission that the district court should just consider the guidelines together with everything else, give them a presumption of validity, anything else, just something to consider, that would presumably eliminate any Sixth Amendment problem with the district court's findings of fact. But the district court's sentence is going to go on appeal. And the appellate court in reviewing it for reasonableness, let's assume in this case the appellate -- the appellate court says oh, no, this person had -- we find as a matter of fact, given the record, military service, you know, which we think should have been taken into account. And, therefore, we set it aside. Now, the next case that comes up, which doesn't have the element of military service, in all other respects the same as your client's case, it comes up to the court of appeals, and the court of appeals would say, ah, we don't have that different fact here and therefore we affirm the sentence. Isn't -- in other words isn't the finding of a fact necessary for the process of judicial review, even if it is not made necessary for the purposes of the district court's determination? He would not get that sentence but for this fact.",
  "So you haven't shown us a way out of the problem.",
  "No, even if you don't - - don't establish thresholds by reason of the guideline, you are establishing thresholds upon judicial review, guidelines or not. If the -- if the appellate court says, oh, given there's this fact in this case, the sentence below was reasonable, but in the next case, where that fact does not exist, the court of appeals says, ah, the sentence is unreasonable, in other words, that fact is made a necessary condition for giving the higher sentence. So you haven't -- you haven't solved the problem of the, of the apparent conflict between - - between Booker and the advisory guidelines.",
  "You're not focusing on my point. I concede that the district court is free as a bird -- free as a bird -- but you have appellate review. And the appellate court in reviewing for reasonableness is going to make a particular fact determinative of whether this sentence can stand or not. Isn't that right?",
  "And that's going to be a problem.",
  "Well, it did incorporate them in that district judges were free to depart from the guidelines if indeed they found there was some one of these human factors not considered by the guidelines which existed in the particular case.",
  "Well, if they were systematically removed then all of these other human factors that you're complaining about were considered by the guideline commission and were simply rejected.",
  "And presumably cannot give weight to factors that the commission decided should have weight.",
  "He doesn't have to do it unless he wants to be sure of being affirmed.",
  "Or some fact, not necessarily a particular fact.",
  "So long as the jury determines the facts that make them similar.",
  "The problem here is what makes them similar.",
  "Well, you're -- I mean, this is a self fulfilling prophecy. You're saying if you don't comply with the guidelines, you're not going to have uniformity. Well, I -- my goodness. Is that consistent with the notion that the guidelines are advisory?",
  "But that's just inconsistent with the notion which I think is correct, that the district judge can simply disagree with the basic -- basic reasons of the commission, can simply disagree with the fact that the commission considers white collar crime, for example, something that should justify incarceration.",
  "Is the system that you're describing any different for mandatory guidelines that are subject to departure when the district judge finds a significant reason, which was what mandatory guidelines had?",
  "Wherein is it different?",
  "Mr. Olson, before you get into the merits I have a question, a preliminary question. I understand from AT&T's brief that there has been a stipulation entered into between the parties after the judgment below which preserved Microsoft's right to appeal and prescribed different dollar amounts that Microsoft must pay AT&T depending on the outcome of the appeal. Does that raise any, any muteness problem? Can you sort of wager on the outcome of an appeal that way?",
  "Well, suppose two parties just, you know, parties that otherwise do not have a case or controversy, bet each other that the district court will come out one way or the other way in, in a trumped-up suit. Does that create a standing - -",
  "Well, you could say the same thing in the hypothetical I gave. It is a matter of wager, which way the Court will come out.",
  "Do you know of any, any precedent for that?",
  "That's so, but is there a lot of money involved depending on whether you win or lose?",
  "Okay.",
  "Or at least the correct way to understand component.",
  "You can't patent, you know, on-off, on-off code in the abstract, can you?",
  "There needs to be a device.",
  "Can I ask you, the point I don't understand when you say the -- the component is the disk that contains material, I understand that because here is a separate piece; it's a disk. You plug it in; it has the information on it. But then you say, if you put it on the hard drive it becomes the component. But the hard drive is not a separate thing like a disk. And when you say you put it on the hard drive you have nothing there but -- but -- but ons and offs. You have nothing there but the -- but the thought.",
  "How can you call, you know, what? Is it a separate section of the hard drive? No.",
  "That, that code is not patentable, you've said.",
  "I hope we can continue calling it the golden disk. It has a certain Scheherazade quality that really adds a lot of interest to this case.",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "In the law, we don't -- we certainly don't want to deprive any statutory provision of its whole purpose and effect. And as I understand the purpose of this especially short statute of limitations, it is to enable the Government to dispose of the property that it has seized, and to be able to give clear title to it without somebody coming back, you know, many years later and saying this property should not have been taken. How is that purpose served if indeed you can proceed under the provision that has a longer statute?",
  "What if the amount wasn't paid and what if your client just sat back and the, the assets, or let's say some real estate were, were seized by the Government. Would the 1346 action still lie? Or is it only for return of money that, that's been paid to satisfy the tax?",
  "And that's the, it seems to me the principal problem that the Government was facing and justified the short statute, wasn't it? That is the need to get, to be able to convey clear title to this property that it has seized. But once -- once the money is put up, and what the Government has taken is in effect payment of the tax, maybe there is no harm in proceeding under 1346.",
  "I'm helping you.",
  "Was, was the more specific statute there enacted after the more general statute?",
  "The reason I ask is we - - we do have a principle which I think is a sound one, that repeals by implication are not fatal. And what you're saying is that the enactment of the more narrow statute impliedly repeals the cause of action that existed under 1346. Do you know if any of your cases that you cite, even those outside of the Internal Revenue field, involve more specific statutes enacted after the general statute that they supposedly limit?",
  "Well, I guess - -",
  "Well, that's certainly true when the two are enacted at the same time, obviously. Or even when the, when the general is enacted after the more specific one and does not thereby limit the more specific one. But, well - -",
  "Pre-Williams you're talking about?",
  "Did you make that argument, did the Government make that argument, in Williams?",
  "Yes, that -- that Congress had enacted another statute which presumes that there is no cause of action under 1346?",
  "Yes, but even if it wasn't available to her, the fact that there was another statute the whole premise for which is the unavailability of a remedy under 1346, it seems to me that would have, that would have strengthened the Government's case in Williams.",
  "I forgot about that footnote.",
  "I don't know that I agree with that. I mean, if this fellow driving 90 miles an hour is responsible for endangering people, you're proposing a rule that says if there's a 50 percent chance that he'll hurt some innocent person and a 50 percent chance that he'll get hurt if you try to stop him, you shouldn't do anything. I don't agree with that.",
  "I'd stop him. I mean, he's the fellow that's causing the danger, endangerment, isn't he?",
  "I think you're giving away too much.",
  "Well, I suppose there is also a high probability where you're going 90 miles an hour on a one-way road, crossing over the double yellow line, with oncoming traffic, that you're going to hurt somebody else.",
  "I mean, the more you increase the speed the more likely he's going to be hurt. But also the more likely if you let him go somebody else is going to be hurt.",
  "Finish that.",
  "Excuse me. He reasonably -- because Scott reasonably believed that he could bump the car off the road at 90 miles an hour without risking the driver's life? Is that why it's like the Third Circuit case?",
  "Well, but the Third Circuit case you just described didn't talk about intent. It talked about reasonable belief.",
  "He created the scariest chase I ever saw since \"The French Connection.\"",
  "It is frightening.",
  "A frightening amount of speed, and cars coming in the opposite direction, at night, on a two-lane windy road - -",
  "But the issue in the case was quite simply whether there had been a seizure. Isn't that the issue?",
  "Not if he is shooting his way out of the house and endangering other people.",
  "I mean, that's a factor here, of course. If he has taken the jewelry and he's gone off into the night, if shooting at him might endanger somebody else, or even kill him, you have to let him go. I'm talking about a burglar who is, you know, who is shooting as he leaves.",
  "Of course you can shoot him.",
  "Is that a factual finding of the, of the trial court here?",
  "Are we bound by that fact?",
  "Even if having watched the tape, there is no way that, that factual finding can be accurate?",
  "Mr. Jones, could I - -",
  "Could I ask whether the portion of the opinion that you say establishes that he was not endangering anybody is this portion? The court is mindful that traffic laws are designed to -- safely -- and Harris acted in an unsafe manner. However, the record reflects\" -- - is this the portion?",
  "-- \"that he maintained control over his vehicle.\" Well, that doesn't prove he's not endangering anybody. \"Used his turn signals\" -- wonderful.",
  "\"And did not endanger any particular motorist on the road.\" I think that's true. In that scary chase he, he didn't come close to hitting any particular car, but I don't think that's, that's a finding that he was not endangering anybody. \"Any particular motorist,\" but he was endangering the public at large.",
  "It depends on how fast - - if depends on how fast the car is going, whether it's a two-lane road or four-lane divided highway. All those factors come into, into account. And it doesn't seem to me that we have to adopt a rule that will, that will discourage police officers. There's, there's enough disincentive to engage in this kind of activity in the fact that the police officer may hurt himself. It's pretty risky to conduct this kind of a maneuver, don't you think? I wouldn't have done it if I was Scott.",
  "I would have let the guy go.",
  "Driving 90 miles an hour and comes up, approaches that car, that car swerved. Scott could have been killed, couldn't he?",
  "So I don't think we need a whole lot of disincentive to stop police officers in engaging in frolicsome conduct.",
  "Did this study show what future fleeing speeders would do? I mean, I will accept that for, for the sake of argument that -- in fact, it's probably true. I would have guessed that, if the police stopped chasing, you don't go 90 miles an hour anymore. But did this study show what the effect of a rule that says stop chasing when he hits 85, what the effect of that rule would be on, on fleeing speeders or fleeing felons, or fleeing anybody?",
  "Whether he is endangering anybody is a historical fact, no? So what do you do about that finding?",
  "It is.",
  "I would hope he would wait until there were no pedestrians or vehicles coming before he, before he did the ramming.",
  "I assume he waited precisely for that kind of a gap in the traffic?",
  "What can the parents get out of this case other than reimbursement for the tuition they've paid to private schools and procedural rights that are given them by the Act? What can they get out of this case other than those two things that do not depend upon their status as representatives of the child?",
  "What other possible relief could they seek other than giving them a procedural right accorded by the Act? What other possible relief could they seek that they would not be seeking as guardians of the child?",
  "It depends upon their being a party aggrieved. That is defined in Black's Law Dictionary as a party entitled to a remedy.",
  "Now if the only remedies the parents are entitled to in their own right are reimbursement, which is at issue here, and procedural guarantees, why would not their ability to sue or to appear pro se be limited to those two categories? You'd win this case, but I'm talking about how broad is the rule that you're urging us to adopt?",
  "The child is. The child is entitled to an appropriate public education and the parents are entitled to have it provided free. That's really the only interest they have on the table, it seems to me, separate and apart from their status as representatives or guardians of the child.",
  "You know, it's not an insignificant matter at issue here. Counsel, who are referred to as officers of the court, protect the court from frivolous suits, from suits that really have no basis. When we give that authority to appear in court and initiate a suit to the public at large, we make a lot more work for Federal district judges. Why should we interpret this statute to achieve that unusual result?",
  "These disadvantaged parents that you are referring to who comprise the majority of parents, they're really up on section, you know, (h)(1) and all that stuff? I find that hard to believe. I mean, the people you're assertedly benefiting here are the people least likely to have familiarized themselves with the statute and the procedures.",
  "And do it right after reading pro se prisoner petitions, right? You'd have a nice evening's work.",
  "I think you quoted from 4(a).",
  "Well, then you still haven't said anything. I thought you were saying that they can sue for the money and they can sue for denied procedures. But if all the procedures are given and they're still not satisfied with the public education that is given, they would not be able to sue claiming that it was inadequate under the terms of the Act. You think they can sue then, too, as well.",
  "Well, you haven't said anything then.",
  "You really haven't limited the scope of the parent's right to sue at all.",
  "Fine. You've given the procedure but where does the Act guarantee the parents the proper outcome? The proper -- assignment?",
  "It does give the parents the right procedures explicitly and the rights to reimbursement for -- for private tuition.",
  "And that right, where - - where is that right contained? You have given us citations for the other ones. Where is that right contained?",
  "The right to initiate a suit solely on the basis -- not that I was denied procedures, not that I, I paid money for private schooling, but I do not believe the outcome, the education given to my child in the public school was enough.",
  "They have the right -- they have the right to the hearing. But do they have the right - -",
  "Do they have a right in and of themselves -- not as guardians -- do they have the right to a particular outcome in the hearing? That's, that's the point I'm inquiring to.",
  "What's that section you just alluded to? I'm blasting by it. Where is it, in the - -",
  "21 A or -- -",
  "And which is the statutory section again.",
  "I thought you said 14.",
  "Are you sure it's not 18(a)?",
  "It's in 18(a) of mine, too. Maybe I have a different brief there.",
  "What if -- what stands in the way of that analysis is the text, which says all other rights accorded to parents under this subchapter transfer to the child. Not only doesn't that help you, it seems to me it hurts you. It acknowledges that there are rights accorded to parents.",
  "But then you were denying them, as I understood the argument.",
  "What was the section you cited?",
  "(e)(3)(E).",
  "Legal fees. The disbursements under subparagraph (d) shall not support legal fees, court costs, or other costs associated with the cause of action brought on behalf of a child with a disability to ensure a free and appropriate public education for such child. What do you think that proves?",
  "If I understand your position correctly, if Congress enacts a program that favors religion over non-religion, which is supposedly what the establishment clause prohibits, that's bad; but if Congress enacts a perfectly valid general program and the President implements it in a fashion that favors religion over non-religion, that's okay, insofar as the ability of anybody to challenge it is concerned. Is that an accurate description?",
  "Why not?",
  "Okay.",
  "So you're saying if the Government, the executive, or the Congress, if the congressional statute authorizes the giving of money for the billing of a church, that's bad; but if it authorizes -- it makes a general authorization to the President -- no. If the congressional statute says the Government will build a church, that's okay, because then the money doesn't go outside the Government?",
  "Well, as far as standing is concerned.",
  "What is your answer to that? That in fact it's bad in the first situation and okay in the second, as far as standing is concerned?",
  "There is no standing for the internal Government church?",
  "No, we're not forcing anybody in at gunpoint. We're just building a Government church.",
  "But we're talking taxpayer standing. And you think there is a real difference insofar as whether the taxpayer is harmed between the Congress saying we're going to give the money to a religious organization to build a church and Congress saying we're going to build a church. You really think there's a difference?",
  "In both cases money is being used for a purpose that is contrary to the establishment clause, according to the taxpayer.",
  "I don't care whether it's the least of the concerns, it's a concern. It's the same establishment clause concern in both cases. Now you may well be correct that there's a freedom of religion clause violation in one case and not in the other, but as far as the establishment clause violation, I find it difficult to understand the difference between the two.",
  "But not -- but not if the President just gives the money out of a general appropriation, authorizing him to give money to people who are helping in the programs that the Faith-Based Initiative was -- was designed to help?",
  "If the President hands over the money, that's okay?",
  "Why, why not necessarily? I thought that was your -- you proposition, that it has to be a congressional violation not an executive.",
  "He's getting the money from Congress under a general, under a general appropriation. If he takes this money and he says here, use it for a religious purpose, that's okay?",
  "As far as standing is concerned, he can't be sued?",
  "Why didn't you say so?",
  "I -- I've been trying to make sense out of what you're saying.",
  "Or to, or to put it another way, to put Justice Ginsburg's point another way, every Executive action that involves the expenditure of congressionally authorized funds is an as-applied challenge to an expenditure statute. Because the only way the statute is applied is through executive action. And whenever the executive spends the funds improperly, you have an as-applied challenge to the congressional statute authorizing the funds, whether it's a general statute or a -- or a single shot statute.",
  "It's a - -",
  "That's the essence of an as-applied challenge. You say the statute's okay. It is just what is being done under this statute that is bad. You don't have to identify a bad statute. You're saying it is a perfectly good statute, but the President is -- is violating the Constitution in the way that he's applying it.",
  "Getting upset is a constitutionally adequate reason to bring a lawsuit? If people get upset about spending money for purposes that the Federal Government is not allowed to spend money for because of States' rights, that also would justify Article III standing, wouldn't it?",
  "Let me give you something more measurable. It is easy to tell from time sheets and other things how much money is expended on Air Force One and on security for the President when he goes to address a religious organization, okay. And he urges the importance of religion in American life and so forth. The whole trip is about religion. That's measurable. Would a taxpayer have standing to - -",
  "Well, I don't understand. The money -- say it again?",
  "You mean Congress has to, has to say that - -",
  "Well, what about Bowen? The money wasn't central to the violation there.",
  "It was, you know, a pregnancy program and the executive added to it certain, certain restrictions that were challenged as being religiously based.",
  "And we allowed an as-applied challenge.",
  "But this is a specific grant. There is money allocated to the White House which goes -- you can identify it in the budget, and some of it goes to Air Force One. Some of it goes to the payment of the security guards.",
  "It wasn't in Bowen either.",
  "I really don't think - - there's an identified sum of money that goes to pay the costs of Air Force One, too, to buy the gas and everything else. There's an identified sum of money that goes into the pockets of the security guards who protect the President. I mean, it really doesn't make any sense.",
  "Or the contract hiring the security guards who protect the President, right? They're employed. That's an employment contract.",
  "And they're protecting him for a religious purpose. He's going to this - -",
  "This is money that is expended in order to enable the President to do something for a religious purpose. It wouldn't be expended but for the fact that he chose to make this religious trip.",
  "It wasn't, it wasn't the center in Bowen either. The center in Bowen was programs for -- to combat pregnancy. And some of the organizations that were getting the money were placing conditions on it. It wasn't central to the program. It was something added that the challenger said shouldn't have been added.",
  "I see. It would only came within your theory if there was one Secret Service agent who was assigned to religious trips of the President? Then his entire salary could be challenged. But if it's just some of the salary of a Secret Service agent who protects the President for all sorts of trips, that can't be challenged?",
  "And that makes a lot of sense?",
  "But in response to Justice Ginsburg's point, you could have said the same thing about the expenditure in Bowen. That money would have been spent anyway.",
  "It happened to have been spent badly, but it would have been spent anyway.",
  "That was her point, that it would have been spent differently. If the President hadn't gone to this religious event, he would have gone somewhere else and the money would have been spent differently. But that didn't make the difference in Bowen. Why should it make the difference here?",
  "The fact is it was spent for a bad purpose, and that's the essential grievance of the plaintiff, it seems to me.",
  "You really want to condemn the Federal courts to deciding case by case at the instance of all these people who feel passionately about this, case by case whether the expenditure was incidental or not. It doesn't seem to me an intelligent expenditure of any sensible person's time.",
  "What about 10?",
  "I was about to ask, 20.",
  "We'll litigate it. We'll figure out a number eventually, I'm sure.",
  "But the problem here is the claim, the gravamen here is the Government is doing stuff with money that's been taxed from me that it shouldn't do. I fail to see how it makes any difference to the people who care so passionately about this, as Justice Breyer suggests, whether it's just an incidental expenditure or whether it's part of a targeted program. We don't do that in any other area of constitutional law. If someone has been subjected to an unreasonable search and seizure, we don't say well, you know, it was just incidental. Yeah, we know you feel badly about it, but this was just an incidental search and seizure, and you don't have standing. It doesn't make any sense, given the gravamen that you're directing this law against, to establish such a standard.",
  "And you also acknowledge we're not here to try to make sense.",
  "So there's no standing to challenge a presidential directive which says we are going to buy bagels for all evangelistic Christian breakfasts.",
  "Okay? But not for any - -",
  "Why would there be standing?",
  "How does that confer standing? How does that confer standing?",
  "Right. Right.",
  "Standing by Joe Doaks, not from somebody who's starting a Jewish prayer breakfast and says, you know, what could be worse than not buying bagels for a Jewish prayer breakfast. With him I could understand, he has standing. But I'm just talking about one of these many people who feel passionately about this just in general. You walk in and say he can't do this because I'm a taxpayer, and you say I'm sorry, being a taxpayer is not enough, we don't care how passionately you feel about it - -",
  "Well, it's not the same money used. It's not the same property.",
  "It goes into some pot of fungible money and it's other money used. So instead of using other money, you use land. Does that make a difference?",
  "Mr. Garre, could you crank up the thing? The sound isn't working, I don't think, Mr. Garre.",
  "They may be wrong, too. They may have been as much a part of the conspiracy as the officers who conducted it. And there are indeed those in the West who think that the BLM does, does act quite arbitrarily and high-handedly and is, is upheld by, by the, the administrative courts. Now, if that's a problem, what's the solution to that problem?",
  "That's one by one. Every time there is another trespass he has to go all the way through the administrative procedure and then when the, when the administrative court says, well, it was okay, then he has to go through the regular Federal courts. That doesn't seem to me like a realistic remedy, not for somebody who claims he's being systematically harassed for five years as, as is the claim here.",
  "I don't assume that at all. Even if they, even if they succeed, they say, yes, you're right, they trespassed, good for you. I mean, what is the remedy if they did trespass? What administrative remedy does he obtain.",
  "What -- the photographing of his guests who he brings onto his ranch to hunt and they pay him for that. And then he claims that the BLM follows them just to harass them, just taking photographs. What relief could he get for that?",
  "Let's assume they wasn't trespassing.",
  "What damages would you get for the trespass of a -- one, one BLM agent on your land? A lot of money you're going to get for that? Would it, would it come anywhere close to reimbursing you for the lawyers' fees that it's taken to go, to go all the way through the litigation?",
  "He doesn't say it deprived him of his property which is his business.",
  "He is saying it's a trespass; get off my land.",
  "Part of his claim is -- is selective enforcement. You know, maybe he did trespass, maybe some of his cattle did stray on somebody's land. But they are beating on him because of what they say is his failure to give a reciprocal easement which the Government is entitled to. To what extent was any of the administrative approval of the BLM agents' actions, to what extent was that based on the legitimacy of seeking to extract this reciprocal easement from him? Because I don't see that it's legitimate at all.",
  "Was that because the Government was entitled to the reciprocal easement? Is that why they said that?",
  "It wasn't extortion because he should have given the easement.",
  "Not after, not after they have already given away -- I mean, yes; they could come to him anew and say I'll tell you what, if you give us this easement we'll give you yet another one.",
  "But he had one in, from the past, which -- which his predecessor had given a reciprocal easement for, and the Government failed to record the easement and therefore was is deprived of it.",
  "And they're mad at him for not giving back that easement which they failed to record.",
  "It wouldn't be reciprocal. What was the Government offering to give him in exchange for his, his reaffirming the prior easement that they had failed to record? What was the Government giving him in exchange?",
  "He had that already.",
  "I did not -- I did not understand that.",
  "If a -- including, you know, busting into his lodge and disrupting the furniture and all of that, they thought that that was probably - -",
  "-- probably allowed?",
  "Is that a test for -- for -- for qualified immunity? You have to know -- not only - -",
  "It's not enough to know that your action was wrongful? You have to know the particular statute or constitutional provision under which a remedy would be sought?",
  "Mr. Tribe, can I get something straight? Is it indeed correct that what the government was seeking here was an exchange of easements, that the government was going to give one and your client would give the other?",
  "With the predecessor in interest of your client.",
  "Did what the government gave to your predecessor of interest, did that easement continue? The government has just said that it expired.",
  "That's how I understood it.",
  "I don't care whether it was canceled, but I must say, if they were just seeking a fair exchange of reciprocal easements, which landowners do all the time - -",
  "And the system of lands out there can't work without it.",
  "I wouldn't see anything terribly wrong about the BLM people say okay, he wants to play hardball, he wants to play by the book, we'll play by the book. What would be wrong with - -",
  "See, I wouldn't feel bad about that if they said - -",
  "-- by God, every time his cows trespass, we're going to get him. Every time his hunting expeditions go on public land, we're going to get him. That would seem reasonable to me. So it really is crucial to my view of the case that the government was not seeking a new exchange, it was seeking - -",
  "-- for him to cough up - -",
  "And then if you would have succeeded, you would have been compensated.",
  "Mr. Tribe, I'll tell what you troubles me about this case. There are overzealous government agents. There always have been and I am sure that, assuming all of the misbehavior described here is correct, I'm sure it is not the first time this has happened. Government agents sometimes get overzealous. But why should there be this extraordinary remedy when the overzealousness happens to be attached to a desire to get a piece of land, whereas if they had just picked on this guy because they didn't like the way he combed his hair or for any other reason and had done the same things you wouldn't have your Bivens action, right?",
  "No, no. If they were trying to get some other property for it or, or, or money for it, it didn't turn - -",
  "The whole spectrum of possible Government misbehavior, selective enforcement, the whole spectrum, the only, the only times we're going to allow a cause of action under Bivens or under, under not 1983 -- yes -- the only times we're going to do that is when there is a demand for property?",
  "They might have been lying about that - -",
  "-- just as they lied about a lot of other stuff, according to - -",
  "Why wouldn't there be an assignment? Why, why would the prior owner have any - - any interest in not assigning it?",
  "So you want to get away from a hypothetical then. I don't know why you try to defend a hypothetical that involves a banner that says amend the marijuana laws. That's not this case as you see it, is it?",
  "This banner was interpreted as meaning smoke pot, no?",
  "Why do we have to get into the question of what the school board's policy is and what things they can make its policy? Surely it can be the -- it must be the policy of any school to discourage breaking of the law. I mean, suppose this banner had said kill somebody, and there was no explicit regulation of the school that said you should not, you should not foster murder. Wouldn't that be suppressible?",
  "Of course it would, so - -",
  "Why can't we decide this case on that narrow enough ground, that any school whether it has expressed the policy or not, can suppress speech that advocates violation of the law?",
  "Does it have - -",
  "Mr. Starr, you -- you responded to Justice Breyer that you think the school could just prohibit the unfurling of 15 foot banners on a trip. Could it prohibit the wearing of black armbands on a trip?",
  "And if not -- if not, what's the difference?",
  "Were they required to go to this event and could they have skipped off and gone home without violating - -",
  "They were required to attend.",
  "Well, but the school has - - the school has a program, an anti -drug program that shows movies, it brings in policemen and social workers to preach against drug use and you're saying that - - never mind unfurling a banner. You're saying that it has to let students contradict this message it's trying to teach, to walk around, you know, with a button that says \"Smoke Pot, It's Fun.\"",
  "Does the school have to do that?",
  "But the school, even though it is trying to teach one point of view, can allow students to come in and undermine that point of view, assuming that it's legitimate to teach that point of view? It can allow students to come in and undermine what it's trying to teach?",
  "And that is not disruption in your view?",
  "Nonviolent crimes are okay, it's only violent crimes that you can't, you can not promote, right? Right?",
  "\"Extortion Is Profitable,\" that's okay?",
  "This is a very, very, with all respect, ridiculous line. I mean, I can understand you're saying you cannot promote things that are unlawful, but to say, oh, it's only violent, where do you get that line from, only violent unlawful acts?",
  "Well, you can say that, but the subsequent cases seem to me to try to cut back on it. I mean, it stood the test of time in the sense that it hasn't been overruled, but - -",
  "I think we're using disruption in two different senses here and we should probably separate the two. One sense is disrupting the class so that whatever is being taught can't be taught. But you're also using it in the sense of undermining a general message that the school is trying to get across: Obey the law, don't use drugs, whatever. Maybe we should have a different word for -- the first is disruption. Disruption is a, is a funny word for the second. Let's called it undermining instead. Now, you think both of them, however, are bad and both of them can be a basis for suppressing the speech?",
  "So you think undermining is perfectly okay? You would never consider undermining to be disruption and therefore bad?",
  "Okay, but only that.",
  "Right after a class on drugs, he can be standing there in the hall and say: This class was ridiculous, drugs are good for you, I use them all the time, I urge all of you. That's perfectly okay? That's not undermining?",
  "That's not disruption?",
  "A school isn't an open forum. A school isn't there for everybody to teach the students whatever he wants. It's there for the teachers to instruct. And you're turning it into an open forum. If the school says, addresses one issue, everybody else has to be able to address that issue.",
  "That's not my vision of what a school is.",
  "I had to watch -- not even watch the parade, no requirement they watch the parade? They were released in order to watch the parade.",
  "The intent, it was the direction.",
  "It was not only the intent, it was the direction.",
  "Go ahead.",
  "As it is to us, right?",
  "He wasn't playing hooky. He showed up late, that's all, right? I mean, he actually came and joined his classmates at an event that he knew was an event that the school told the classes to go to.",
  "As far as I'm concerned, he just showed up late.",
  "Because you're both a truant and disrupter, you get off.",
  "Had you been just a disrupter, tough luck.",
  "Who were the people that helped him hold up his flag? Were they not classmates of his?",
  "Did he not know that these classmates were there at a public event that was sponsored, not sponsored, but to which the school had directed the students to go?",
  "So it seems to me it's like joining a school trip at the zoo, you know. You -- you don't make it to the -- to the school, but you drive there yourself and then join the class as it's going through the zoo. It seems to me he's in school.",
  "You think he could have been marked absent for the whole day because he didn't intend to be part of the school group afterwards? I mean, suppose there's a suspension of so much for half a day truancy, and so much more for a whole day's truancy. And he shows up and he says, oh, you can't -- you have to hold me for a whole day's truancy because I didn't intend to be in school. I was in school but I didn't intend to be there.",
  "That doesn't make any sense to me. Does it depend on his intent, whether or not he intended to be a truant that afternoon?",
  "He was either in school or he wasn't in school.",
  "In the afternoon he either was or he wasn't.",
  "And the question is whether joining the school group, intentionally joining the school group, going there because the school group was there, whether that places him in school.",
  "I thought you were going to appeal to the calm of her office the next day. I thought that was going to be your answer to my question. Whatever she thought at the time, she didn't think it later.",
  "Well, if we're talking about what -- where is the logic in the result that I believe you're position produces, which is that a prisoner who loses in the State court on harmlessness grounds, because the State court finds it's harmless, obtains no habeas relief in Federal court unless the error actually prejudiced him. Whereas if the State court never reached the harmlessness ground, and erred on -- or ruled on whether the violation occurred, whether there was any constitutional violation, then he would obtain relief if there is merely a reasonable probability of harm. Now, you know, why would there -- what does he care whether -- whether the error below consisted in an erroneous harmlessness determination or an erroneous determination that there was no violation? Why should there be a different standard of review between the two?",
  "Let's assume another violation, the court erroneously determines - - erroneously -- that there was no constitutional violation at all. Its error is not with regard to the harmlessness, but with regard to whether there was a constitutional violation. Why should there be one standard of review for one error and a different standard of review for the other, regardless of whether the State court conducted Chapman or not?",
  "You could say the same thing when the State court has erroneously determined that there was no violation. In that case, you apply the Kotteakos standard. I just don't understand the rationale of applying a higher standard to the other error.",
  "And it is that determination that you are objecting to here. The harmlessness determination.",
  "But for the former, you are perfectly content with our applying Kotteakos. And for the latter, however, you say we have to apply Chapman. I just don't see the logic of that.",
  "The dissenters certainly thought that that was the consequence, the dissenters in Brecht. They said that Kotteakos would apply even where the State court has found that \"no violation has occurred.\"",
  "In other words, never approached the harmlessness thing. That's what the dissenters thought.",
  "The trouble with reading that second question that way is that, you know, it follows from your first question, which speaks in the generality of cases. It's not speaking to this case. Your first question presented is, if constitutional error in a State trial is not recognized by the judiciary until the case ends up in Federal court, is the prejudicial impact assessed under the standard set forth in Chapman or in Brecht? That's the first question. Very generalized. Second question: Does it matter which harmless-error standard is employed? I didn't take that to mean does it matter in this case which of the two. I thought it meant, you know, is there any difference between the two standards? Don't you think that's fair reading of it.",
  "You think it means, does it matter in this case which harmless -- you think that second sentence means would, would the defendant be entitled to reversal of the conviction no matter which harmless error standard is employed? You think that's what it means?",
  "I suppose you could say that of all the questions that go into habeas under 2254, that they could have brought up directly but the chances are their being taken here are negligible?",
  "Wait. Why is it improper for, for the prosecution to argue that, given the facts of this case, given the aggravating factors and the lack of mitigating factors, the brutality of the crime, the only sensible decision for you ladies and gentlemen of the jury is the death penalty? That's an improper argument? Doesn't that amount to saying you have a duty to come back with the death penalty? Why can't the prosecution argue that?",
  "I don't understand your concession. Surely, the prosecutor was not telling this jury that in all capital cases you have to come in with a death verdict. Surely, although he didn't explicitly mention the evidence, the underlying premise of his argument was sometimes when you have a case this bad, you have to do your duty. Nobody likes to kill, but just as soldiers sometimes have to do that if that's their duty, so also jurors, if you really believe that the evidence is so one-sided in favor of the penalty that the State is asking for, it's your duty to bring the death verdict. I don't see anything wrong with that.",
  "Who said he was not supposed to do these things?",
  "And is that the law here?",
  "It says that in the text, doesn't it, \"clearly established by the Supreme Court\"? Is that not in the text of the statute?",
  "Certainly didn't say it in the brief in opposition. And we might not well have taken the case had that point been raised in the BIL.",
  "You have a much more limited point, as I understand it. Your more limited point is simply that this is not clearly established law pronounced by the Supreme Court.",
  "In this area of constitutional violation.",
  "You can't have it both ways, counsel. I mean, you're really losing me here. Either it is our supervisory power and therefore the States don't have to follow it, or it is more than our supervisory power and the States do have to follow it. I don't know that there's any way to straddle that.",
  "And a curative instruction given.",
  "What do you mean, how do you it failed to consider? I mean, is there an obligation to respond to every single point that's made?",
  "Did they refuse to accept argument on those points?",
  "If they did consider it, you mean they did not respond to that argument in their opinion.",
  "You don't know for sure that they didn't consider it. I mean, it may be argument to them. How could they not have considered it? They must have not considered it important, but that's a different - -",
  "As I recall, he didn't just say it is bigger than Weaver. He went on to discuss, you know, the drug gangs. And he says, they're not going to be affected by the threat of going to prison. They will be affected by the threat of dying. It seemed to me he tied it very, very closely into deterrence. And if you say that deterrence is okay for him to refer to, I don't know how there's anything left to your argument about his saying it's bigger than Weaver.",
  "Where? Where? Where? Where? Where does it say that? Where does it say never mind the facts? Let's, let's give this guy the death penalty as a Napoleon said, \"Por encourage les autres.\" You know, he said it didn't matter which, whether the general was guilty of, of cowardice or not; it would help to encourage the others to execute him. Where is there anything like that argument here? I don't see it.",
  "If you let a person who is as guilty as William Weaver go, you're affecting not just William Weaver, you're affecting the whole war on drugs, you're affecting the -- what's wrong with that? I -- I fail to see any indication here that he's telling the jury never mind the facts. Never mind how -- you know -- how horrible you think the crime was. Never mind all of the instructions that the judge gives you about aggravating factors and mitigating factors. Forget all of that. Kill William Weaver because it's bigger than him. I -- I just don't -- I just don't see the argument.",
  "Even -- even the Supreme Court cases going to the other points, they didn't - - did any of them involve a separate penalty phase? They were all just in the guilt, guilt phase of a non-capital case, weren't they?",
  "So that, so that when the prosecutor was urging particular action, he was urging the jury to find a person guilty. He was not just urging them what penalty is better or worse. He was saying for these reasons you should find the individual guilty. That's quite different it seems to me from the situation in which guilt has already been established. The trial's done. This person is guilty, and the only thing they're arguing about is what the penalty ought to be. I'm not sure that you can analogize, you know, from the one situation to the other in determining what kind of argument is proper. Because in the former situation when the -- if the prosecutor says this is not just about this defendant, it's about the whole society, he's urging the jury to find the person guilty. I mean -- and that's crazy. You don't find the person guilty in order to stop drug trafficking. But you do impose a heavier penalty in order to do that. So I just don't, don't see the analogy from the Supreme Court cases you have.",
  "That's different. Look - - it could -- could -- would defense counsel be able to argue during the guilt phase of the trial, in an ordinary trial where there's no separate phase, \"ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this person has a large family that's dependent on him; he's a miserable wretch. You shouldn't find him guilt. Is there no mercy in your heart?\" Would he be allowed to argue that? Of course not. Can he argue it in a guilt phase? Of course he can. And it seems to me in determining what arguments the prosecution can make you have to be guided by what arguments the defense can make. The defense can surely come in and say ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you're being called upon to kill somebody. Do you realize what a -- what a difficult, overwhelming thing that is? And then you say the prosecution can't come in and say ladies and gentlemen, sometimes if you do your duty, you have to kill. This is the law here. If you find the facts this way, that's your duty. I -- I -- I think you're, you're taking hard cases very much out of context by applying cases that relate to the guilt phase, to a very special procedure that we've set up in capital cases which is called the guilt -- uh, the penalty phase.",
  "The question has been switched here, Counsel. The question before us is not whether it was wrong, even if you answer there's plenty of Supreme Court precedent, even though none on these particular facts, to convince me that he shouldn't have said it. That's not the question before us. The question before us is whether it violates fundamental unfairness, whether it's wrong to such an extent that it invalidates the whole prosecution and -- and sentence. That's quite a different question. I can acknowledge, yeah, the prosecutor, you know, shouldn't do it. But that doesn't lead me to the, automatically to the conclusion that the Supreme Court jurisprudence shows that this so violates fundamental unfairness that the, that the verdict has to be set aside.",
  "Well, serve him right? I mean, is that - -",
  "How do you answer the argument, fight for life, always fight for life? How do you answer that argument, except by saying: Ladies and gentlemen, sometimes, sometimes it's your duty to vote for death? How else would you answer that argument?",
  "And was that this habeas? Then he filed a subsequent habeas or what?",
  "If -- if, if indeed that's, that's what he's aiming at, low price. Is it the object of the -- is the sole object of the Sherman Act to produce low prices?",
  "I thought it was consumer welfare.",
  "And I thought some consumers would prefer more service at a higher price.",
  "So the mere fact that it would increase prices doesn't prove anything. It doesn't prove that it's serving consumer welfare. If, in fact, it's giving the consumer a choice of more service at a somewhat higher price, that would enhance consumer welfare, so long as there are competitive products at a lower price, wouldn't it?",
  "So I don't know why, why we should have to focus our entire attention on whether it's going to -- going to produce higher prices or not. The market out there has different goods at different prices which have different qualities that attract different consumers.",
  "Is that right? I mean, You really think that antitrust policy means when -- any arrangement that produce a higher price is bad?",
  "I mean, a lot of consumers want, you know, extended warranties. They want show rooms where they can go and look at things. All of which costs more money. And where you can not have resale price maintenance the customers -- or you have the free rider problem. The customers shop at the place that has the big show room, likes at all the product there, and goes and buys it from somebody else who has not incurred that expense. Now, I just don't think that all the customers want is cheap. I think they want other things besides cheap. I think they want service. I think they want selection. I think they want the ability to view goods and so forth. Why do you discount all of those things?",
  "Well, they aren't available. This company thought that it could provide higher service if it could assure its retailers that they would not be undercut by people who are not providing that kind of service.",
  "I don't, I don't know that there's no question about that. There's certainly no question that this company was successful in breaking into a difficult market with its strategy of assuring its retailers a cushion so that they could provide the service.",
  "I don't understand that. I mean, if it was really the case that they were going to be losing, losing profits, I think they would have been here. I mean, we talk about the Wal-Marts and the Targets. They're not here on amicus briefs because they're -- what they're selling is cheap. They are selling price, and people who want low price and for whom that's of value above all other things are going to continue to go to those stores. So they're not going to be harmed by the fact that some manufacturers want to provide not just the low price -- of course, they'll try to keep the price as low as possible -- but service. I just don't see what, what harm can possibly come, so long as there's no market dominance, from allowing some people to make their money on service and -- rather than cheap price.",
  "No, but it's a totally -- I cannot imagine why a horizontal conspiracy among dealers could ever produce consumer welfare. It will be a horizontal conspiracy to get more money out of the consumer; but whereas the manufacturer who wants to impose resale price maintenance, his interest isn't to give the retailer as much -- more money than the retailer is now making. He's going to try to keep their margin just as low as it ever was, so that he can sell as many of his products as possible consistent with his desire to sell his product by attaching to it more service, better warranty, more showrooms, whatever. You know, horizontal conspiracy, the incentives are entirely different. When you're dealing with a manufacturer, it seems to me his incentive is still to keep the price as low as possible consistent with the additional good that he wants to give consumers to attract those consumers to his product.",
  "Well, if that's the case and if that makes a difference, the rule of reason would allow you to make that argument. But you -- but you want to say it's bad across the board for everybody. If indeed there's something peculiar about this case, the rule of reason would allow you to argue that.",
  "I don't suppose there's any -- I don't suppose there's any way to protect against the fallout to the consumer, is there? I mean if indeed, if indeed a store presses on a consumer a product that's more expensive than what he needs or - - and what he wants, is this a real argument against this, that there's some stupid consumers whose can be conned? I mean, whatever rule we adopt, that's going to be the situation.",
  "You're assuming that the - - that the retailer has a higher margin on the resale price good. Why do you assume that?",
  "He's only going to be given the thing if he does the kind of additional service that the manufacturer wants. That's the whole purpose of it. And the manufacturer is going to try to keep his margin just as low as he can consistent with the -- you know - - consistent with selling as many products as he can.",
  "I'm not sure it's often the case. Give me some other examples where you can achieve the same industry-wide effect unilaterally.",
  "Were they relying on Dr. Miles or were they relying on us? That's the question.",
  "They left the situation where it was, which is that the antitrust law is as determined by this Court, and we had shown our willingness to update the antitrust law when sound economic doctrine suggests is necessary.",
  "But some manufacturers want their product associated with excellent service, high warranty, and all of that. And there is no way to get that uniformly for that product without this kind of agreement.",
  "I guess Congress changed its mind then.",
  "I find it hard to believe that.",
  "Mr. Mancino, your position here is that this rule is not jurisdictional. Now, what -- what are the consequences of that? I take it that that would mean that the court of appeals has no obligation to inquire on its own whether the matter has been filed too late?",
  "Right? If the parties don't make anything of it, the court of appeals can - - can take a late, a late filing?",
  "No, no, but I'm asking whether a court of appeals has to even worry about that? If the parties don't make anything of it, the court of appeals can just assume it's okay and go ahead, right?",
  "And you need an objection or else it's, it will be okay?",
  "And you need an objection or else it will be all right?",
  "Suppose you have problems at home. I don't know, you have an illness at home. And you ask counsel for the other side, you know, I know it's a 14-day limit, but would you give me 20 days? Right? And opposing counsel being as friendly as they are nowadays - - (Some laughter.)",
  "-- the other, the other side would say sure, take 20 days. Okay? So you prepare a paper for signature by the judge and he signs off on it, gives you 20 days. That's okay then, right?",
  "Because the other side's agreed. He won't object on the court of appeals. And suddenly, suddenly, you've got 20 days even though the rule says 14.",
  "You know sometimes, sometimes district courts take jurisdiction over a case that they -- that they shouldn't have jurisdiction over.",
  "And sometimes in reliance on that, you go through a whole trial and it comes up to the court of appeals and we say huh, there was no jurisdiction here; too bad.",
  "Even though the court said it and you went through a whole trial in reliance on the district judge. District judges make mistakes.",
  "It's even worse, it seems to me. I mean, you've wasted weeks, you know, in trial and so forth.",
  "But if it's jurisdictional, we have to say, you know, too bad. Yes, you were misled by the judge. In reliance on the district judge, you expended a lot of time and money, but there was no jurisdiction. And that's the end of the matter.",
  "Maybe Arabic numerals aren't jurisdictional either.",
  "What characteristics are you asserting follow from calling it jurisdictional in this case?",
  "Number one, it can't be waived, right?",
  "Number two - -",
  "The court of appeals has to inquire on its own, right?",
  "Anything else?",
  "Except at least as to the second, at least as to the second, I don't know of any matter that a court has to inquire into sua sponte which is not jurisdictional. That's the one of the three characteristics that I think we have always attached the word \"jurisdictional\" to, I think.",
  "It may.",
  "But not must.",
  "Not must. And truly with things we have called jurisdictional, you must, right?",
  "We could call it \"quasi-jurisdictional.\" You wouldn't object to that?",
  "Well, what do you think is the - -",
  "Did it, did it specifically state that, or is it that or just the principle that all Federal agencies have an obligation to - -",
  "I don't even think we mentioned them. Did we mention them?",
  "Did we mention them in those cases?",
  "Well, maybe we just forgot.",
  "I suppose if primary jurisdiction were a cure-all, there would never be any cases in which the regulatory scheme did not displace the antitrust laws.",
  "The EPA is not a hands-on regulatory agency the way the SEC is. It has not been given an entire industry to regulate.",
  "Well, the Government says that's fine where the regulations have been issued, and where they -- where they render the action here lawful. There's no -- no problemo. What's wrong with that?",
  "The Government's willing, in other words, to give the SEC carte blanche. Whatever you say is lawful is lawful that won't violate the antitrust laws.",
  "Extends a lot further, I would think.",
  "So we could decide that way. We could say, we don't have to decide what the standard is, even if it is inextricably intertwined as the Government does, you would win, you would be happy - -",
  "But the problem you address has been a problem of strike suits. And it is the problem that Congress addressed in its legislation. Shake downs. It just is less expensive to pay off the suitor than it is to litigate it to a final conclusion, where that conclusion is highly uncertain. And I don't see how your -- your solution of inextricably intertwined, where there's a penalty of treble damages if you guess wrong about that line, I don't see how that's going to stop the strike suits any more than the current situation does.",
  "I wouldn't want to roll the dice on whether something is inextricably intertwined, with treble damages at the end.",
  "He's not saying that that's this case. He's just saying that it's so easy to make allegations that action which was perfectly legitimate amounted to action that was illegitimate. And that question ultimately gets thrown into the laps of the jury; and if the jury comes out the wrong way, you get hit with treble damages.",
  "I'm done.",
  "Why is that? I don't understand why the SEC could not -- they can make rules for a single IPO; it seems to me they can make rules for coordination of IPO. Why can't they do that?",
  "Right, right.",
  "They have chosen not to.",
  "No, but - -",
  "But you -- you could regard the activity of laddering and of making a book on a stock when the -- in the case of a single offering. You could -- you could look upon that as, as an attempt to raise the price. That's what it is, isn't it? An attempt to make sure there's going to be a high enough price for the stock so that it won't flop once it's out there?",
  "Yeah. And you're saying they did this just -- not in the context of just single IPOs, but that they agreed across IPOs that they would all do this.",
  "Why?",
  "Uh-huh. The customer being the issuer?",
  "They'd have to pay the premium.",
  "Look, the question isn't whether it satisfies it. The question is whether you can get rid of this suit at the outset or do you have to go through enormously expensive discovery, which - - which isn't worth the candle.",
  "-- discovery? Right?",
  "I don't think you've answered his question.",
  "I think that you've said that the two were different. His question was how can you tell at the outset, at the 12(b)(6) stage, the difference between those two things that you've mentioned? Sure they're different but -- but the evidence that is only evidence of the one also looks like evidence of the other.",
  "But that wasn't the SEC's position below, was it?",
  "And the Justice Department was on one side, the SEC was on the other. Right?",
  "It looks to me like they split the baby up here.",
  "I don't understand what happens with this primary jurisdiction in the context of an antitrust suit. You're entitled to a jury trial in the antitrust suit, right?",
  "And in primary jurisdiction, would we refer it to the SEC and accept the SEC's fact determinations and then instruct the jury that - -",
  "And it is really the factual determination that is the hang-up, that you don't want things that are innocent and that the SEC would know are innocent to be taken as evidence of guilty by the jury. So you really haven't accomplished a whole lot if you just send it over to the SEC for rulings on the law as opposed to rulings on whether this particular conduct violated the law.",
  "What's your test, Mr. Shapiro?",
  "In a criminal case, the person seeking that action is a government officer who presumptively is not acting out of selfish motives, whereas we're talking about private suits and some private litigants are selfish.",
  "Yeah. Well, I don't think Congress was trying to achieve an alteration in the ultimate standard, either, in the jury standard. What it was concerned with is the enormous expense of -- of discovery. And, and tried to set a high wall to get to the discovery stage. I don't know why that should have to affect or should logically affect the standard that the jury is told to use.",
  "How about just saying that he knew it?",
  "Just saying that he knew it. Without saying why they knew that he knew it? You're saying they have to give a reason why they knew that he knew it, namely he routinely read these reports? Suppose they didn't say that. They just said knowing that the -- that the figures were otherwise, he -- he set them forth.",
  "Mr. Shanmugam, could - - could I get you back to -- to your, your assertion of we don't have to reach in this case the question of whether the same standard applies at trial as, as at the pleading stage? It seems to me a Seventh Amendment claim has been raised. It's our usual policy to avoid unnecessary constitutional adjudication. If indeed the two standards are the same, there's certainly no Seventh Amendment problem. So why don't we have to first of all decide, in resolving the Seventh Amendment claim, whether the two standards are the same?",
  "But you're getting to the merits of the constitutional problem. And we usually run away from constitutional problems. We don't even want to consider the merits of it. And we don't have to, if indeed the two standards are the same.",
  "Well, but Congress just established an entry qualification for getting into court. And there are a lot of entry qualifications. In diversity cases, you -- if you allege diversity, and it existed at the outset, that's fine. That doesn't have to be proved at the end of the case. Indeed even if you prove the contrary, the case is still validly there. Congress can establish entry requirements even when they differ from, or have indeed nothing to do with the merits that the jury is supposed to decide.",
  "Right. And then on appeal, we would say, no, it's not a strong inference, or yes, it is a strong inference. I mean, I hope we're going to establish some standards for how you go about determining whether there's a strong inference or not.",
  "I think it's 66 and two-thirds. I think that is - -",
  "What about clear and convincing? Is it below clear -- I mean, they are the only two standards I actually understand. Without picking a number out of air, is preponderance, I think I can figure that out. And I guess I can figure out beyond a reasonable doubt. But other than those, when you talking about strong, when you talk about clear and convincing, I have no idea what those things mean. Do you?",
  "You don't think they mean anything?",
  "Let me write that down. We should not take you literally. All right.",
  "Mr. Miller, suppose Congress set up a entirely separate cause of action. It's caused -- it's called a discovery cause of action, okay? And it sets forth as the condition for pursuing that cause of action a standard that your, your allegation has to be indeed clear and convincing. Okay? And then if you win that, you can take whatever you get out of the discovery and bring a lawsuit. Would that be unconstitutional?",
  "Removal. Removal was -",
  "You said remand was proper. That's the - -",
  "But we go into that question all the time, 1447(b) is a nullity. I mean, if in every case you're going to be able to appeal whether indeed there was lack of jurisdiction, you're going to be able to appeal every case.",
  "That would be fine if 1447(d) said that there is no appeal so long as the basis for removal was proper, but that's not what it says.",
  "Well, you're into your backup argument now.",
  "The backup argument that you're now making, that not your principal argument.",
  "They don't care whether it had subject matter jurisdiction or not. It's not an essential part of their case. Their case is even if it did, it mistakenly thought it didn't, and remand it, end of case.",
  "That's their backup argument, I think.",
  "It's -- it's the same with diversity jurisdiction. You can make the same argument. There's nothing distinctive here. This statute says that in a foreign sovereign immunity case you have a right to be tried in Federal court. Fine. But the statute also says that if you're a defendant in a diversity suit, you have a right to trial in federal court. And I don't know why this is any more demanding of an exception to 1447(d) than is ordinary diversity jurisdiction, where Congress has said you're entitled to trial in federal court.",
  "How is that relevant here? Where is the post-removal event?",
  "Well, that's not an event. That's -- that's an epiphany, it's not an event.",
  "Very strange meaning of event.",
  "I mean the sovereign immunity didn't exist from the outset. Nothing changed.",
  "When did it say that? I really find it very hard to accept that argument, when its says -- you know -- it doesn't use lacks removal jurisdiction, that's what it means. It is such an easy thing to say.",
  "Can I, -- I'm not sure it is even that he made a mistake. It is even worse than that. If he gets it right and finds that you are a sovereign - -",
  "-- you can go back to State court. I mean, that's even worse. He gets it right.",
  "But his clever opponent would say - -",
  "-- that what 1447(d) means is that you can be tried in State courts. That's precisely what it says.",
  "I recommend that.",
  "What's a footman? I don't even know what a footman is.",
  "What is a footman?",
  "Mr. Farr, I'm not sure I followed your argument with regard to 552,101(a).",
  "Page 77a as you said. But what is your argument there? I mean, that seems to, that seems to reinforce the provision that you say we should ignore or at least should accept the Secretary's reinterpretation of.",
  "That's right.",
  "Yeah. I see. Is that clear in the -- in the specific Senate report that is referred to here?",
  "This, the one that's cited in the regulation itself. Because I -- otherwise, I don't, I ignore those things. That's cited in the regulation. Does that report say it?",
  "Well, wait. Does the notice of proposed rulemaking set forth the agency's position?",
  "I didn't think it did. They're just floating an idea. You know - -",
  "Run it up the flagpole, see if - -",
  "It wouldn't take a whole lot of imagination for Justice Breyer to give the money to his mother, who could then hire.",
  "I mean, a clever lawyer would think of that, I think.",
  "And perhaps there are people, lawyers in the Government, who try to see through that kind of thing.",
  "Well, it could have said a lot of things. But I find it -- you're hanging your case upon the proposition that there is a difference between domestic service employment and employed in domestic service employment. Wow. You know, I just don't see how there's any difference in those two at all.",
  "You're saying we have to find some difference no matter how imaginative the difference might be. If there were a difference, I'm not sure it's the difference that you're arguing for.",
  "Can I ask you what your proposal is with regard to the contradictory regulations, 552.3 and 552. -- what is it, 109? I think they are contradictory. Now, the Agency has come up with a solution. We will interpret the former quite unrealistically to mean something that it doesn't seem to us to say but - - you know -- close enough for government work. What is your solution for solving the inconsistency? Are both of the regulations bad?",
  "What's your other reason?",
  "Because of employed and domestic employment versus - -",
  "-- domestic service?",
  "Well, you're getting into arguments now that are not about the regulation but they're about the statute. I'm assuming that we have regulations that are entitled to deference. And you have two regulations that are conflicting. Now, how do you decide which one prevails? Counsel for the other side says the specific governs the general, certainly an ancient prescription. Counsel also says that this is an agency regulation. The agency is given great deference in the interpretation of it own regulations. And even if the agency had said well, you know, they do conflict, we admit it, they totally conflict, we won't even try to reinterpret 552.3, we think that's the one that's wrong, why wouldn't we accept their statement to that effect?",
  "That's statutory. I just want to focus on the regulation arguments, not the statutory - -",
  "They aren't unambiguous. They contradict each other. The agency has to do something about it, and here the agency made a choice. Even if I assume the choice was, we're going to disregard 552.3, we're going to strike out those words, they were the mistake. One or the other had to be the mistake. We decided it was this one. Why shouldn't we take their word on it?",
  "Yeah, but interpretive regulations are in other areas wholly valid before the courts and entitled to Chevron deference, at least if they're adopted by notice and comment rulemaking. You know, we have nothing, what should I say, subordinate about interpretive regulations. In fact, probably most of the significant regulations of the most important agencies are interpretive regulations.",
  "I understand that you say it creates two types, but there is no indication that it intended one type of authority to be entitled to less respect from the courts than the other. What do you rely on for that?",
  "Where is the proposition that an interpretive regulation is somehow not a full-fledged binding regulation?",
  "They're different but not necessarily of different -- entitled to different respect from the courts. A defined -- what is it, define and delimit? These are regulations that don't even purport to be an interpretation of any language in the statute, but the use of authority given to the agency to cut out certain areas, to say the -- this rule won't apply to companies over this -- that can't possibly be an interpretation of the statute. So Congress says we're going to give the agency that authority. In addition, of course, we're going to give this agency the authority that every other agency has, which is to interpret -- interpret the language of the statute.",
  "Skidmore was before a rather significant case called Chevron.",
  "You mean we're going to divide all administrative law now into those -- those regulations -- those provisions that were adopted by Congress pre-Chevron and those adopted by Congress post-Chevron, and for the ones adopted pre-Chevron we're going to treat regulation as essentially suggestions by the agency which we give Skidmore deference to, and the ones after Chevron, we're going to treat differently. Do you have any case of ours that suggests something like that, which seems to me a very strange manner of proceeding?",
  "Except to the extent that a project may be endangering a species, not by reason of change in water quality but, for example, by destroying habitat, constructing a dam or that sort of thing.",
  "Where is this? Would you --",
  "Of - -",
  "270 you say?",
  "I got it.",
  "Can that be read just to apply to any, any State permits that -- that violate Clean Water requirements? As opposed to upland habitat which -- which might be affected?",
  "Well, how do you feel - -",
  "I thought that those are in place. As I understood Mr. Kneedler to say that that's exactly what they, what they continue to do.",
  "But that has nothing to do, as the Chief was about to say before I interrupted him, that has nothing to do with, with whether they have to issue the NPDES authorization.",
  "Could I get back to the memorandum of agreement that you've called our attention to on page 260? I read that paragraph, and I don't see anything in it that imposes any obligation whatever on the State. It is just a description of what -- what EPA is, is going to do.",
  "The same kind of consultation with Fish and Wildlife that, that Mr. Kneedler described to us.",
  "But this is talking about consultation when the permit is -- the permit application is issued. Not consultation at the, at the stage of approving the State plan.",
  "I don't know what you're talking about. Funding of what?",
  "How does the government fund it?",
  "Well, you -- you have other -- let's assume that I disagree with you on whether they could withhold approval of the NPDES transfer. Even so, I think you -- the point you're making now is that apart from that approval, there were other discretionary actions taken here, one of which is this funding; and another one of which, I believe, is whether -- never mind the MOAs, but -- I have it written down here, one of the other ones. Oh, whether existing permits would be transferred to State authority or not. And that is apparently discretionary and can be -- what do we do about that?",
  "I mean, that's not enough. Why wouldn't -- what would lead you to believe that it wouldn't -- that the same would not happen when the State issued the permits? I mean, you have to show some reason why we don't trust Arizona to do what the Federal government's doing.",
  "Well then, you have to establish jeopardy. You have to establish jeopardy. And the mere fact that you're giving it to a State which Congress has been willing to trust with implementing this law is not enough to show that there's jeopardy. Prima facie, we would expect Arizona to do the right thing.",
  "I don't understand - -",
  "I don't understand that answer. The Chief Justice is asking, if EPA cannot do it itself, how is it creating any jeopardy in transferring the authority to somebody else who can't do it?",
  "I mean, if you assume that EPA can't protect these plant species under its legislation, what harm is there in transferring the authority to somebody else who can't protect it?",
  "By coercing, by coercing the States to sign those agreements on pain of not getting NPDES authority?",
  "What do they do then? They just whistle and this comes forth? States don't sign stuff just, just for the sake of it.",
  "It's your position, not the Federal Government's position. It's your position of what the Federal Government's position ought to be, right?",
  "Mr. Kneedler, I hate to eat up any of your rebuttal time, but would you state briefly what -- how you would treat these other matters that were resolved by the agency and that were not mandatory, its decision to transfer prior certificate authority to the States, for example, and the other instance raised by opposing counsel? What if I agree with you on whether you can deny the NPDES permit, but I'm concerned about these other actions by the agency that were discretionary?",
  "Should we remand?",
  "Do you mean the executive can ignore earmarks?",
  "Did he say, \"for example,\" with regard to the quotation that Justice Ginsburg mentioned? I didn't recall that he said for example.",
  "Well, aren't we obliged under AEDPA to give deference to any reasonable conclusion from the facts?",
  "So even if it is just a conclusion, AEDPA still applies to it unless it's a totally unreasonable conclusion, right?",
  "Of course there is on demeanor. I mean, I suppose, to begin with, is it not the case that the burden is on the habeas applicant to show that demeanor did not make the difference? It's the burden on him to show that it was an unreasonable determination.",
  "And secondly, he could present such evidence if he showed that there was absolutely no ambiguity in what the person's statements said, so that demeanor could not have made a difference. But in a case where the statements are seemingly contradictory or arguably contradictory, demeanor is very relevant and it's the burden, it seems to me, of the Petitioner to show that demeanor wasn't what made the difference. And besides which, wasn't there some part of the record that you referred to where he said \"and I believe him\"?",
  "Well, you -- you -- you insist that he come out and say in so many words, I am going to be an unreliable juror. That's -- that's not the way it happens. And somebody has to evaluate whether indeed he's shading the truth a little bit and whether, in fact, he will be impaired in his service. And some of these -- some of these answers suggest that. And it, it is not an easy call to simply say well, you know, unless he comes out and admits yes, I'm going to be a lousy juror, nobody is going to say that.",
  "Why -- why was there no objection if this was so clear? If this fellow had answered all the questions the way you expect a, a good juror to answer, why was there no objection when the State moved to dismiss him?",
  "Well, that's fine. But, but competent counsel knows that getting something overturned on appeal is a lot harder than getting it done right the first time. And he also knows that if you raise an objection, you're more likely get it done right. I can't imagine why if he thought this person was not properly strikeable he would have sat - - indeed not just sat silent but said I have no objection. It just doesn't make any sense.",
  "Well, he made the same mistake the judge did. I wonder who else was there that made the same mistake. I mean, you know, it makes you think maybe, maybe the judge was right.",
  "Where -- where are you quoting from?",
  "75 of the - -",
  "How many days did this take?",
  "17 days? Less than one a day. That's pretty good.",
  "Well, but he said for one of the other witnesses, I just don't -- I don't believe him. And if that had been his problem here, he presumably would have said the same thing.",
  "Not if there's no opposing objection by defense counsel. When there was, and when part of his reason for granting the motion to strike the juror was demeanor, he mentioned demeanor.",
  "Of what law?",
  "Well, he said that, but elsewhere he sort of indicated that he couldn't consider it unless it were a situation in which this person would be able to commit the crime again.",
  "They did indicate that unless that was the situation, he wouldn't consider imposing the death penalty. I think that's precisely what they indicated.",
  "I like recidivate by the way. I'm going to use it in the opinion. It's a very useful verb.",
  "Ms. Seitz, I'd be curious to get your reaction to one of the points made by opposing counsel, which is that there were really sort of two different pieces of litigation at issue here, that it was an as-applied challenge that produced the preliminary injunction, and what was rejected in the final decision was a facial challenge. Is there anything to that?",
  "It is not a determination, is it, that they have a right to hold a demonstration?",
  "It is just a determination that we don't know at this point enough to say that you don't have a right.",
  "Well, I mean, what if - - what if there's nothing else he can do? What -- what horrible does he face? He faces a horrible of having to pay for his own litigation, just like the rest of us do. I mean this is an extraordinary benefit we're talking about here, getting -- getting your attorney's fees paid. I -- it doesn't seem to me that we're casting this, this person into the underworld.",
  "Excuse me. How can that be, that a preliminary injunction resolves a dispositive question of law? Does that happen?",
  "But it wasn't the issuance of the preliminary injunction that resolved it, it was the appeal to this Court where we -- we resolved a question of law.",
  "The point is you wouldn't mind putting that on a resume, that you have been subjected to a preliminary injunction.",
  "It's not a black mark on your name, is it?",
  "You haven't violated any Federal law.",
  "They are voluntary, these settlements, aren't they? So you could at least say that the innocent person who gets stuck with attorney's fees for settling gets what he asked for, right? It's voluntary.",
  "That may be, but that's not the way the statute is written.",
  "What if they got a TRO instead of a preliminary injunction?",
  "I know you aren't. Why not?",
  "What are the two? I mean, they prevailed. They have a TRO here, something of value.",
  "But it's just prevails. If you think \"prevails\" means you come out of there with anything that's worth something that has a contempt citation behind it, I don't see why a TRO wouldn't qualify.",
  "Even though you lost on the preliminary injunction? The fees that you reasonably expended in seeking a preliminary injunction, even though you lost, you'd be able to charge to the other side?",
  "Yes or no? I think you can answer yes or no.",
  "Okay.",
  "No. No. No. How much of it related to the preliminary -- you mean anything that related only to the preliminary injunction you would be denied?",
  "I don't know what you mean, if the decision on what? On the preliminary injunction?",
  "Is repudiated by the district -- how is it repudiated? What do you envision?",
  "In a later case, you mean?",
  "I thought the hypothetical was different, was, the case proceeds to final judgment on the merits; and at that point -- okay -- at that point, the issue of whether the preliminary injunction was valid or not comes up, not in the direct appeal from the preliminary injunction.",
  "Assume you win on the merits.",
  "That included a screen.",
  "But your people didn't want a screen.",
  "So they didn't get what they asked for.",
  "Well, that's only because, I guess the other side didn't take the action that they could have taken if they didn't -- if they didn't apply the screen.",
  "Did they conduct the demonstration with a screen or without a screen?",
  "Did they conduct the demonstration with or without a screen?",
  "And since they didn't use the screen, the State was not prohibited from arresting them; is that correct?",
  "So they did not get what they asked for. Mainly a prohibition against the state interfering with the kind of demonstration they wanted, which was one without a screen. You say they didn't get that.",
  "The state had no problem with that. In the past the State had let them do that, as long as they had the screen.",
  "But see, it's so extraordinary for somebody to make the other side pay for his attorney. We don't even do that -- we don't even do that for guilty people when they -- when the other side wins. So they have violated the law. We still don't make them pay the other side's attorney's fees. Now you want us to pay your client's attorney's fees even though you're not dealing with a guilty party, because ultimately the court found no, there really, this person didn't violate the law. That is -- you know, that's double indemnity. I mean, it's multiplying the extraordinary departure from our usual practice, which is that each side pays his own. It's one thing to say well, if you're a bad actor, in certain circumstances, civil rights cases, we'll make you pay the other side. But it's another thing to say if you're -- if you're not a bad actor in a civil rights case but you're unlucky enough to get hit with a preliminary injunction, we'll make you pay for the other side. It just grates that that -- it ain't fair.",
  "I assume that Congress doesn't often do things that are grossly unfair. And if there are various interpretations, one of which is not grossly unfair, that's the one we should - -",
  "Well, you surely wouldn't say that the fact that the other side never shows up means that you can't get your attorney's fees.",
  "So you're a prevailing party whether there's an adversary on the other side or not.",
  "But your claim here is not that they didn't apply the rules fairly, your claim is that they applied the rules.",
  "That's right. Fairly. Fairly as they were written. But you say even if they did apply them fairly, that's no good.",
  "I just wanted to be clear on that.",
  "But not beneficial to the system. That's why the organization didn't like it. And I wanted to come back to something you said just a minute ago, that there's an obligation under the First Amendment to weigh the effects of speech. Is there? I mean, suppose a government organization simply comes out with a rule that is perfectly fair, and that happens to give due weight to the fact that it's restricting speech, but the government organization has frankly never considered it. They didn't sit down around a table and say now, look, this is going affect speech, let's be careful here. They didn't do that. They just promulgated a perfectly reasonable rule. Wouldn't we uphold that?",
  "They don't have to consider the matter, do they? They just have to get it right, whether they considered it or not.",
  "Certainly. We have to do that. Certainly we have to do it in assessing whether, what the government has done is okay. But you're saying it's invalid unless the government gathers together a group of people just to shoot the breeze about -- I don't know of any of our cases that require that.",
  "Well, I mean, you may criticize them when they get it -- when it comes out wrong. Then you can say, when the result is wrong, they should have considered it. But when it comes out right? Do you have any case where it comes out right and it's perfectly reasonable, we say tsk, tsk, oh, but even though it came out right, they didn't consider speech? We've never said anything like that.",
  "That's where you had an approval system where one party would be approved and another one wouldn't. Of course, in that situation, you have to engage case by case in making the weighing. But this is not an approval situation. It's the issuance of a rule that applies to everybody.",
  "It was a letter from coach. It was a letter from coach. I mean, that to a young kid, that is recruiting. That is showing an interest on the part of the person who's going to decide who plays, an interest in you. I think it's entirely reasonable to consider that recruiting.",
  "And did it say, by the way, everybody got this letter? Did it say that at the bottom?",
  "Wait. I didn't understand that to be what the case said. I thought that the case held that it wasn't successive there because the claim had, in fact, been brought in the first petition, and that first petition was dismissed as premature. And the argument was made that this is just a continuation of that first petition. Now, the difference here is that the claim was not brought in the first petition, even though it was pretty clear after that case of ours that you had a sure route to raising the claim if you raised it prematurely, and then brought the petition later.",
  "The difference is that in Martinez-Villareal, it was plausible to say that this was not a second petition. Now you may be quite right, that there is good reason to say you shouldn't bring something that isn't ripe. But in that earlier case, we were able to get around the language of the statute which says a second or successive petition is not permissible. Here, how do you get around the language other than to say it shouldn't be that way, that you should be able to bring a second or successive petition when you're raising an issue that was not ripe at the time of the first petition? I mean, as a policy matter, that's a very good argument. But what do you do with the language in the statute? And after all, Congress is entitled to say -- to place limits upon our ability to review State court judgments.",
  "It doesn't say a second run at the same claim. It says a second petition. Even if you bring new petitions in your second claim that weren't raised in your first, it's still a second or successive petition, and I find it hard to get over that language.",
  "Before we get too far into the merits - -",
  "-- I, I'm not done about the jurisdiction yet. I wanted to ask you about the statement you made in response to a question; you said it's not successive and it isn't a second petition if the first one could not have been brought. Right? If the first one was unripe? But we've just decided this term that that's not the rule. In Burden, we -- we -- we said that even though a first, an earlier petition was unripe, the second petition was still a second petition. So that can't be the principle that you're espousing, unless you want us to overrule Burton the same term.",
  "These -- these were not appointed by the prosecutor; they were appointed by the court?",
  "Am I right?",
  "And you say that's inadequate. We have to have a full adversarial trial of psychiatric experts in every case where a prisoner claims that he's not mentally competent to be executed.",
  "It doesn't seem to me, and there's nothing in our history that requires, that you need a full dress trial to decide this issue. And it seems to me perfectly reasonable for the trial court to appoint experts, not selected by the prosecutor but selected by the judge, and have them conduct the -- the examination of the individual. I, I certainly don't want to -- you know - - a full dress trial on this issue in every case. And I, I don't know anything in our, in our tradition of due process that requires it.",
  "You -- you -- you did have your own expert, though? You had one expert of your own, right? No?",
  "Well.",
  "Who was - -",
  "This very important matter is going to be decided on the basis of the opinion of one, one justice, what, 30 years ago?",
  "You have no other appeal to a long tradition of how we determine this matter, but just one opinion by one justice because he was the lowest common denominator on the Court at that time. That seems to me very peculiar.",
  "We didn't have incarceration.",
  "We didn't have incarceration extending back a thousand years. We -- we had misdemeanors and felonies, all of which were punishable by death.",
  "More than that, the section goes on to make an exception from the bar of second or successive. The exception itself is a situation in which he could not have raised it earlier, namely he can get out of the bar if he shows that the claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law, which he couldn't have raised before, or the factual predicate didn't exist before, which he couldn't have raised before. All of those exceptions would be unnecessary if we interpret the provision itself to contain within it an exception for anything that couldn't have been raised before.",
  "The Constitution doesn't require Federal district court review.",
  "Okay, I got that. So should we treat this petition as if it's one for original habeas here?",
  "Rational understanding of what? That's -- that's the problem. Rational understanding of what. The State says he has rational understanding of the fact that he is going to die, and the reason he is going to die. Now, what -- what beyond that do you insist he have a rational understanding of?",
  "Where is (e)(2)? Is it produced in these materials. I got (e)(1); I don't have (e)(2). I don't really like talking about a section I don't have in front of me.",
  "Ah.",
  "That's one thing about this case I'm sure about.",
  "That's right.",
  "It's easy to see why the only cases you have relate to (e)(2) rather than (e)(1). (E)(2) which we don't have in the materials, but I have gotten a copy of it. And (e)(1) says that the Secretary \"may\" abate the assessment of all or any part. And those cases that denied it said this is discretionary; he doesn't have to. (E)(2) on the other hand, interest abated with respect to erroneous refund check, says the Secretary \"shall\" abate the assessment. So really, (e)(2) doesn't -- doesn't do you any good at all with respect to whether there was a cause of action before (h) was adopted.",
  "I see. What you're say is that cases that used to be bringable under (e)(2) would now be bringable only under (h) which would in effect be an implicit repeal of (e)(2).",
  "At least as far as suits elsewhere than in the tax court.",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Redding, let me come back to the phantom (e)(2) which we have finally traced down.",
  "I am not sure that (h) would impliedly repeal (e)(2), because (e)(2) is mandatory. There isn't any question under (e)(2) whether there has been an abuse of discretion. There is no discretion. It is mandatory to the extent that the Administrative Procedure Act would govern (e)(2), it would be for a violation of law not for abuse of discretion. So when (h) says the tax court shall have jurisdiction to determine whether the Secretary's failure to abate interest was an abuse of discretion, I would take that to apply only to (e)(1), which says the Secretary may abate and not to (e)(2) which says the Secretary shall abate. There is no question of -- of discretion in (e)(2) at all.",
  "It was a pretty good argument, I thought.",
  "What about those other sections, (c) and (d), which say the Secretary is authorized? Have there been cases which, which said that you could sue for, for his failure to make use of that?",
  "It's the same as with (e)?",
  "As with (e)(1).",
  "Did (h) apply to (e)(2) as well as to (e)(1)? Does it apply only to discretionary abatement provisions?",
  "So what happens with (e)(2)? You use the pay and sue provisions?",
  "I don't, I don't even think it's technically correct. How is it an abuse of discretion? He has no discretion. He must do it. How could you say he has abused his discretion? What discretion?",
  "But he doesn't even know what his tax liability is, especially in a partnership situation.",
  "He makes the partnership calculation, it goes to the IRS, and then they figure out what the tax is. And meanwhile, you know, the interest is running.",
  "This is quite a different argument. You're saying, you know, he should have paid the full tax in the first place, not he could have paid the interest that he knew was accruing.",
  "Excuse me. I didn't understand that. Say that again? There's no abatement for the interest that accrues until you're notified of what the - -",
  "The next thing you know, they will enact a progressive income tax.",
  "Is there a you cannot enter the courthouse provision here, or is it -- as I understand your case, it is that it remains discretionary with the Secretary with respect to people who have more money, but it is not discretionary with respect to people who have less money.",
  "So one has a cause of action and the other doesn't have a cause of action. And the difference you're making between the two is you're permitting the Secretary to waive the interest with respect to the rich. You're requiring him to do it with respect to the poor. Isn't that the difference?",
  "But it's permissive, not mandatory.",
  "But he doesn't have - -",
  "Wait a minute. They are not really saying that. They're saying it's totally within your discretion. You can't possibly abuse your discretion when you have total discretion. They're just saying, you know, do it if you want to do it.",
  "And I would not concede, as you seem to have, that the consequence of (h) is simply to open the door. I think the category of decisions that are committed to agency discretion by law within the meaning of the APA are agency decisions as to which the term \"abuse of discretion\" makes no sense. There's no such thing. It is totally committed to agency discretion. It's only other decisions that are not committed to agency discretion by law where you -- where the discretion can be abused. If you look at it that way, it isn't a matter of closing the door to one category and opening it to another; it's a matter of different substantive laws applying to the two, to the two classes. Anyway, I choose to look at it that way. You can talk - -",
  "Who said that?",
  "But you have to pay the costs. I mean, isn't that something of a disincentive? Before you can sue?",
  "Yes. It would be one thing if you skip away from a settlement without having to pay any money. But in order to come under, under 9607, they have to, they have to shell out the money.",
  "So you say there are two factors which still exert pressure to settle. One is that you don't have to bear the burden of showing that you conform with the national contingency plan, and second, that - -",
  "-- you insulate yourself from contribution suits by other people.",
  "Do you rely at all on -- in 9607(a)(b)? It says any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person. Does the word \"any\" add anything to your case? Do you think it urges us to give the broadest possible interpretation to other person?",
  "Other necessary costs?",
  "Now you say this very language that's in 107 now had been interpreted unanimously by the courts?",
  "So that part of your case is that, is to say that it's limited by 113 is to say that there's been an implied repeal.",
  "Unless all those cases were wrong.",
  "So it's not just a legislative history point you're making, it's not just a point as to what Congress's expectations were. It's also -- it's also a point that relates to implicit repeal.",
  "And if the Government's only strong point is that 113 is meant to coerce settlement, and 113 didn't exist before, then it must be very clear that previously 107 did give them a cause of action.",
  "No acorns on the other side.",
  "Why wouldn't the States prefer to proceed, to force people to proceed under 113, so that the States would have, you know, a hand in deciding how the cleanup should go? I don't -- I don't quite understand why you're here. I would have thought that the States' interest would be similar to the Government's.",
  "The last sentence of (f)(1), right?",
  "What's the meaning of that last sentence in (f)(1), \"Nothing in this subsection shall diminish the right of any person to bring an action of contribution in the absence of a civil action,\" of a civil action under 9606 or 9607? What are they referring to.",
  "State law?",
  "But even if there wasn't, you wouldn't have your principal argument, which is, you know, which is that the reason not to interpret 107 the way your friends on the other side want is that you're going to destroy the settlement provision of 113, which didn't use to exist. What argument would you make for having us read the word \"other\" in the what seems to me strange way you want?",
  "You're missing my point. My point is the settlement bar didn't used to exist. So previously, whether the cases were split or not, there was -- your best argument for the proposition that 107(a) does not permit suit did not exist.",
  "Assume it didn't exist. Assume that body of law didn't exist. But what would you have argued when somebody came in and said 107, this provision, includes PRPs? You may have argued -- your best argument would not have been available.",
  "Well, it's a direct product of the arrest, and if the arrest is legal, then it seems to me the search incident to the arrest is legal. And are you acknowledging that the arrest is legal, that whatever the exclusionary rule does, it does not require you -- when you've engaged in an unlawful seizure and you find an ax murderer sitting there in the car, you don't have to say sorry, I shouldn't have stopped the car. You can arrest the person, right?",
  "So the arrest is legal. If the arrest is legal, then the search incident to it must be legal.",
  "What if the car -- you know, the car doesn't come to a complete stop. The same facts that Justice Breyer just gave you. It's creeping along at, you know, a foot a minute. And then he says to these other people, you can jump out and go wherever you like, or you know, or go back to, to my partner's car. Then they wouldn't have been stopped; is that right?",
  "So you're putting all the eggs into the basket that the, the car came to a complete stop and therefore they have been seized. And what is crucial for the seizure is the elimination on motion on the part of the car.",
  "Any elimination of motion in a vehicle in which you are the passenger constitutes, at the request of the authorities, constitutes a seizure?",
  "But not if you're still rolling a little bit, a foot a minute.",
  "What about a shutdown of an airport? You know, there is word that somebody has been seen walking in with a bag of explosives or it looks like a bag of explosives, so they stop all planes on the tarmac, shut down all exits to the airport until they can ascertain what this bag is. Everybody in the airport and everybody in those planes has been seized for Fourth Amendment purposes?",
  "Okay, just the people who were trying to leave the airport. They had just arrived and they were going to go out to catch a cab and go home. They have been seized.",
  "Well, it turns out that there wasn't a bag of explosives and that no reasonable person would have thought. This was a knitting bag and some foolish cop thought it was a bag of explosives. That would have made it unreasonable. So everybody in the airport who is on the way home has been seized and has a cause of action.",
  "Even, even when the reason the driver is stopped is that a police officer whose car was alongside, he looks over there and he sees that it is some notorious felon who is in the back seat, and the only reason he stops the car is so arrest that felon? You would still say that, that the show of authority is only directed at the driver and hence it is only the driver that's seized?",
  "That's the right answer. I think you're being consistent. You have to say that. You have to say that.",
  "Tell the truth now.",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, but the policeman usually tells the drive and anybody else in the car: Stay in the car. Policemen don't like people jumping out of the car. They don't know why they're jumping out of the car. And I would certainly if I were a passenger not feel free to immediately open the door and start walking away, and if I did I would expect the policeman to tell me: Get back in the car. Isn't that, isn't that the normal procedure, to keep the occupants in the car until the policeman investigates?",
  "Well, even if he didn't tell me. I would have expected him to tell me. I wouldn't even open the door because I know he would tell me. I know that I'm not free to leave the car immediately until he investigates the stop.",
  "Right. I never pass a police car. I don't care how slow I'm going. I never pass a police car. I don't consider myself arrested just because that's the prudent thing to do, and it may well be a similar situation when you're sitting in a car that's been stopped by a traffic policeman.",
  "You're saying he doesn't have actual authority. If I understand you, you're saying he has no authority to stop an innocent passenger from walking away. Aren't you saying that? Unless there's some reason to hold a person in the car, he has no authority to stop him from walking away.",
  "What if I feel, even though that's the current state of the law, I wouldn't think of opening the door and walking away without asking the policeman, do you mind if I open the door and walk away? Does that suggest that I think I've been seized?",
  "Maybe we can just pass until the studies are done?",
  "What have we done in a case, and maybe we haven't had it, but what have we done in a case where there is a warrantless entry in violation of the Fourth Amendment of somebody's apartment, and there is a suitcase in there that does not belong to the owner of the apartment? My impression is that, that the owner of that suitcase has not been subjected to an unreasonable search and seizure; is that correct?",
  "Mr. Baker, I thought your position in your briefs, and I don't know why you do not make this reply to this exchange, is that the merger with another plan is not a termination, isn't that your basic position?",
  "Because if it were a termination, in a termination, you must distribute the assets to the participants. And here when you merge with somebody else, the assets are not distributed to the participants, but they are thrown into a pot with other people.",
  "He doesn't like to hear that he is wrong.",
  "Maybe it's a simpler argument than this first one we've been wrestling with.",
  "Of course this argument would not have any force whatever if indeed, transferring the assets to another plan does not constitute a termination of the plan.",
  "But the first step would be the transfer. And at that, at that stage it would not be a termination and therefore it would not be within the authority of the administrator under this provision.",
  "That's fine, but that still does not convert the termination decision into, into a, an administrator's decision, rather than a sponsor's decision.",
  "Sure, you can oversee it and make sure that there is no hanky-panky going on in the two-step process but the -- but the determination whether to terminate or not is a sponsor's determination.",
  "But they, but they don't say that in, in looking at the two of them, you suddenly transform the decision whether to, to transfer as -- as a termination. You transfer that decision from the plan sponsor to the administrator.",
  "Right. And -- and the argument your adversaries make is that termination requires that the plan assets be distributed to the beneficiaries.",
  "And that in the case of a merger the assets are not distributed to the beneficiaries, they are distributed to this new plan, which benefits not only the beneficiaries of this plan but the beneficiaries of other plans.",
  "Right. But now, does indeed the transfer here meet the requirement of little (i)? Does the transferee plan undertake an irrevocable commitment to provide to these beneficiaries all that they're entitled to, even at the expense of some of the other beneficiaries of that plan? In other words, if the plan's investments go south does that plan have the authority to say, oh, you know, our first payments have to go to the beneficiaries under this plan that was transferred and the rest of you will get, will get the leavings? I don't think that the plan has the authority to do that.",
  "Does it make a commitment, a commitment to fully provide all benefit liabilities under the now deceased plan?",
  "The other side said that the district court found that the argument was waived, or the court of appeals did.",
  "Well, I don't think, I just don't read 1341 the way you do. It seems to me that little (i) at the top of your page 2a is a safe harbor. I don't think that the, even if it is a fiduciary decision that he has to, once he has found an insurer that is rock solid, that is willing to provide all the benefit liabilities, I don't think he has to look throughout the rest of the world to see if there is anything that might be better for his plan participants. I think that's a safe harbor and if he purchases an irrevocable commitment from an insurer and then that insurer is as solvent as any other insurer he is home free. You're saying he is not home free. He has to consider little (ii) and see what other ways of fully providing all benefit liabilities might be better for the plan participants. I -- I think that's, that's placing on him an obligation that I don't see there.",
  "I'm not sure I understand what you mean by a reversion to the employees who have made contributions. They get their cash back?",
  "Right.",
  "Of course you could say the same thing if the mission here sold its property to someone and someone was claiming the right to possess the property by reason of the sale. And you could come up and say this is simply, simply a case deciding the, the ultimate issue of whether the sale occurred or not.",
  "But it would clearly come within the property right exception, wouldn't it? You -- you don't go one step back to look at the transaction that created the, the right in real property assuming the right in real property exists.",
  "Let's assume that, let's assume that exception didn't exist.",
  "And you had nothing but the real estate exception. You would come in and say this ultimately relates to not who owns the real estate but whether there was a proper contract or not. And I - - frankly we wouldn't accept that.",
  "Can't he force a sale of the property to collect the lien?",
  "I understand that this action does not because of the sovereign immunity. But -- but we are talking about what the nature of a lien is. In an ordinary case cannot a lien holder force a sale of the property so that he can get out the money represented by his lien?",
  "Well, how can he commence an action to foreclose on the property unless he in any ordinary sense of the term has an interest in the property?",
  "You're distinguishing between rights in property and interests in property? I would think that every right in property is an interest in property and vice versa.",
  "Congress didn't really say it. I mean the committee said it to be precise.",
  "Good.",
  "That's not beyond the realm of the conceivable, is it?",
  "Why isn't buying land that you're not using for your embassy itself, or for the residence of the ambassador, but buying and occupying that land which subjects yourself to real estate taxes on that land, why isn't that a commercial activity?",
  "So the Indian embassy could own real estate throughout New York City, which it wouldn't have to pay taxes on? Or if it didn't, nothing could be done about it?",
  "Why? No. You're saying, you're saying it's not a commercial activity. I mean - -",
  "It depends upon the use, and the use in this case is not -- is not the embassy itself or the residence of the ambassador. I mean, they could use a piece of property for anything.",
  "But the buying and occupying of it is commercial activity.",
  "Of course, this isn't a suit for the taxes. I mean, we are not talking about a suit for the taxes.",
  "We are talking about a declaration as to the interest in the land.",
  "That's always brought up to answer the problem, well, you know -- let me give you a case in which it obviously is not a commercial activity, but it seems to me that the -- that the lien interest has to be honored. Let's suppose that there is an American who is very friendly to and sympathetic with the Indian government, and gives them real estate, not a commercial activity, he gives them real estate in which to house the employees in -- in their mission. However, he retains an interest in that real estate. He retains a lien on the real estate, to have money paid to him at some point. He is not willing to give the full amount of the property, but most of it. And he retains a lien. Now, under your theory, that lien would not be enforceable, is that right?",
  "Enforceable or not.",
  "That seems very strange to me.",
  "What property is it a right in if not the immovable property?",
  "And it follows that immovable property and when the immovable property disappears the lien disappears. You know, if it's blown away or flooded, it's now in the Atlantic; the lien is gone.",
  "But otherwise wherever the property goes the lien follows it. How can you say that that's not an interest in the property?",
  "It doesn't have to be a right in the property. If you look at it from the owner's point of view, it is a cloud on the owner's title in the property. It affects the owner's title. Even if you assert that it doesn't give any title to the lien holder, it impairs the title of the property owner. And that's all that's required, as I read the title, in which rights in immovable property are an issue, and here the question is whether the, the mission's right to the property is, is impaired by this lien.",
  "It affects the right to convey the property free and clear, which is an enormous right that goes along with the real estate.",
  "What about an easement? That doesn't involve any of those things. You can't exclude people and so forth.",
  "Mr. Cardozo, before you go any further, I had been under the impression from your brief that you're not trying to enforce anything against, against India or against the mission. You just said you wanted a declaratory judgment that the lien is a valid lien. But, but here it is in your complaint you're asking for foreclosure. Which, which is it?",
  "You just asked for it to scare them? Was that it?",
  "Well, but they'll say as was their response to a lot of hypotheticals, the commercial act exception covers that.",
  "Why didn't you just say - - you know, if you're worried about the malevolence of countries to make all sorts of stuff liens, I guess if they're malevolent enough they can make all sorts of stuff easements, which, which the other side says is undoubtedly a property interest. So they could say that, you know, if you're held liable the court can give you an easement over the property of, of the defendant worth so much money. And that would undoubtedly be enforceable.",
  "Do you know any States that don't? Isn't it fairly standard? For - -",
  "Yeah.",
  "The -- the -- the European, the European treaty looks at it from the other side, you're saying. It looks at it from the foreign sovereign side.",
  "Would the obligations arising out of the property in the European Convention include the obligation to pay taxes, property taxes?",
  "This says what explicitly?",
  "Can I ask you what, what do you get out of this case? You've withdrawn your claim for judgment of foreclosure. What are you going to get out of it? Declaratory judgment that they owe the taxes? I'm not sure they have ever contested that they don't owe taxes.",
  "Yeah, but - -",
  "You say he is wrong about a lot of other stuff.",
  "Why do you believe him about that?",
  "Well, wait a minute. But the -- the embassy has rights in it when the case is brought, even before the final judgment. So you know, let's give the devil his due. It would be a case in which rights in immovable property are in issue.",
  "You want to look at it from the embassy side too so - -",
  "Well, that's your big defense. To do that they would have to do it for everybody' they would have to do it for Joe Sixpack as well as for the embassy, right?",
  "What do you do with traffic tickets? They've built up. You know, there's $100,000 owing in traffic tickets by some embassy. How do you get a judgment that that is owing?",
  "So you can't use even the foreign aid gimmick to - -",
  "You mean we'll have to start paying our taxes around the world?",
  "Is that a real problem for us? I don't think so.",
  "Which is what the statute says, and so how could the statute possibly be unconstitutional?",
  "I mean, the Constitution - - I mean, the statute has within itself a Speech or Debate Clause exception. Now, I guess you can argue that a lower court might not accurately provide the Speech or Debate Clause protection that is due, but that, that doesn't meet, it seems to me, the, the jurisdictional requirement that, that the constitutionality of the statute be called into question.",
  "Well, that doesn't comply with Section 412, which says that an appeal may be taken directly to the Supreme Court from \"any interlocutory or final judgment decree of order of court upon the constitutionality of any provision of the Act.\" Now, and as-applied challenge is not a challenge to the constitutionality of the provision.",
  "My problem is, it's extraordinary. We have very few direct appeal cases any more and I, I am loathe to read Section 412 as embracing a decision by a court that a particular use of this statute was unconstitutional. You say it was, the statute was unconstitutional as applied. That's sloppy language. It really means that this application of the statute or the use of the statute for this purpose was unconstitutional. I think that's something different from saying that it was an order of the court upon the constitutionality of any provision. Which provision of this Act has been held to be unconstitutional?",
  "Which -- but it hasn't been held to be unconstitutional. It's perfectly constitutional. You're just saying it can't be used in this particular case.",
  "I mean, read the language. It says \"The constitutionality of any provision of this act,\" not \"the constitutionality of the application of any provision of this act.\"",
  "What -- what had the lower court held? It isn't a question of what we held; it's a question of what the lower court had held. Had the lower court held that it was unconstitutional?",
  "I mean, but that can mean -- you can always dispose of a, of a facial challenge by just saying we don't have to reach the facial question; we can decide it on an as applied question. But in order to get here in the first place, it has to be a challenge to the constitutionality of a provision of the Act.",
  "Well, he didn't do exclusively that stuff anyway. We can certainly all agree on that. And why isn't it sufficient that when any of those issues are, his activities in any of those capacities are sought to be introduced into evidence, anyone tries to contradict them, then you can bring in your Speech or Debate Clause objection?",
  "Why is the whole suit precluded?",
  "Maybe he was the 23rd self.",
  "I think you have to figure out when he was hired.",
  "There's never an office. I mean, I think the office is just a fictional construct anyway. So what you say now has nothing to do with whether, whether this current Senator has, has departed from the scene. Even if he were still on the scene, there still wouldn't be any such thing as that office. It's just a fiction, and it would always be a suit against Congress, and so you say none of these suits can ever be brought.",
  "Why isn't it a waiver of sovereign immunity when you set up a suit that envisions a suit which will be paid off by the Senate? Why isn't that a waiver of sovereign immunity?",
  "A physical, a physical office, yes. I mean, they didn't work in the hallway. But their staff salary was not paid out of their, quote, \"office.\" It was paid out of the Senate.",
  "Setting it is quite different from paying it.",
  "The Senator sets it and the Senate pays it.",
  "Right. The Senate puts a limit on how much money it will spend for a particular Senator. That's all that amounts to. It doesn't hand him the money. It's still the Senate's money, isn't it? And what the Senate says is each office will have so much of a call upon our fund and no more.",
  "The other side's contention is that the firing is itself a legislative act and so when you challenge the firing you are challenging the legislative act. What do you say to that?",
  "It wouldn't matter anyway, because our prior decisions that do not explicitly refer to jurisdictional questions are not authority on jurisdiction.",
  "We have that firm rule: When we take a case and don't get into the jurisdictional question, it is not precedent for the fact -- -",
  "Yes. That, that may make sense. I, I wondered why -- why they would provide for an appeal on constitutionality if they had in mind the Speech or Debate Clause stuff, when the legislation itself says that nothing herein shall be deemed a violation of speech.",
  "Yeah.",
  "Do they cite any particular document or statement - -",
  "-- that constitutes the delegation?",
  "Do all these contracting cases involve the contractor imposing law upon somebody, executing law? On behalf of the Government?",
  "Because that's your test. I mean, and if that is the proper test, it ought to apply in the Government contractor situation, too. So, for example, the Government can hire a private company run prisons; but that would be the Government hiring somebody to perform Government - - Government functions. Now, do all of those -- a function that remain as Government function, keeping the incarcerated incarcerated. Now do, do all of the contract cases involve that?",
  "Well - -",
  "But that puts a whole new theory on your - -",
  "Oh.",
  "And he was acting under color of law as you've described that in your petitions? I don't think so.",
  "Well, I, I it seems to me color of office, you say color of office, it means that its appearance to somebody else is that -- that he is being an official. And I would think that that requires the fact that he's assisting a Government agent in enforcing the law against somebody.",
  "Just out of curiosity, what, what happens to the, the employees of the private companies that run prisons? Could they removed under this provision?",
  "They either run the prison for a State, or for the Federal Government.",
  "-- or the Federal Government.",
  "Is that the test here? Is that the test here? If it is State action, it is covered by this statute. If it isn't, it is not?",
  "But suppose it doesn't.",
  "Should I conclude it therefore is not covered?",
  "Do they test their products before they're marketed under rigid Federal testing regulations which are supervised by the Federal Government?",
  "Is the Government supervising those?",
  "Yeah, but is there some Government official who's there to make sure that the testing is being done the way, the way it's supposed to be, which is what, what is argued is the case here?",
  "They don't have to be there every day.",
  "Policing - -",
  "I have a contract to provides food to the Senate cafeteria, okay. And the Senate or maybe the Executive Branch, for that matter, closely supervises my preparation and service of that food. Am I acting under, even though I'm not assisting the Government in any governmental function at all? Don't you have to be assisting in the performance of a governmental function?",
  "They are called FTC ratings?",
  "And they are called -- in the regulations it's called the FTC test, even after it has been done by the companies?",
  "That's very careless, isn't it?",
  "Have, have they imposed its official -- has it imposed, the FTC, its official results on any company that was not a participant in this -- in this testing lab?",
  "Your case would be stronger if they weren't doing it just for themselves. If in fact that they were doing it for the FTC who imposed it even on somebody else.",
  "Yeah.",
  "Because here you're doing it for yourself. You want to advertise low -- low - - low tar cases. And the FTC says the only way we'll let you do it, the only way we'll let do you that advertising is if you test them pursuant to this, this system that we established. And you say okay. We'll test them pursuant to the system you've established and -- and everybody goes happily away.",
  "Well that's a good, that's a good preemption argument.",
  "I'm not sure it has much bearing upon whether - -",
  "It all comes back to me now, that case you mentioned. Lip drape, that was the lip drape case, wasn't it, where people smoke differently because some of them cover up the holes in the filter when their lips -- the lip drape. The naked lip drape.",
  "Well, how many others involve the agency calling the result of the private action the FTC figures and the FTC test?",
  "But they don't -- they don't put it out to the public as the Federal Government's figures.",
  "That makes a big difference.",
  "Just don't call it the Government's test. Don't call it the Government's figures. Call it the industry's figures.",
  "Maybe we were wrong last time.",
  "Well, we didn't have a concrete case such as this one, in which the assertions of the other side are very appealing as far as the rights of citizens to band together for an issue ad, even an issue ad that names somebody who's up for election within, within 90 days. We didn't that have appealing case before us. Now that we have it before us and now that you tell us that this is a typical case, maybe we were wrong about the overbreadth challenge before.",
  "Well, did that statement refer only to issue ads, or did it refer to all ads?",
  "Right, and here we are dealing with a subset of all ads and that is issue ads. So that statement doesn't necessarily speak to whether, you know, a vast majority of all issue ads have to be - -",
  "I don't know if that's so. So long as that statement applied to the totality of ads, many of which were ads just directed at defeating particular candidates, I don't see how you can see that we're bound by that statement.",
  "Everything that is not express advocacy is an issue ad? The world is divided into express advocacy and issue ads?",
  "I wouldn't divide it that way. I would think there are a lot of express advocacy ads. I think there are a lot of non-express advocacy ads that are not issue ads.",
  "It doesn't your case, with me at least, for you to tell us that it is your job to say that no as-applied challenge will suffice.",
  "I mean, that doesn't inspire me with confidence in what you're telling us.",
  "No. There is -- there is a claim here that there -- that there was difficulty in setting, setting up a fund in time to do what had to be done with respect to this issue, which was a distinctive issue that had come up and they said we didn't have time to set up a - a - a - a separate PAC that, that would effectively meet the problem. Why isn't that distinctive enough?",
  "Well now -- but -- yes, it may make the difference in a close election but it is also, it is also likely to be more effective with regard to the Senator that you -- whose vote you want on the issue. Are you, are you going to waste your, waste your money in, in those districts where the Senator is not going to vote the way you want no matter what? The situation you pose is precisely the one where you would want your issue ad to run.",
  "Of course.",
  "To get the Senator's attention.",
  "The Senator who is, who is at risk is likely, is likely to listen. The Senator who has a safe seat is not.",
  "You can't tell which of the two they had in mind. Whether they wanted the Senator defeated or they wanted to put enough pressure on the Senator that he would change his vote with regard to the filibuster. I would think that the latter is more likely the motive than the former. And why do you assume the worst?",
  "But this is -- this is the First Amendment. We don't make people guess whether their speech is going to be allowed by Big Brother or not. If you are going to cut off the speech, there ought to be a clear line. Not whether -- whether I, I had ads against Feingold in the past or whether Feingold voted 20 times against this or, or half of the time against this. It seems to me you need a clear First Amendment line. And you're not giving us any.",
  "That vast majority thing, is that a -- was that the holding of the case? I mean --",
  "Every -- every -- every word that we it uttered in that prior case is law? I mean, what if -- am I free to think -- is the lower court free to think that maybe it is really not the vast majority? But just because we said vast majority, it is like writing it into the statute?",
  "Yeah.",
  "Is this true of the NRA also? Is it the case that they have never targeted, so to speak, a particular legislator?",
  "I don't think they would either. Why pick on the ACLU?",
  "You are asking for that among other things, aren't you?",
  "Why do you say that those issue ads are inconsistent with the Government's position here?",
  "You haven't explained that. You're just - -",
  "When they put these exhibits, were those exhibits complete with context?",
  "I didn't think so. They just -- just like the ads were.",
  "It's pretty easy to tell whether you're giving money to the money to the candidate or not, isn't it?",
  "That's a fairly bright line that you don't have to worry about stepping over the wrong side of it.",
  "Whereas this one, especially if you adopt a context determination that requires a 1,000-page district court opinion, who knows.",
  "What's your test? Their test is fuzzy, I agree with you. What's yours? Do you have a clear one that does not invalidate the whole statute?",
  "That says what's good. What is your test for what's bad?",
  "Mr. Bopp, you do not have to establish, do you, that the test you propose will get at every bad ad, that it will be sure to get at every ad that is not a genuine issue ad? Is that the burden on you?",
  "I thought when we're dealing with the first amendment we give wide scope to the principle that it is, it is better to allow, you know, some bad speech than it is, in the effort to get rid of that bad speech, to eliminate any good speech that is justified. So even if there is something that might sneak through that does achieve what Congress didn't want to achieve, the answer in the First Amendment is that's too bad. There's some stuff you just can't get at. There's a lot of bad speech that is allowed all the time because you can't get at it without suppressing the good speech.",
  "You could say yes to that, I think.",
  "He fears the Greeks even when they bear gifts.",
  "Does that go to their meaning or to the intent of -- is that what governs? It's the intent of the person who puts it on? I thought -- I thought you were focusing on the meaning of it, what it conveys to the public.",
  "That's new to me. I thought you were asking us to look at the meaning. What does it mean to the - -",
  "It could be as long as 200 days; isn't that correct.",
  "You have to speculate before you try to put the ad on.",
  "You have to speculate whether the Court is going to say well, since you're in the zone of three different radio stations or television stations, a different rule applies. Doesn't the person who wants to speak have to speculate, roll the dice?",
  "You've added something to the question, though, didn't you?",
  "Attending public school and receiving - -",
  "I thought it wasn't that. I thought it was simply Congress figured that there are probably a lot of people in New York City, in Manhattan in particular, who are going to send their kids to private school, no matter what, and they can get special services in private school, but what the heck, if we can get $30,000 from the city to pay for it, that's fine. In other words, this was meant to be an option for people who wanted to go to the public schools but couldn't go to the public schools because they couldn't get the private services there, but it was never meant to be an option for people who had no desire to go to public schools at all anyway, and - -",
  "-- and without this condition, somebody, I think the plaintiff here was never in the public school, was he?",
  "Yes, but that is -- but the parent would not have to show that the parent would have used that available public remedy - -",
  "-- if it were there?",
  "Of course, to be fair, this provision doesn't just apply to the rich person who wants New York City to pay 30,000 of his tuition to a private school. It also applies to somebody who is already in public school, and the program offered by the -- by the city is patently inadequate. You are compelling the parent nonethe less to put the kid in a program that anybody would see will -- will not meet the needs.",
  "The parent would presumably cover themselves, look it, he's getting X,Y -- X, Y, and Z in the private school and you're going to give him Z; Z is not going to be enough. And the burden on you would be upon you to say, oh, we think Z is enough.",
  "What did it do, then? What meaning do you give to it?",
  "I don't understand that. It makes it very clear it is, it is (ii) which authorizes the enrollment in a private school and payment for that. And it is prefaced with a condition: If the parents of a child with a disability who previously received special education and related services under the authority of the public agency, enroll the child in a private -- the implication is if there were parent of a child who was not so enrolled, this provision does not apply. So then you fall back on the fact that the old provision covered in our cases would have applied but that makes this meaningless. I mean if you say that our prior cases overrode that limitation, then what purpose does the limitation serve?",
  "Where else does it say that the city will pay for the cost of a private education except there? That's the only place it says it. And part of the requirements for getting it is that the child was receiving service at a public institution.",
  "I'm not sure I agree -- Im not sure I would agree with you that you could get special services which --in third grade and then come back 10 years later and get private school tuition. I would really read this as saying if the parents of a child who previously received special education under the authority, enroll the child in a public elementary school -- I think that there has to be a temporal connection between the prior receipt and the enrollment. I don't think you can go back 10 years.",
  "You don't have to read it that way, anyway.",
  "Once you're in the private school reimbursement you're in the private school reimbursement, but you can't get into it 10 years later. Anyway, that issue is not -- not before us today. I don't understand you assertion that somehow this would amount to repeal by implication. The provision of 1415 -- what is it, (b), (b)(3) -- it seems to me is just like a provision for, for a court's exercise of its equitable powers. \"Shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate\" -- if a court had granted some equitable relief in one case, and then there is a statute that's passed which renders that equitable relief no longer appropriate, I wouldn't say that that -- that that amounts to a repeal by implication. It's just that what is appropriate depends upon the remainder of the statue, and as it exists at the time that the relief is sought.",
  "Bingo. You got me on that.",
  "No, he hasn't -- he hasn't said that.",
  "Under a different statute.",
  "You are interpreting some very general language: \"Shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.\"",
  "So does the 10-business-days notice requirement for people who are in public schools also violate Burlington, because for 10 business days they are going to be subject to an inappropriate education?",
  "Well, that's no problem. I mean both sides agree that you can move to a private school if that's so; right?",
  "Except those -- there are a lot of parents who are going to send their parents to private school, no matter what. They are well-heeled and this is just an opportunity to have New York City pay $30,000 of it.",
  "Even the child who would turn down the adequate education provided by the public schools. I don't think that was the intent of the statute.",
  "If they don't have an adequate placement, they should not have to pay the freight for people who would not be coming to public school any way. That's what this provision prevents.",
  "We know what -- what it's going to be like. We don't know the exact phrasing on the ballot, but we do know that a candidate is allowed to associate himself with a party, but a party is not allowed to disociate itself from the candidate. I am less concerned about the fact that the candidate can't say I'm the -- I'm the no-taxes candidate, than I am about the fact that he can associate himself with the Republican Party or the Democratic Party on the ballot and that party has no opportunity on the ballot to say, we have nothing to do with this person. That it seems to me is a great disadvantage to the parties.",
  "I'm not talking about a First Amendment forced association. I'm talking about an association for purposes of making this a fair election at which the parties have an opportunity to nominate and support their own candidates. And what this system creates is a ballot in which an individual can associate himself with the Republican Party, but on the ballot the Republican Party is unable to dissociate itself from that candidate.",
  "Will, will it say whether the party that is preferred likes this candidate?",
  "I think you can say yes or no to that. Will it say whether the party for which he expresses a preference claims or disclaims him?",
  "Please answer yes or no. Will it say whether the party for which he has expressed a preference claims or disavows him?",
  "All right.",
  "Is -- Iis there any, what should I say, truth investigation by the State of Washington? Suppose a candidate who has been a Democrat all his life, has run for office as a Democrat, agrees with all the positions of the Democratic Party, chooses to state on the ballot: I prefer the Republican Party. That's okay?",
  "I guess -- how can you say it's false?",
  "If he thinks he prefers it, I guess he prefers it, even though it's contrary to his entire life.",
  "I don't think it's enough that -- that there's no claim of party endorsement. There is a claim of associating himself with the party, and if he associates himself with the party it seems to me the party should be able to disassociate itself from him. And I think it harms the party not to permit that.",
  "General McKenna, I'm interested in how this new system meshes with the otherwise quite partisan nature of Washington's election laws. For example, the major political parties have a certain -- certain benefits that are not given to minor parties, and the major parties are determined on the basis of obtaining more than a certain percentage, I think it's 5 percent, in a statewide election. How are you going to figure out whether the Republican Party has, has gotten more than 5 percent when all you have is somebody who expresses a preference for the Republican Party, although he's not really a Republican?",
  "And they have not devised a structure that we know of?",
  "One of the briefs says that the Republicans -- I think the Republicans or the Democrats checked with the, with the State election officials who said that there's no provision for convention, for nomination by convention.",
  "So they can-- they can conduct conventions if they wish?",
  "I didn't understand you to say that you have a right to a partisan process in which your -- only your nominee is shown. I thought you're saying that if it is a process in which party affiliation is shown, then your endorsed candidate should be set aside somehow.",
  "I suppose you could say the same thing about the candidates' party preferences. They can make that known to the voters in the newspapers when they run.",
  "I don't have the Republican Party endorsement, but I prefer the Republican Party.",
  "I thought you said the State's interest was to -- to do what we disapproved in Jones without seeming to do what we disapproved in Jones.",
  "I did, too.",
  "You should have said that.",
  "Maybe that was wrong. Maybe the Sentencing Commission should have, in order to be faithful to the Congressional determination, should have done it quite proportionately. I mean, I'm not hung up on what the Sentencing Commission said. I'm hung up on what the courts should do now.",
  "Indeed, it may be quite impossible to achieve uniformity through advisory guidelines, which is why Congress made them mandatory.",
  "And you don't say -- you don't say anything goes. I mean, the hypothetical that Justice Alito gave is -- is easy, only because Congress has created the 100 to 1 ratio as presumably reasonable. If Congress enacted it as a statute, it has to be reasonable. So that enables you to say anything from 1 to 1 to 100 to 1 is reasonable. But your position is not anything goes. It's anything that's reasonable goes.",
  "Only because Congress has said 100 to 1. That strikes me as utterly unreasonable. But if Congress has said it, it can't be unreasonable. That's what makes that an easy hypothetical, but that would not be the normal case, that a 100 to 1 disparity wouldn't be -- would not be unreasonable.",
  "Well, that's why -- and the 1993 statute that you said, that you referred to, did indeed require the guidelines to track the -- the statutory prescriptions for sentencing.",
  "Pardon me?",
  "2003. Sorry. I misspoke. But -- but the fact remains that the Guidelines are only guidelines and that still doesn't- - doesn't convert to an obligation for the district courts to follow that scheme so long as that scheme is only reflected in the guidelines. The guidelines themselves are still just advisory.",
  "Well, why don't you just skip the Guidelines and say that the effect of the sentencing statute is to make it unreasonable for a sentencing judge -- never mind the Guidelines -- to do anything other than follow the 100 to 1 prescription that Congress has established?",
  "I don't know what the Guidelines add to -- to your game except another - - another stage.",
  "Well, I would say that that statute reflects Congress's desire that sentencing, whether it's through the commission or not, be based on the 100 to 1 ratio.",
  "It seems to me that the gap in your argument is that whatever Congress legislated, it did not legislate the manner in which you transferred this 100 to 1 ratio onto the sentencing chart. And as your opponent points out, it isn't done proportionally. It could have been done in a lot of different ways.",
  "Maybe. But there are other logically proportional manners of doing it. Why would the district court be bound to the particular one that the Sentencing Commission chose?",
  "That's fine. I'm granting that they got a start where Congress did. I'm assuming that. But why do they have to follow it through the way the Sentencing Guidelines did?",
  "Lex Luthor might.",
  "Well, you don't -- you don't have to answer all of these things for your case, do you?",
  "You're not saying that a reasonable person couldn't have found the opposite. You're just saying that a reasonable person could have found what this district judge found.",
  "So why don't you just swallow all these things and say, yeah, I suppose the court of appeals could say that, but - -",
  "-- but my point stands?",
  "It looked at them. It didn't necessarily follow them.",
  "With white collar crime, for example, it went vastly higher than what had been the practice.",
  "And another circuit would develop the opposite. I mean, this circuit would say that 17 is unreasonable. The other circuit would say that 19 is unreasonable. And we would have to sort out all those things ultimately, right?",
  "In kind of a sentencing review court?",
  "Of course, all these questions only -- only apply to departures downward from the Guidelines, and if you ask the same question with regard to departures upward you do run into constitutional problems when the -- when courts of appeals begin to establish certain facts that have to be found in order to move upward or -- yes, certain facts that justify moving upward. So you end up with a quite skewered system in which there is -- there is vigorous hearty review of departures downward, but -- but very, very slight review of departures upward.",
  "You think that's unreasonable?",
  "Excuse me. You're saying they can't disagree with the policy. They can only - - only say there are special facts in this case that were not taken into account in the policy. But you're saying they are bound by the policy set forth in the Guidelines. That's not my understanding of either Apprendi or Booker.",
  "Which yes and which no?",
  "It has to be relevant to the case, Of course.",
  "Of course.",
  "I don't know what you mean by rationally grounded in the case before them. Let's take the question of whether you should give higher sentences for crack cocaine than for powder cocaine. Why can't the district court simply disagree with the fact that the Guidelines said you should give a 100 times more for the one than for the other? Why can't the district court just say, that seems to me a very erroneous judgment by -- by the Sentencing Commission?",
  "I see. It must follow the Guidelines,",
  "It just has to consider them. It did consider them and said: I disagree with that judgment of the Guidelines.",
  "This case involves cocaine.",
  "What if -- what if the sentencing judge simply disagrees with the Guidelines? He just simply disagrees with the severity of the sentence that the Guidelines impose? He's free to do that, isn't he?",
  "And so long as that disagreement is reasonable, so long as another sentencing commission might indeed have imposed a lower sentence -- for antitrust violations, if indeed all the Federal Courts before -- before the Guidelines came into effect were rarely imposing any prison sentences, how could you say it would be unreasonable for a district judge to say, I simply agrees with what the Guidelines -- with what the Sentencing Commission did, and I agree with all of those sentencing courts before then, which thought -- which thought only in a rare case should there be jail time? How could you possibly say that that's unreasonable?",
  "But we also made it very clear that the Guidelines are advisory, and there is - - there is no way to a maintain that with the -- with the kind of approach that you're offering. They aren't advisory. They're pretty much mandatory. You depart too much and you'll be called to account.",
  "You cannot disagree on policy with the Guidelines, then, at least not fundamentally?",
  "I don't know how that - - that fits in with your prior statement.",
  "Well, then -- then you're just blowing smoke when you say that the Guidelines are advisory. What you're saying is the criterion for fairness is the Guidelines and if you go too far one side or the other of the Guidelines, you're not being fair. That -- that's not -- that's not advisory. That's the Guidelines as a criterion of sentencing.",
  "Well, he did that here. He said, you know, I think a young person like this - - other people may feel differently, but I think somebody at 21 really is -- is not -- his brain isn't fully formed and we should give him another chance.",
  "We should probably make them mandatory.",
  "We're trying to development a rule here that can be applied sensibly by all the courts of appeals when they are reviewing the innumerable sentences of federal district judges. And you have -- you haven't given me a rule. I have no idea -- if I were sitting on the court of appeals, I would have no idea when I can do it and when I can't do it. The notion of reasonableness, you know, whether a reasonable person could have given a sentence of this sort despite the fact that it is not what the Sentencing Commission did, that's -- that's something you can work with, but I don't understand what your rule is.",
  "I wouldn't say -- I wouldn't say that. There are -- there are certain - - certain limits where you would -- the example you gave of that kind of an acceleration of the penalty, and I can see giving this person no jail time whatever would be extreme. But if you are trying to get a narrow range of sentences out of the guidelines, it seems to me you're just working in opposition to what our opinions have said which is that the guidelines are advisory. And they're not mandatory.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, you're - - you're arguing hereby in a case where the departure was downward, but you're -- the principle you apply, you would apply for upward departures as well?",
  "Doesn't there get to be a constitutional problem where -- where the court which is establishing these -- these ranges that you want has held, after a series of decisions, that basically you cannot get 30 percent over -- over the guideline range unless particular facts exist? And it has specified those -- those facts in prior decisions. At that point, in order to go 30, you know, 30 percent above the guidelines, that fact becomes necessary for the conviction and -- or for the sentence, and, therefore, you would need the jury to find it.",
  "That's what common law adjudication always amounts to. By trial and error, one case, the next case, you eventually end up knowing what is necessary in order to give 30 -- 30 percent over. Unless you're accomplishing that, I don't know what you're accomplishing.",
  "He said this fact is okay. You can go 30 percent above with this fact. So then in the next case, the district judge says, I find that this fact exists and therefore you get 30 percent above the max, and the court of appeals affirms, but the jury has never found that fact.",
  "It left open -- it left open case-by-case adjudication. It left -- application review. And I'm saying that in the application review of that case, you'd have to say you needed a jury finding.",
  "Where -- so what?",
  "Is there some rule up there that says every criminal statute has to cover as much as possible?",
  "I think it -- I think it much more remarkable than that, more extraordinary than that, that Congress would want to make all -- all betting operations like this a violation automatically of two criminal statutes.",
  "I find that sort of, you know, very strange.",
  "Oh well, I mean -- come on. Nobody -- nobody runs a gambling operation without paying off the winners. It's not going to last very long.",
  "To make the paying off of the winners a separate crime from running the gambling operation seems to me quite extraordinary.",
  "But even if - -",
  "It will solve a lot them. And unless you're willing to come in and say, yes, do it to us, give us a narrower definition of concealment and a narrower definition of what's a transaction, but you're not willing to do that. You're going to stretch that as broadly as you can.",
  "You might well reject it if you're going to have a narrow definition of proceeds. I mean, that rejection was connected with its acceptance of a narrow definition of proceeds. And if you're asking us to obliterate the latter, I don't know why it isn't reasonable to send it back to the Seventh Circuit and say, well, you still said the same thing if you came out differently on the proceeds question.",
  "I find that extraordinary. You really come in and say yeah, two crimes, assume Congress meant ordinary gambling crime to carry with it this other extraordinarily high penalty for the same activity that involves the gambling, but don't worry about it, we'll even it out in the sentencing. I mean -- that's no way to run a railroad.",
  "Straighten that out in the definition of the crime, rather than in the - -",
  "What continues? The business has to continue. You are not engaging in a gambling business if you're not paying off the winners. That's all. That's not a good decent honest gambling business.",
  "Because gambling under the definition has the three elements that do not include paying off the winners. That's what it all represents --",
  "Of course it is.",
  "So why are you urging us to create two problems, to drag along all of the problems that you object to with -- with interpreting proceeds to include simply covering your expenses? You acknowledge that the problems you point out would continue to exist if we accept your definition. On the other hand, I think you have to acknowledge that accepting your definition creates other problems of its own, such as the difficulty in every case of showing that an illegal operation made a profit, such as the difficulty of deciding what kind of criteria you use for determining what are the -- what are the ordinary and necessary expenses of a criminal enterprise. Why should we -- why should we choose to get the worst of both worlds? And why isn't the proper way to attack the difficulty to focus in on what constitutes a transaction and what constitutes concealment - - something other than the \"proceeds\" definition?",
  "Mr. Vare, you know, I'm - - I'm unwilling to decide the definition of transaction question in the present case because, frankly, I think that's a -- in itself, a very difficult question which we haven't had adequately argued. For example, while I believe, as I've indicated earlier, that paying off the winners is -- is an essential part of a gambling operation, I don't believe that paying off runners necessarily is. You can have a gambling operation without runners, can't you? You can - -",
  "You can -- you can view that as something beyond the mere -- the mere gambling crime. I don't -- I don't think you can view that paying off the winners is beyond the gambling crime, but I do think having a bunch of runners and paying off each of them is not necessarily part of gambling.",
  "Exactly.",
  "Not just proving that it's profitable; proving that the person laundering it knew that it was profits because that's part of the definition of the crime, that scienter. And how can you prove that the fellow knew that it was profits? He would very rarely know whether it was or wasn't. So he skips off scot-free free of the laundering crime.",
  "I mean what -- what's the total stage you look at? Suppose it's profitable 1 month and not the next month, and the loss the second month more than undoes the profits of the first month. Can you still prosecute them for the profits in the first month?",
  "One day they could pick then, they have one good day. And they could - -",
  "Why does it have to be the ordinary expense of that? I mean, let's assume the charge is murder, and I happen to use a hit man for the murder. That's proven and whatnot. Why -- you mean, that isn't part of the murder conviction, simply because I could have done it without a hit man, I could have done it myself?",
  "You think paying the hit man would be part of the murder transaction?",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "No, I understand.",
  "He wanted to kill his wife, right?",
  "The State has not allowed it. The State has required it, no?",
  "Although if we -- if we hold it unconstitutional for the State to require it, I suppose it would also be unconstitutional for the State merely to allow it, wouldn't it? So that this manner of selecting judges in any other State, if it has been voluntarily adopted by the party, would be unconstitutional?",
  "What if -- what if it were the parties that objected to this and not some individual who said, I'm not being given enough voice in the party? What if the parties said, we don't want to select our candidates this way? Is it clear that the State could impose it upon them?",
  "Well, the State can restrict that right if it wants to. The State can require the party to select its candidates by -- by primary.",
  "Or by convention.",
  "But if the State wants to do it by smoke -- if the party wants to do it by smoke-filled room, the State can say, if it wishes to say, you can't do it by smoke-filled room.",
  "Well, but that -- but that's not the issue here. The State and the party are in agreement.",
  "The State is not trying to coerce the party into doing something that it doesn't want to do.",
  "Have we -- have we imposed any such restrictions on our own, as opposed to merely upholding restrictions that were imposed by the State? That is to say, have we held that the Constitution itself imposes certain restrictions?",
  "Yes. I want a case where the State did not impose the restriction and it was up to us to decide whether the State could do that or not, but rather the State said the party can do whatever it wants, and we have disallowed what the party itself chose under no compulsion from the State - -",
  "-- on the basis of some constitutional principle apart from the Equal Protection Clause - -",
  "-- or the Thirteenth amendment.",
  "Well, the parties are not protesting in this case, are they?",
  "If and when that situation arises, I suppose we can -- we can decide it. But it's not here. The parties are totally happy with this and would do it on their own.",
  "In fact, it is probably likely the parties got this system adopted by the New York legislature.",
  "That's a general election case, isn't it?",
  "Mr. Schwarz -- I'm sorry, go ahead.",
  "The person wouldn't be opposed if he approached the boss and the boss said: Yeah. Boy, I really like you. That person would automatically not be a rebel. He'd be part of the establishment.",
  "Of course not. You're really arguing against the whole purpose this scheme, which is not to have judges popularly elected. And you're saying no, we want them popularly elected. The purpose of the scheme is to -- is to have the people elect delegates and have delegates use their good judgments as to who -- as to who the best judge would be. But you say, no, we want the people to have an input. I mean, it's contrary to the whole purpose of the scheme. Of course it works the way you say it does. It is designed to work that way. It's a basic judgment not to have judges popularly elected, and your objection amounts to saying no, judges ought to be popularly elected.",
  "You're not saying the State could compel that?",
  "You're saying that the State could permit it?",
  "Mr. Grossman, is there any reason why, in principle, the elements for a cause of action under 10b-5 have to be the same as the elements for a cause of action by the agency under 10(b)? I mean, we, we created this, this cause of action. It's not set forth in the statute, although other private causes of action are. If it's our creation, couldn't we sensibly limit it so that, for example, schemes can be attacked by the SEC, but schemes do not form the basis for private attorney general's actions? You need actual conveyance of a misrepresentation to the injured party. Is there any reason why we couldn't do that?",
  "Intended or known? I mean, I don't see -- what's in it for Scientific-Atlanta to defraud the shareholders? Is it enough that they just knew it would be used for that purpose?",
  "Well, when you say \"in furtherance of,\" you -- you import intent. They didn't care what Charter was going to do with it, but they pretty well knew that what Charter was going to do was to make its books look better. Would that be enough?",
  "That's what I thought your position was.",
  "Sure. After trial -- you know, after trial which causes your stock to tank, you may indeed be able to show that you didn't know it was going to be used for that purpose. I mean, that's what this is all about, isn't it, getting it -- getting it by the summary-judgment stage?",
  "What facts -- what has to be alleged short of -- on information and belief the defendant knew that -- that this information would appear on the balance sheets and be used to improve the status of the stock?",
  "But that's exactly the thing they told them to separate.",
  "What other reason?",
  "I understand what you're saying. It seems to me that when you say that they can't be connected, you're saying precisely, you can't be bartering the advertising revenue for the increased money that you're paying.",
  "But don't aiders and abettors have to have that purpose as well? What distinguishes -- what distinguishes the liability that you propose from aider and abettor liability?",
  "So any aiding-and-abetting through a deceptive act makes you a principal? Is that it? You can't be an aider and abettor by committing or enabling a deceptive act without becoming a principal?",
  "You cannot?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, but -- but if you do, or if you should have known, you are not an aider and abettor. You are automatically a principal.",
  "Is it fair to say that all aiders and abettors who commit deceptive acts are principals?",
  "What's the difference? What separates the two?",
  "Don't you need that to be an aider or abettor?",
  "If I'm entirely innocent, and I don't --",
  "You see, I really thought the difference was that the principal is the one who makes the deceptive representation and obtains money from it. The aider and abettor is the person who facilitates or enables that deceptive representation, which is what we have here.",
  "And you say if you facilitate knowingly and intentionally or even grossly negligently, you are not an aider and abettor, but you're a principal. I really don't understand what's the line between the two.",
  "Could you amend that to invest -- he could engage in a deceptive practice directed at investments?",
  "You think that you are either a principal or an aider and abettor?",
  "For the same act, I'm talking about -- for the same act.",
  "Excuse me. It wasn't contested in Smith?",
  "Excuse me. Go back over that.",
  "Why couldn't it have been said in Smith that -- that trading it for drugs was not the only way in which the offense could have been committed? Couldn't the same thing have been said in Smith?",
  "So the issue in Smith was weapon versus nonweapon, and that's not what you're arguing here?",
  "The issue here is use versus nonuse, active employment versus passive receipt?",
  "I think you are making his argument. I think you're -- you're too humble, the argument you're making.",
  "And, of course, you could say the same thing about Bailey, I suppose. You know, What was there in Bailey except -- what was the term, linguistic -- nothing but a linguistic decision.",
  "Bailey doesn't make any more sense either from a policy standpoint.",
  "We sometimes we rely on linguistics, don't we?",
  "And sometimes the words of the statute.",
  "It's enough to say we don't usually talk that way.",
  "That's the end of it. We don't talk that way. We don't say use a car when you buy a car.",
  "Why -- why wouldn't making a material misstatement in order to obtain a gun constitute a use of the gun -- as much as it, the receipt of the gun constitutes a use of the gun here? What's the difference between the two situations?",
  "Not if you believe Smith.",
  "Not if you believe Smith.",
  "Why? There's -- they refer to crimes in which there has been a receipt but there has also been a conveyance. Why do you focus on the receiver rather than the conveyer?",
  "What are they?",
  "Involved in -- that broadens that enormously, doesn't it?",
  "It could be -- it could have -- it is intended to be used, not necessarily. As -- as your opponent pointed out, this section does not focus on the individual. It focuses on the firearm, simply for -- for confiscation of the firearm. And, therefore, it suffices if either side intended it to be used. It doesn't have to be the recipient who intended it to be used even though it's a receipt crime. It was intended to be used by the other side. Wouldn't that make sense?",
  "What page is that?",
  "Maybe they were doubtful about whether the \"possession\" thing applies here. I don't know. Possesses a firearm in furtherance of the crime -- I mean, the crime has been completed by the time the -- the person who is receiving the gun has possession of it.",
  "It's hard to say it's in furtherance of the crime when the crime is over once he gets it. His possession is not in furtherance of the crime, it seems to me. It's the other person's possession that's in furtherance of the crime. He possesses it so he can turn it over, which is the crime. But I mean I'm just not all that sure that you have a hundred percent easy case on the possession point.",
  "That's not such an outrageous proposition. You'd certainly acknowledge that the President and the Senate could not enter into a treaty that required the States to do something that was unconstitutional.",
  "So there would be the situation that presents the shocking situation you've just described. There is a treaty, but nonetheless it cannot be enforced domestically.",
  "It's self-enforcing. I thought you - -",
  "I thought you -- you think this treaty is self-enforcing. You don't really need the President's order here.",
  "This is not of a nature to be enforced in a judicial proceeding in Texas. Texas has procedural rules that disable the Texas court from complying with the ICJ judgment here. Are you telling me that the ICJ judgment empowers either Federal or State courts to do things which -- which their laws do not permit them to do?",
  "And -- and do you know of any other Federal law that -- that interferes in the - - in the procedures of State criminal courts, directs them as to what -- what procedures they have to have?",
  "Really?",
  "Where? I don't know what you're talking about unless you're talking about constitutional requirements. Of course, those are binding on the States. But you're saying that the Federal Government can prescribe State court procedures and authorize State courts to do things which -- which the State government does not authorize them to do?",
  "You don't agree with the last statement.",
  "We would have no - - according to you, we would have no obligation to enforce this judgment but for the President's action?",
  "We could decide to go back, too. But would we have any authority to do it?",
  "Wait a minute. In order to get it to the Security Council, you have to take some affirmative action not to comply? It's just not enough simply not to comply?",
  "I thought that was tte point of Justice Ginsburg's comment, that there had been no decision not to comply. Don't you need an affirmative decision to comply?",
  "I know you agree, but it depends on whether it's up to the President to make that call. Usually when we have treaties that are not self- enforcing the judgment of whether that international law obligation shall be made domestic law is a judgment for the Congress. Congress passes a law to enforce the treaty, and you're telling us that, well, we don't need the Congress; the President can make a domestic law by writing a memo to his attorney general.",
  "They were not parties to it. What do you mean, \"covered by the judgment?\" Is this some -- some new kind of new kind of jurisdiction? If you're named in a suit by somebody else, you somehow acquire rights under that suit? I don't know of any such principle.",
  "These people were not parties to the -- the countries were parties to the judgment.",
  "The President espousing the judgment -- Texas takes the position that this memorandum has -- has no legal effect; it's a memorandum from the President to the -- to his attorney general. It's not a directive to the States. In fact, it even refers to pursuant to the principles of comity, which suggests, you know, do it if you want to be cooperative, don't do it if you don't want to be cooperative. What is your response to that? And would it be enough if the President simply wrote a memorandum to himself saying that, I think this is the way that the - - that the judgment of the ICJ should be enforced? He doesn't have to tell Texas. He can just tell his attorney general?",
  "It just means we agree that the case can go before the court.",
  "And we will be a party before the court. Isn't there some doubt whether the - - the Senate and the President, together, can -- can take away from this Court the power and responsibility to decide what the treaty obligations of the United States are?",
  "Isn't there some problem there?",
  "Once again, there is a constitutional problem, is there not, if they are automatically enforceable?",
  "That is conferring upon the ICJ the responsibility to decide the meaning of a United States treaty which is United States law.",
  "I'm rather jealous of that power.",
  "I think it belongs in this Court. And when you have a non-self-executing treaty, there is no problem. It becomes U.S. law when the Senate and the House pass a law which the president -- it doesn't become U.S. law because the President writes a memorandum to his Attorney General, but it does become U.S. law when a law is enacted.",
  "That solves the constitutional problem, but in the situation we're talking about here, I don't know on what basis we can allow some international court to decide what is the responsibility of this Court, which is the meaning of the United States law.",
  "A lot of people think that's exactly right, that really we expanded Federal habeas jurisdiction quite improperly. But it happens every day, doesn't it?",
  "I think you misunderstood. I thought he was asking whether if it is -- assuming it is not self-executing, this Court can execute it.",
  "They mean it does not automatically become part of United States law.",
  "And it follows from that, that you have to change United States law?",
  "And it is not the function of this Court to change United States law.",
  "And he had lived in this country for how long?",
  "Put precisely, it would be making it Federal law and then applying it. If you assume it's not self-executing, somebody has to make it to domestic law. Now, Congress can obviously do it by passing a law. But you're saying the Court can do it, can make it dmestic law and then enforce it.",
  "Yes, yes, ys.",
  "What is the transaction - - what is the single transaction that you think brings your client within this language?",
  "What is the transaction, the guarantee?",
  "I'm not talking about what the rule is that was violated. It says \"who engaged in any transaction on or subject to the rules of such contract market.\" What is, in brief, \"the transaction\" you're relying upon?",
  "The transaction does not require two parties?",
  "You have a one-party transaction?",
  "Mr. Pincus, will you satisfy me on one point. I -- I understand your argument about what \"transaction\" means. But even if I accept that argument, explain to me again why \"or subject to the rules\" doesn't add anything?",
  "Why wouldn't it have been enough to just say \"transactions on\" if that was their meaning? Why did -- did they - -",
  "Counsel, what do you do about the later -- the later statute that makes an exception to the exception?",
  "I mean it clearly, the exception to the exception says that -- that the exception is applicable to any claim based on injury or loss of goods or merchandise, if among other requirements, the property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture under any provision of Federal law providing for the forfeiture of property. Now that's more than customs and tax -- any provision of Federal law.",
  "Why do you need that exception to the exception if the exception doesn't cover anything except customs and tax in the first place?",
  "They didn't -- they didn't need that if indeed it covered all seizures by -- by customs and tax officers and nobody else. If that's all it -- it covered, what -- you know, this doesn't achieve anything. The purpose of under any provision of Federal law. It seems to me that that envisions seizure under laws other than tax and customs. Now you're saying there is one, one such law that tax and customs officers sometimes use?",
  "What work does it do? What work under your interpretation does that later provision do, if property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture under any provision of Federal law providing for the forfeiture of property?",
  "Right.",
  "It's also - -",
  "It's also not entirely clear what -- whether it's a tail or not. It depends on what the dog is. If you can -- if you were trying to identify the most common instances, especially at the time this provision was enacted, the most common instances in which property was detained by the government, I mean you know, later -- later forfeiture provisions are numerous, but at that time I think they were relatively few. I think the dog would have been - - would have been customs and excise officers. And the \"or other officers\" would have picked up probably very little real -- real instances of property detention.",
  "Do the members of Congress who voted on this language, when it was presented to them, did they even know who Judge Holtzoff was?",
  "Did he testify to this effect before one of the committees?",
  "15 years before it was passed, right?",
  "There are two \"anys\" here. I'm not sure that - -",
  "Any other. So it says any goods by any officer of customs or excise, or if it just had said \"other law enforcement officer,\" you might - - you might disregard the force of any because it was way back there.",
  "But if they repeat \"or any other law enforcement\" - -",
  "Mr. Coad, how are -- how are civil rights which have been taken away typically restored? What is -- what is the process for restoring them? Just if you don't commit another offense within a certain number of years?",
  "Well, you -- you can say, however, that -- that in the restoring situation, there is at least a greater individuation of the -- of the State's determination of the -- the trustworthiness of the individual to be -- to be trusted with arms. That is to say well, this person has not committed an offense within so many years. Or maybe in some States, it may be an individual determination. That's why I asked you the question. Is it ever one by one, you apply to have them restored?",
  "Well, I mean, that's - - that's a totally different thing from just a gross determination by a State that everybody who commits this crime does not lose -- does not lose firearm rights. I think it's -- it's -- there's a greater degree of assurance when you're dealing with those States that -- that have some degree of individuation. At least this is an individual who hasn't committed an offense for so many years. Or in those States where you have to apply personally, I think they're different situations.",
  "But a misdemeanor? I see.",
  "Are you sure about that? (33) applies to a number of different crimes, it seems to me, within every State. Are you sure that in none of those crimes the civil rights are not taken away for some of them, but are taken away for others?",
  "But does it make much sense, as -- as Justice Ginsburg suggests, to read (a)(20)(B) as covering almost nothing? I mean, you know, why go to the trouble of putting in that provision if it's only going to make a difference in those -- in those very few States where - - well - -",
  "Can we rewrite statutes like that? Because, gee, look at this statute. Congress didn't think about this, and it makes a really bad result here. So we're going to add this -- this new -- I don't think that that's how we operate.",
  "It's not that absurd if Congress did the same thing in (a)(33).",
  "What court - -",
  "What court of appeals was that? I didn't get that.",
  "Not murderers, I assume?",
  "No, that's - -",
  "What if - -",
  "What if you call up your neighbor and say God, I got this disgusting child porn in the mail?",
  "Of course, you have a problem not just with the presenting, not just with the pandering of it. You have a problem with the mere possession of it. You have to find some exception for that anyway. You have to find some as- applied challenge exception for the mere possession of it, even if you don't pander it.",
  "Do we use a seven year old for the objective requirement?",
  "We would use a - -",
  "-- reasonable adult, I had thought.",
  "Or just good honest liars, right? I had thought that the purpose of the First Amendment was to protect speech that had some value, and that the reason obscenity is excluded entirely from First Amendment protection is that it has no redeeming social value. What social value do you find in being able to lie about the content of what you're offering to somebody else? You say somehow if you're lying about it, oh, well, then the First Amendment protects that. I would think if you're lying about it, it is clearer than ever the First Amendment doesn't protect it. There is no social value in protecting lies.",
  "But it depends on what they're lying about. If they're lying about the value of what they're selling, you know, it's fraud.",
  "Tell me what social value are we protecting here, by protecting the lie about whether this thing that really isn't child pornography is? What -- why would we want to protect that?",
  "Are you complaining about the degree of the penalty?",
  "You seem to think we are punishing the lying. I don't read the statute as punishing the lying.",
  "You'd be punished even if it were true. What is being punished is the pandering. You are the one that's bringing in the lying example. You say, my goodness, even if the pandering is a lie, pandering is pandering. And I don't see why there is some special protection against pandering when in addition to pandering, you're lying. Maybe you ought to get extra penalty.",
  "But, in fact, the statute does not provide extra penalty. It just provides a penalty for pandering. And I don't know why it's a good defense to that to say, oh, I was actually lying. I mean - -",
  "All of those verbs only become pandering when they are attached to explicit sexual material. When you promote explicit sex, you are pandering. I mean, the word pandering does have a sexual connotation. I -- I think -- I had thought it was accepted that we have here a statute that's directed against pandering.",
  "Why would it lessen? I assume whatever you put in an appendix, saying all these other situations that are not before us are not covered. Isn't that the most blatant dictum? But -- but -- and, of course, we're not bound in later cases by our dicta. But come to think of it, I guess the whole doctrine of overbreadth rests upon dictum, doesn't it? It -- it rests upon our determination in this case, which involves somebody who undoubtedly was selling child porn, and a horrible kind of child porn -- we say in this case, oh, we can -- we can contemplate other cases, where we would not hold the person guilty. That is all dictum, too, isn't it? So I guess the whole doctrine is -- is based on dictum. So we may as well put it in all an appendix. Let's put our dictum in an appendix. I agree.",
  "And you think that our holding in Teague was that it did, but we're not going to let you out of jail?",
  "You think that's really what we said in Teague, that even though your constitutional rights were violated, we're going to foreclose the remedy of habeas corpus? I -- I find it difficult to believe that that -- you know, any responsible court could make such a determination.",
  "And I think it is - -",
  "Is it not a substantive determination of Federal law when you say that this constitutional change that we're making in this case or that we have made in a past case is not retroactive? That means there was no constitutional violation in the past prior to the announcement of this case, and what the State -- what you want the State court to be able to say is yes, there is a Federal constitutional violation for which we're going to give a remedy in habeas.",
  "I think that's exactly what Crawford means, and I think that's exactly what happened. That's what it means, whether it's a new rule. What does a new rule mean? It means it didn't used to be the rule, but it is the rule after this case. Now, you can argue, and there are many originalists who would agree with you, that there shouldn't be such a thing as a new rule, but once you've -- once you've agreed that there can be new rules, if this Court says this is a new rule, we acknowledge it wasn't the rule before, but it's new, it will not have retroactive effect, it seems to me that the State would be contradicting that ruling by saying oh, in our view the law used to be exactly what you say it newly is.",
  "My position is we have asserted all that power in the world.",
  "Mr. Butler, let me -- this is a habeas case, but I assume the same issue could come up in a -- in a direct appeal to the State Supreme Court. Is it your position that in a direct appeal, the State can determine to be retroactive constitutional rights that we have said are not retroactive, on direct appeal, now, not habeas?",
  "If it bases its decision on the Federal Constitution, and we have said that this Federal constitutional rule is not retroactive, what - - what do they say on a direct appeal?",
  "And my next question is going to be whatever they say, when it comes up to us, what do we do?",
  "My case was not in the pipeline. The prosecution began after our new decision. Okay? And it comes up to the State Supreme Court. Can the State Supreme Court, despite the fact that we've said the decision is not retroactive, make it retroactive? And your answer is yes?",
  "Habeas or not?",
  "That always assumes that that's a remedial question, and that the question is not was the Constitution violated at the time this act occurred. That -- if that's the question, then you acknowledge that the State can't change the situation.",
  "I assume that the State executive can do that with respect to any Federal law that it's authorized to implement, simply choose not to, couldn't it? That's prosecutorial discretion.",
  "Then do you think the State is free to decide how and when and whether it will, quote, apply? I mean, simply to separate the law from the application of the law seems to me no answer at all. Is there any other area where you say well, yes, there was a Supreme Court decision; but whether to apply that decision is up to the State?",
  "Yes, that's correct. You have to say that's correct.",
  "But I think you can also explain that the reason it's correct is the Court probably would have liked to say yes, we're making up a new rule; the Constitution didn't use to say this; and this rule will apply from now on to all actions taken by individuals from now on. But then, you know, Justice Harlan says my goodness, you're going to give relief to this individual and not give relief to other individuals who are making the same claim and already have cases pending? You have to treat them equally. So we will make an equitable exception for that. But basically, the existence of that exception does not prove that the Court was not purporting to make a substantive rule. There's an exception to the application of that substantive rule for pending cases, which is totally understandable.",
  "I'm really glad to hear that.",
  "Don't we call it a new rule in Teague?",
  "You are saying metaphysically this Court has no power to enunciate new constitutional rules metaphysically, but we have done so, and Teague is full of references to new rules. \"We therefore hold that implicit in the retroactivity approach we adopt today is the principle that habeas corpus cannot be used as vehicle to create new constitutional rules of criminal procedure unless those rules would be applied retroactively to all defendants.\" The opinion is full of new rules. So -- so, you know, we have violated metaphysics already. Having violated it, in adopting new constitutional rules, why should it be any surprise that we also violated it in the application of those rules? There should be no surprise at all. Don't get hung up on metaphysics, Mr. Turner.",
  "You wouldn't want to say that, Mr. Turner, because that would place you in the position of saying what we are telling people in these Teague cases is oh, yes, the Constitution was violated, but we don't want to hear about it. I mean that's the alternative, to acknowledge that the Constitution is violated in all of these Teague cases, some of them being capital cases, and we nonetheless say well, too bad, it's on habeas. I'd like to think that's not what we're doing, that what we're saying is, this is a new constitutional rule, there was no constitutional violation before, and that's why we're letting it stand.",
  "I suppose there are a lot of valuation cases under the Takings Clause, aren't there?",
  "Is there a standard Federal rule for how you evaluate - -",
  "Mr. Phillips, could I come back to this question of whether or not there's going to be a uniform Federal rule or not. When the district court makes this finding of what the true market value is that's a finding of fact, I assume.",
  "And it would be reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard by the court of appeals?",
  "And if there were various methodologies that were possible and this was one of the ones that was ballpark at least reasonable, would the court of appeals have any basis for reversing the, how could you say it's - -",
  "I'm not sure what his question is. I think he is talking about reviewing the district court's judgment on that basis.",
  "Even if you don't agree with Justice Souter's test for the district court review of the State, might you agree with it as applied to the court of appeals review of the district court's job?",
  "Well, are you going to answer my question, yes or no?",
  "I didn't ask whether it was different. I asked whether a reasonable basis for plain error -- for clearly erroneous review, by the court of appeals, begins with assessing whether the methodology used by the district court is reasonable.",
  "Well, a combination of methodologies. I'm talking about -- when I say methodology, I mean even if it uses a combination of five different ones, okay.",
  "Is it reasonable? How do you propose to have the court of appeals review the district court's selection of methodologies?",
  "-- were reasonable? Do they have to have been the very best?",
  "Is it clearly erroneous if it may not be the very best, but it's ballpark and there is disagreement as to what the very best would be?",
  "It seems to be what it says though, isn't it?",
  "What's the language? What's the crucial language?",
  "No, it doesn't require - - what it say the district court is supposed to find?",
  "It's supposed to find the true market value of the railroads. It doesn't seem to me fuzzy language. District court is to find true market value.",
  "It's a very strange way of saying the district judge is to -- is to ask whether the State has used one of a number of reasonable methods of determining the market value. To say, go find the true market value is a very strange way of saying that, and that's what you, that's what you're saying it means.",
  "I was expecting you to say, that what is truth?",
  "The trouble is you can't find a -- it is a line, but it's not a line you can derive from true market value. I mean, you can do it, but what in the statute suggests that that's what you should do?",
  "No, I don't think they're not going to get that from this Court, any more than they could get it from the Court of Appeals. All the Court of Appeals can say, it seems to me, is that the methodology that the district court used was not clearly erroneous. I think another district court in a later year could probably use a different methodology, which would again be affirmed by the Court of Appeals because it was not clearly erroneous. We're not -- I don't think either the Court of Appeals or this Court is placing any stamp on a particular methodology.",
  "Maybe they did, but they're not going to get it here.",
  "This State appraiser as I understand it had never done an appraisal before of - - of this magnitude, right?",
  "I'm looking for the footnote, but I -- I was, I was impressed by what seemed to me the -- the vast difference in -- in qualifications and experience of the -- of the State appraiser and of the expert who was brought in by the railroads at the trial. And it seemed to me quite absurd to say we have to defer to -- to this novice in the field, and -- and not look at the -- at the testimony of -- of someone who has done a lot of it before.",
  "Did you have a response - - did you have a response to that footnote? I didn't - -",
  "I'm sorry. I must have skipped that.",
  "A little footnote battle here, right?",
  "Of yours?",
  "And that's what you have here. I've looked -- I've looked at your footnote and I see that indeed Mr. Dickerson did have over 30 years experience including well over a thousand valuations - - performed under the unit rule; performed under one method of evaluation, right?",
  "But the whole issue here is that that method of valuation, however expert he is at it, is not proper here. It doesn't work. That there are other ones that should have been brought to bear.",
  "Was one of the ones, yes; but that's not the only one. That's the only one he is an expert in.",
  "And it's different methodologies under the unit rule. He has used -- he has used different methodologies under - -",
  "Mr. Calvert, can you tell me how this thing works, or how it may work in the future? Does the State just whip up a number and lay it on the railroad, or -- or, in fact, is there some discussion each year between the railroad's experts and the -- and the State's experts as to what the right number should be?",
  "Okay. So there is some give-and-take discussion before the State comes down firmly and says: Cough up the money?",
  "Okay.",
  "Since we are talking here about the negative Commerce Clause, we really should say that's the reason the Commerce Clause doesn't exist.",
  "Did the prior statutes have a different structure?",
  "We've held this thing is jurisdictional for a long time. Did the prior statutes under which we made those holdings have a different structure?",
  "It seems to me all of those factors are a lot more subtle than the mere fact that we have said that this is jurisdictional for years and years, it and its predecessor. Why -- why isn't that at least as persuasive as the -- as the fragile attachments you're -- you're discussing here or even as the -- as the, you know, the -- even if the statute said that it's jurisdictional, we've said in our opinions that to say it's jurisdictional doesn't mean that it's jurisdictional necessarily. So I suppose we could say the same about the statute, couldn't we?",
  "It didn't say that. You're saying that.",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Haynes, isn't it less radical and, indeed, more in accord with the language of Irwin to -- to say that what Irwin overruled was not the whole principle that this statute of limitation is -- is -- and others that relate to sovereign immunity, is jurisdictional, but rather the much more limited rule that -- that statutes of limitations which are jurisdictional are not subject to equitable tolling? That's a much more limited point, and -- and the language of Irwin is a waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed once Congress has made such a -- once Congress has made such a waiver, we think that making the rule of equitable tolling applicable to suits against the government in the same way that it is applicable to private suits amounts to little, if any - - little, if any -- broadening of the congressional waiver. I don't think one can say that if you expand the principle to cover the whole -- the whole matter of whether it's jurisdiction. So why not read Irwin more moderately to -- to -- if we have to overrule one of two things, the whole doctrine of the jurisdictional nature of statutes of limitations in sovereign immunity cases and the other is simply, oh, yes, there is sovereign immunity, but can there be equitable tolling, why shouldn't we adopt the more limited one?",
  "You can usually count on the government to file the canned sovereign immunity brief.",
  "I don't understand that. I mean, that -- that seems to me a very strange argument. You say since -- since the EEOC must give notice when a charge is filed, if it doesn't give notice, no charge has been filed. That doesn't make sense. I mean, it's just like saying, you know, you have a civil rule, a rule of civil procedure, that says, you know, after a complaint has been filed there shall be an answer within 60 days. And if no answer is filed, no complaint has been filed?",
  "I mean, it just doesn't track.",
  "So give me another one that will enable me to rule in your favor?",
  "All right. Now, does - - does the person who's filed a proper charge know whether notice has been given or not? Is a copy of the notice always given to the filer.",
  "It said it wasn't a charge, didn't it? Didn't it say that it's not a charge?",
  "Precharge counseling.",
  "Doesn't that eliminate the whole purpose of the -- of the preliminary document, to weed out those charges that relate to employment in France?",
  "It will -- it will be a charge even if it's in France?",
  "I think that's right. I think what it boils down to is it'll be a charge if we decide to give notice, and it won't be a charge if we don't decide to give notice.",
  "Which is very nice for the EEOC, but not - -",
  "Intake questionnaire.",
  "Excuse me. I thought you said you were deprived of something else. I mean, the statute provides for a conciliation process in which you can talk to the employee and say, you know, what happened? And you may well be able to satisfy the employee with -- before -- before she lawyers up. I think it's a big disadvantage to -- to have no contact with the employee until there's a lawyer on the other side, and you can't talk to her confidentially; you can't make a conciliation notice. I think that's a considerable disadvantage, and it's - - it's a situation that the statute did not envision.",
  "Well, as a practical matter, you can't conciliate after suit anyway. You can negotiate with the lawyer - -",
  "-- on the other side.",
  "Well, what is your test? When is it a charge?",
  "And don't tell me when notice is given.",
  "My goodness. It's like saying there's no complaint until an answer is filed.",
  "It's just not true.",
  "Yes, only because I'm sane.",
  "But there can't be equitable tolling unless she has really filed a charge. So sooner or later -- you cannot run away from it - - you're going to have to give us a definition of what a charge is.",
  "You're only going to give her equitable tolling if in fact she's, she's filed a charge. And you don't give me any -- unless you want to fall back on the manifest destiny rule or - -",
  "Is this after the real charge was filed or what everybody concedes - -",
  "The charge form.",
  "But suit was pending at that time.",
  "That's pretty risky.",
  "Answer my question. Was suit already filed at that point?",
  "Yes.",
  "Wait. I'm sorry. 247 during that whole period?",
  "That's the only number of mistakes they have made; is that what you're saying?",
  "I'm astounded if that's the only number of mistakes they made, from 19 - -",
  "Oh, with respect to FedEx.",
  "Oh.",
  "What's -- what's wrong with this? Why don't I -- I mean, I do believe that the thing either is a charge or isn't a charge before the EEOC decides whether it's going to give notice or not. It either is or isn't. Now, what about this: It is a charge if it reasonably appears to be a charge, or if you want to say \"manifest intent,\" that's okay, too. Now, if you signed a document which -- which says that it is a prefiling document and the purpose is to discuss a future charge, it seems to me you know, or ought to know, that this is not a charge. And we can't run the system for people who are either illiterate or don't even have friends who are literate. We can't run a system that way. So I look at this, and I say this is not a charge.",
  "Now, if the EEOC chooses to give notice, then I guess you could say one that's close to the boundary line becomes a charge retroactively, and there is -- there is no harm done. You can have the counseling, and so forth. But when you come in with something that doesn't look like a charge, it seems to me if there is no notice given and you get into the situation that is here where the company has been deprived of the conciliation opportunity, deprived of the opportunity to preserve evidence and whatnot, it seems to me the fault should lie on your client, because she filed something that any reasonable person should know is not a charge.",
  "Whatever it was, this thing says it's a precharge document.",
  "Why do you think -- why do you think they must have lost it? Why did you think they must have lost it: Because she hadn't been given a number?",
  "Even if they treat it as a charge, they don't docket it?",
  "I really think the problem here is the EEOC, rather than anybody else.",
  "It does, indeed, have this form which says -- which says that its purpose - - information provided on this form will be used by Commission employees to determine the existence of the facts relevant to a decision as to whether the Commission has jurisdiction and to provide such precharge filing counseling, blah, blah, blah. All of that, however, is contained as part of the Privacy Act statement.",
  "And if the filer is not interested in keeping any of it confidential, I wouldn't even read the Privacy Act.",
  "Well, what kind of an agency is this?",
  "Where does that appear? Where does that appear?",
  "In its very definition of a \"charge,\" it says a charge shall be in writing and shall name the prospective respondent and shall generally - - shall generally allege the discriminatory acts. That's what it must contain.",
  "It doesn't say that anything that contains that is a charge.",
  "I could write out something that contains all three of those things. Would that be a charge?",
  "All right. Let's try something else.",
  "Well, then, all intake questionnaires are a charge, because they all contain that. I mean that definition is simply inconsistent with the -- with the agency's assertion that it has something called an intake questionnaire which does not constitute a charge unless -- I don't know -- unless there's manifest whatever it is. That's inconsistent because all of those intake questionnaires contain all of that information - -",
  "-- set forth in 26.3.",
  "Mr. Heytens, let me tell you going in that my -- my main concern in this case, however the decision comes out, is to do something that will require the EEOC to get its act in order, because this is nonsense: These regulations that are contradicted by forms; this failure to give notice, but it's okay because it's a charge anyway. This whole situation can be traceable back to the agency, and I -- whoever ends up bearing the burden of it, it's the agency's fault, and this scheme has to be revised.",
  "Excuse me.",
  "That's within 10 days of the charge, but that assumes, it seems to me, what's to be proven. I mean what is the charge?",
  "If -- if the prefiling, the intake thing, is not a charge, there is no problem.",
  "Can you not make that not a charge by saying in bold letters on the top: This is not a charge. If you want a charge, ask for Form 5?",
  "Why do the courts have to struggle with this when the agency could put in bold letters at the top: This is a charge or this is not a charge? Why do Federal district judges have to inquire into manifest intent from now until doomsday?",
  "Where is that in CFR?",
  "Oh, okay.",
  "Mr. Heytens, what's your solution for the situation where the EEOC treats it as a charge, but doesn't give notice, which is what has happened here? How do you think that should play out?",
  "That's right.",
  "How do we fix it? You haven't gotten notice, you haven't had a chance to conciliate -- how do we fix it?",
  "Indeed, are there not such things as nonbinding arbitration's?",
  "Which in effect say that when we're done the district court will do it as an original matter.",
  "Excuse me. I'm just not following this discussion. Does it assume that you can bring an action on the contract and just bypass the provision of the contract which says there will be arbitration? How can you do that? You -- you don't assert you can do that?",
  "You clearly can't do that.",
  "So somebody has to decide on this arbitration provision.",
  "But this -- but this one isn't, and if we say that you lose under the Federal Arbitration Act, is it open to the State court to say, well, that's what the Federal Arbitration Act says, but we handle arbitration differently?",
  "I think if you lose on the arbitration here, you've got to lose on the arbitration before State court.",
  "I mean you don't have to admit that. That's - -",
  "That is, indeed, the issue. What we're arguing about here is whether 9 and 10 are simply default rules that apply where the parties have not otherwise specified. That's -- and that's, arguably, what the New York law and the Illinois -- I - - I don't know that any of those cases cited by the other side involved cases where the Illinois rule or the New York rule was applied in the teeth of an arbitration agreement that said something differently.",
  "In other words, I think both the Illinois rule and the New York rule were default rules.",
  "And you're arguing that this is the default rule?",
  "What do you do about the fact that our opinions have said that there is another ground under 10, which is manifest miscarriage of justice? That's not listed there.",
  "Why -- why did we go -- go to the trouble of expressing it differently?",
  "Why not just say Section 4?",
  "What would happen in situations like this? Suppose we agree with you; and we say, oh, yes, both of the parties agreed as part of this contract: I don't want to let these arbitrators decide the law. If they get the law wrong, we want -- we want the courts to decide the law. That's the deal. And then you're going to say, oh, that portion of the contract is no good.",
  "Is there no such thing as -- as failure of the contract for a misunderstanding of the law?",
  "You think -- you think the State can enforce an arbitration award that would not be enforceable under the FAA?",
  "Assume we agree with you that this is a quick and dirty way to get arbitration agreements enforced if you want to bring it within 9 and 10, and if you don't, you're free not to; you can go to the State courts. Why can't he still go to the State courts? You say this is going to terminate the litigation. Is this going to be res judicata on anything? All it's going to say is the Federal courts have no jurisdiction over this. It's not under 9 and 10. You're going to run off to State court. You're going to protract the litigation rather than bring it to a quick end.",
  "I don't understand that.",
  "But -- but the old Illinois and the old New York rules, you don't have any cases which say -- which establish that those rules were not just default rules, but you -- but you were not allowed to depart from them.",
  "You don't -- you don't have any case that holds that?",
  "You don't have any case that holds that.",
  "Why couldn't you limit it reasonably by saying the parties can agree to anything? We would only have to say at least, the parties can at least agree to anything that the court would be able to do if this had been brought as an action in the court, rather than initially as an arbitration.",
  "Which means the court would decide the questions of law.",
  "I understand, but that would be a limit. You say it's limitless. It doesn't have to be limitless.",
  "Remind me why Section 9 doesn't get you there -- because of the \"if\" clause.",
  "If the parties in their agreement have agreed that a judgment of a court shall be entered upon the award made pursuant to -- but they have agreed to that, haven't they?",
  "The question is simply - -",
  "Why is, why is that condition excluded from the \"if\" clause, but all of the other conditions that are set forth in 10 are not excluded from the \"if\" clause? I mean, it seems to me the \"if\" clause must embrace any conditions.",
  "What are the code numbers of those? I really get confused with you people who work with ERISA all the time -- can refer, you know Section 3 of ERISA. I use the code. What -- what code sections are you talking about?",
  "Thank you.",
  "But that wasn't in the record.",
  "It is in the record.",
  "That's fine, so why doesn't he proceed first under (a)(1)(B), against the plan?",
  "Because the plan owes him this money. And if the plan turns around and says well, you know the fiduciary didn't invest your funds the way it was supposed to, the plan still owes him the money, doesn't it?",
  "I'm talking about (a)(1)(B).",
  "Well, there is -- there is this to suggest that only -- only that manner of proceeding preserves the structure of -- of the legislation which is that you're supposed to first apply to the plan and exhaust your remedies there before you come into court; and interpreting it that way would preserve that -- that exhaustion requirement. You have to apply to the plan first, and if you establish that the plan owes you money, then it's a loss to the plan and you can sue in court.",
  "Let me come back to your earlier point that the second requirement of (a)(2) - - it's actually a requirement of 1109 - -",
  "-- is not met. And that is -- that is to -- to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach. In these welfare plans, if you sue the plan, claiming some welfare benefits that haven't been provided, wouldn't the plan have to provide those benefits?",
  "And that would be a loss to the plan.",
  "Right.",
  "I have an entitlement to certain -- certain welfare payments.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "It does if you sue the plan and require the plan to pay what the plan has committed to pay, whereupon the plan would have a right of action against the fiduciary, I assume, for the fiduciary's failure to do what he was supposed to.",
  "Well, but that would preserve the necessity of going through the exhaustion requirement first. You apply to the plan and say the plan owes me this cancer treatment, and the plan says \"yes, we do\" or \"no, we don't.\" If it says \"yes, we do,\" it's liable to you and then the plan can -- can recover over against the trustee.",
  "Well, it isn't just if the money is payable to him today. It says, \"to enforce his rights under the terms or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\"",
  "And if there's no money in his account, it seems to me he could bring an action to clarify that even if there is no money in his account the plan owes him future benefits in that amount.",
  "Right.",
  "But the plan wouldn't necessarily pay out any money. What would happen is, after the administrative determination by the plan that it does owe the money, he would sue the plan for the money and the plan would implead the trustee who was responsible for this. It ends up the same way.",
  "What would happen if the trustee does not have the money? The trustee not only squandered your client's money; he squandered his own. He's just really in bad shape. He has no money to cough up. What happens to your client? Doesn't your client get that money from the plan anyway?",
  "By picking, as you put it, by picking the pockets of the other plan participants?",
  "What's the answer to it?",
  "They participated in the plan. It was a failure of the trustee for the plan. It seems to me the whole plan should be liable for it. I mean that's how I - -",
  "Mr. Roberts, Section (a), (a)(1)(B) - -",
  "Unlike Section (a)(2), which refers you to 1109, does not say who gets sued. Under 1109 it's clear who gets sued. It's the fiduciary who gets sued. I find it very curious that (a)(1)(B) just says a civil action may be brought to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plans or to clarify his right under the terms of the plan.",
  "I think the implication there is that the suit -- the suit is against the plan.",
  "Where?",
  "It may well. But I'm just talking right now of (a)(1)(B), and it would seem to me that the logical reading of that is that the suit is against the plan.",
  "Is that 1132 we are talking about?",
  "Of the United States Code.",
  "It's useful to have a code. It really is.",
  "Is it entirely clear that the plan itself does not have any money to pay this off unless it takes the money from other individual accounts? I thought one of the briefs said that -- that some plans have independent funds. I forget what sources they came from, but some slush fund that they could use for this purpose.",
  "It wasn't called a slush fund. I know that.",
  "You know I could understand your case if you said even if there were a hundred diamonds, each of them in an individual plan, there still is no loss to the plan until the plan itself has been held liable to make up for the loss. Up until that point, it's just a loss in each of the individual accounts. But you're not willing to say that. You say at some ineffable point it becomes a loss to the plan. I think there is a clear line between -- between saying there is no loss to the plan unless -- unless the plan is first adjudicated to be liable; then there is a loss to the plan.",
  "Prior to that it's just a loss to the individual account. That makes some sense. I mean, I can understand how that works. I can't understand how your system works. You're telling me it depends on how big the diamond is and -- and what kind of a breach it was. How can we write an opinion like that?",
  "What's done meanwhile? He came in right at the bottom and a week later, it had gone up 30 points.",
  "-- no remedy?",
  "Well, I don't -- I don't really see that line. I mean, let's -- let's take, you know, fixing the roof on a house that's in the trust. Aren't there distinctive trustee obligations with respect to preservation of property, just as there are with respect to preservation of financial assets?",
  "I think that's a very hard line to draw.",
  "I'm still - -",
  "I'm still trying to get back to my original question. I -- I would like to know what you think is not an expense that's distinctive to -- to a trust, other than fixing the roof, because you haven't persuaded me on that.",
  "I think fixing a roof is fixing a roof.",
  "Anything else?",
  "Isn't there a trustee obligation to pay all -- all expenses which if not paid will -- would cause a depletion of the assets?",
  "Can't you say that that's a trustee response -- I mean, if the criterion is he paid this money only to discharge an obligation as a trustee, it seems to me all of his expenses are in that category, with the possible exception of the S corporations you're talking about.",
  "Excuse me. I am not sure what you mean by \"non-grantor trusts.\" What is a \"non-grantor trust\"?",
  "Every trust has a grantor, I assume.",
  "So a \"non-grantor trust\" - -",
  "-- is a trust without any money.",
  "Why do you think that the only instances where the expense would not have occurred are those instances where it could not have occurred? That doesn't strike me as self-evident. I mean, I understand why you do it, so that can you have a nice clear line, which I am all for. But the line given by your colleague is just as clear. I don't know why I should accept yours when -- I mean, \"would\" just does not mean \"could.\" I mean, would have, could have, should have, it's -- they're different words.",
  "Give me a context where - - where -- other than this statute, where in common parlance people use \"would\" to mean \"could.\"",
  "No, I don't think it would mean that.",
  "Anything that could not be done of course would not be done. But that doesn't mean that the -- that the two words mean the same thing.",
  "It's true that one is included within the other, but they don't mean the same thing.",
  "What could not happen would not happen, of course. But it doesn't mean that -- the two concepts are not the same.",
  "Well, I have the same problem. You know, I -- it seems to me that it is entirely reasonable to say only a trustee can seek investment advice concerning what he should do to fulfill his responsibilities under the trust. Only a trustee can do that. A private individual might seek investment advice as to how he could maximize the income or -- or the growth of the funds that he has, but only -- only a trustee seeks advice as to how he can fulfill his responsibilities under the trust. And you could say that's distinctive. No individual would do that because he's not a trustee.",
  "It may -- it may well be the same advice, but in -- but in one case it is -- it is advice sought by and given to a trustee, a unique kind of advice. In -- in substance, it may turn out to be the same; but it's not the same advice you're giving to a private individual. You're saying here's the trust instrument and here are the objects to be achieved by the trust instrument and this is the -- the advice that will best do that. That doesn't happen with an individual.",
  "Can you really spice up advice that way? You ask the advisor, say, which - - what percentage of your advice was the advice that went to maximizing total return and what percentage went to this other thing? I mean, gee, I don't want to get courts into trying to figure that out, or private individuals or financial advisors in trying to figure that out. That's just a crazy way to run a tax system, it seems to me.",
  "But that's not all advice. That's just some of the advice, right?",
  "Now, what about the rest of it? How do you slice up, you know -- now, investment advisor, tell me what percentage of your advice went to the total return and what percentage went to other things. I don't think the investment advisor is going to be able to tell you.",
  "And whatever line you - - you pick, I guarantee you, trusts are going to break themselves up into mini-trusts that fall under the line. I mean people aren't stupid.",
  "I think \"would not have occurred\" is pretty good - -",
  "-- actually.",
  "The cost of the advice? What percentage of the costs incurred by a trust do you think the investment advice consists of? I mean, it seems to me the main thing a trustee ordinarily does, at least if he is a trustee of just cash, is to invest it. It seems to me his major expense must be getting financial advice, isn't that right?",
  "Well, imagine something else. Guess. What other, what other expense could even approximate that?",
  "And then my follow-up is, is there any -- I don't care about legislative history but some of my colleagues do. Is there any -- is there any indication that Congress thought it was, it was whacking trusts with this immense new tax with respect to their major expenditure? I expect it must be their major expenditure.",
  "The dog didn't bark.",
  "Well, you know a trust is sort of like a business. And deductions that an individual could not take if he were not in a business are perfectly okay for a business. And I don't know why trusts wouldn't be treated the same way. A trust has to get investment advice. True? When it's -- when it's an individual getting it, you wouldn't allow a deduction, but a trust is different. And unless Congress is clearer than this statute, I -- it seems to me that no individual would get trust investment advice. Only a trust can get trust investment advice.",
  "But the individual who wanted to maximize income, for example, if the trustee has to maximize income for some of the life beneficiaries or something, an individual could seek that same advice if he wanted that particular result from the investment, couldn't he?",
  "Oh, I didn't understand it to be that. I thought it was going to be, you know, the advisor had to figure out we need so much for the, for the remainder man and so much for the life beneficiaries and so forth. You don't think that would be enough?",
  "Mr. Rubin, is it the advice that's different or is it -- is it the inquiry that's different.",
  "Was it clear that New Jersey believed when it had authorized somebody to wharf out, that the person who wharfed out was not subject to New Jersey's environmental laws?",
  "The history doesn't show anything about that?",
  "So if --",
  "-- if it -- if it would have been subject to New Jersey's environmental laws, had New Jersey owned the bed of the river into which the wharf was extended, by parity of reasoning it seems to me the wharf would be subject to Delaware's environmental laws if Delaware owns the bed of the river.",
  "I don't --",
  "I have a more basic question. Assume -- assuming that the subaqueous land belongs to New Jersey and that New Jersey gives a private individual a right to wharf out into the Delaware, does that individual acquire ownership of the land under the water, assuming New Jersey owns the subaqueous land?",
  "But, normally, authority to wharf out doesn't convey the land with it; does it?",
  "Of the wharf.",
  "Of the wharf.",
  "Now, if -- if merely authority to wharf out would not even convey New Jersey's own land, how can you argue that, by reason of this Compact, it implicitly conveyed what is now Delaware's land?",
  "May continue to wharf out, but not continue to grant subaqueous land, which you say doesn't go with wharfing out.",
  "Could New Jersey -- could New Jersey prevent its use for liquified gas?",
  "Well -- but New Jersey had given this riparian owner the right to wharf out.",
  "So, obviously, the right to wharf out does not include the right to use the wharf for whatever you like, and the only thing we're arguing about is whether it is New Jersey or Delaware that can impose limitations. But that it is subject to limitation is, it seems to me, absolutely clear.",
  "Mr. Farr, could you tell me -- one thing in Article VII perplexes me. Why does it say that each State may \"make grants, leases, and conveyances of riparian lands and rights\"? \"Rights\" I can understand. But why would they say \"conveyances of riparian lands\"?",
  "I mean, obviously each State can -- riparian lands are within each State. Nobody questioned that at the time.",
  "So you say \"riparian lands\" means the land under the wharf? That's a strange use of \"riparian lands.\"",
  "Do you know of any other instance where people talk of riparian lands and they mean land extending under the water?",
  "That's your position, that \"lands\" means the lands under the water?",
  "He is asking about under this thing. Forget about the Commerce Clause. And it's obvious what the purpose of the hypothetical is. You're saying that to give you the right to wharf out does not mean that you can use the wharf for any purpose that's contrary to the police power prescriptions of Delaware. That is reasonable enough. Well, what if one of the police power prescriptions is you can't have a wharf? Now, you know, can you flatly contradict what Article VII says? And I really think you ought to give that one away.",
  "It was a wharf that didn't go beyond a low-water mark?",
  "What did they do, jump onto the land?",
  "So a wharf that is just ugly is okay. Your answer to Justice Souter is, Delaware can't say no more wharfs.",
  "If I understand you correctly, Mr. Frederick, you say that the -- that the police power of Delaware, despite Article VII, includes the power to require you to get a license before you can wharf out from the New Jersey Shore?",
  "In other words, Delaware can say no you can't wharf out unless, you get a license from us, despite Article VII.",
  "Of course it goes beyond the boundary. If it --",
  "If the other side of the boundary you don't need Article VII. New Jersey can allow anything to be done up to -- up to the low water mark, but you're saying that despite Article VII Delaware can say no, you cannot wharf out until you get a license from us?",
  "Oh --",
  "You've just read Article -- Article VII out of the Compact.",
  "It gives nothing to New Jersey.",
  "That's fine. They can do it.",
  "So long as it pays.",
  "Excuse me. New Jersey does not have full property in the shore of the Delaware?",
  "Well, then that's no basis for distinguishing. What else is there?",
  "I don't understand that. It's up to Maryland what's a concern. If Maryland doesn't want any water taken, why isn't that a valid exercise of Maryland's police power?",
  "You don't even acknowledge that. You deny even that. You have said that Delaware can prevent the wharfing out and say you can't wharf out unless you get a license from us.",
  "Wait. He is not done. As a matter of police power, however, they can do anything?",
  "It's a one-way pass. Why shouldn't it be a one-way veto?",
  "It doesn't give Delaware anything.",
  "Why does the Post Office have immunity from Maine laws? Really?",
  "You could kill people and all sorts of stuff. I mean - -",
  "But why aren't you just driving all this business to the Postal Service? I mean, you know, what have you accomplished? You'd drive FedEx out of business if they choose not to incur the additional expense. And so, you know, all these people just ship it through the Postal Service.",
  "You can't do it. I mean, they're exempt from Maine laws. Didn't you know that?",
  "Well, they - -",
  "Yes, but I think that the reason they make that concession is that they say you must prove knowledge, and they're -- they're not concerned about the -- about intentionally transgressing Maine's law. What they're concerned about is the additional steps that you require them to go through to make sure that there is no tobacco. So they're not really worried about it so long as you have a knowledge requirement.",
  "And that's why they're not worried about it, because it's hard to prove.",
  "Well, maybe because Congress wanted the regulatory void. Maybe Congress didn't want these things to be enforced by regulating the transporter, as opposed to regulating the shipper and the receiver. As far as the game regulation is concerned, isn't it the case that UPS won't carry any game now because of the -- because of your game regulations?",
  "It's too onerous.",
  "So you've sort of driven them out of the business.",
  "Well, as long as the buyer is not an interstate carrier, there is really no -- no problem of conflicting with Federal law.",
  "I assume that the purpose of the Federal law was not to enable services which would not otherwise be provided at all, but rather to enable services to be provided more economically, to reduce the cost, the cost of interstate transportation.",
  "Sure. Somebody would come in to occupy the void, but he would charge a heck of a lot more.",
  "Why wouldn't there would be a problem? I don't understand that. There would still be a problem with uniformity from State to State.",
  "Do you think if Maine did it for all products it would be okay? It's only they're doing it for tobacco that makes it bad?",
  "I didn't think so.",
  "Where does that appear in the materials? Do you remember where it is?",
  "But there's no text, though?",
  "Ms. Brinkmann, I'm fascinated by this New York settlement. You -- you say that -- that Maine can't do this. But you say if a bunch of States do it, and they twist the carriers' arms hard enough by threatening criminal penalties, so that the carriers say, okay, I give up; and then they agree to limit their transport, that's okay?",
  "Well, I mean you're speaking about the New York settlement as though that's hunky-dory.",
  "I'm not sure that if this -- if this Federal act means what it says, that that kind of settlement isn't the kind of thing the act did not want to happen.",
  "Voluntary under threat of criminal penalty.",
  "Well, that's -- that's nice. But what about the consumer? The act was not just for the convenience of the carriers. It was meant to -- to serve the convenience and the economic benefit of the consumer. I -- I expect a consumer might be able to challenge that -- that New York settlement. I'm surprised you accepted it as, well, you know, so long as the carrier coughs it up, it's okay.",
  "Before you get into that, do we have to hold -- assuming we agree with you -- do we have to hold that the knowing requirement of the first sentence is okay?",
  "-- even though the other provisions are not okay?",
  ": Okay. I have a lot of trouble with the knowing requirement.",
  "Fifty different States having a knowing requirement for a hundred different products -- I don't know that that complies with the Federal law.",
  "Times 50.",
  "Times 50, because 49 other States would have different requirements, and all those requirements might -- might cost only a penny to comply with. But you add them all up, and it is half a buck.",
  "Mr. Stern, I'd be interested in whether you have any response to the Government's point that, at least as far as 1555-D is concerned, that is a direct regulation of -- of the - - the shipper -- not the shipper, of the transporter. So that -- so that your point that this is not a regulation of -- of transport is simply -- is simply wrong as far as 1555-D is concerned. Do you acknowledge that?",
  "Okay.",
  "We don't really know, do we, what the district court's order was based on? Whether it was based on 401 or 403? Did the district court explain its order at all? It didn't, did it?",
  "Excuse me - -",
  "Yeah. How do we know that's what the district court adopted? I have -- is it the order on 24a of the appendix to the petition?",
  "It doesn't mention -- it doesn't mention which of the two of your arguments the district court is relying on.",
  "We're not talking about the rule. We're trying to find out what it was the district court did. Now, the court of appeals assumed the worst. I mean, assumed what makes the case the hardest for you, and that is the court of appeals assumed that the district court relied on 401. Is it customary to assume the worst?",
  "If there's any basis on which the district court's decision would have been correct, the district court's decision is upheld.",
  "You -- you want to defend the harder ground, I understand. But what Justice Breyer has just said is not necessarily so. The \"similarly situated\" argument applies under 403 as well. If they're similarly situated, the -- the time it would take to let in these other things and rebuttal of them, plus the prejudicial effect on the jury, would be outweighed by the fact that they're similarly situated, and, therefore, that it is stronger proof. I don't see that one can tell from the district court's order whether the district court was relying on 401 or 403. And certainly, you just don't want to defend 403. I think you're digging a hole for yourself.",
  "Well, but here you have a company of 70,000 people.",
  "It is hard to see what wouldn't be marginally relevant if you think that's marginally relevant. It has to be a different supervisor in a different time frame. I mean, sure.",
  "Why is that relevant -- the same vicinity? You're -- you're - -",
  "Opposing counsel has said they are -- they are three supervisors up. What does the same vicinity have anything to do with this?",
  "Well, one -- one would have some -- some tendency - -",
  "What about one instead of three? Would that have some tendency? I guess it would.",
  "Why, by the way, do you think this was excluded under -- under 401 rather than 403?",
  "Well, then why should it be assumed it was done properly rather than improperly?",
  "What was said in the order? I see nothing in the order that indicates it is under 401.",
  "But - -",
  "That's very relevant to the 403 determination.",
  "Picky, picky, picky on the trial court. I must say.",
  "It seems to me this order should be -- should be given -- it should be treated as if, it could be sustained, it should be sustained.",
  "But you assert that the mere fact that it is pursuant to the same reduction in force is enough of a connection.",
  "What if even one of these three had existed? Only one these three?",
  "One of these three other employees who complained about age discrimination. Would that have the same tendency to show it?",
  "You think one is enough?",
  "Yes.",
  "No, I'm not talking about somebody up at the top. I'm talking about somebody on the same level as the supervisor that you're concerned with. One other supervisor in this company of 70,000 has -- is accused of having made age-discriminatory decisions.",
  "Well, all of these are just accused. We have -- none of this has been proven.",
  "So - -",
  "Mr. Egan, what if I think that, had he engaged in a balancing, it would have been an abuse of discretion not to exclude it? What if I think that? Then what happens with this case?",
  "No, but I am worried about having five trials -- you know, one trial turning into six trials. I mean those are the factors that I am concerned about.",
  "Yes.",
  "They may have just thought the game isn't worth the candle. Just thought we've sunk so much money into this case by now and it's just not worth the risk.",
  "And that's the problem that concerns me. It is not the question of whether the trial is going to last for three weeks. It is a question at the prospect that the trial will last for three weeks and they will have to go out and find other people in their organization and depose them and bring them in to show them it is not the culture. They just say it is not worth the candle. Just settle the case and get out. All of these things are relevant to how you rule on 403 it seems to me.",
  "It seems very strange to me that we -- there's been -- the case went to the jury without the evidence you wanted to get in. The jury found for the company. Now if the -- if the trial court is going to properly exclude the evidence under 403, we should then have the very same trial with a new jury? That doesn't seem proper.",
  "You -- you don't want that clarification to be done at the expense your client, I take it?",
  "The district judge is in a much better position to decide those matters, such as you know, he -- his -- his response was -- was slow on -- one the question of, you know, whether he could consider the death penalty. I can't tell that from a cold record, and that's why we -- rely upon the trial judge.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, these are peremptory challenges. It seems to me if you have one -- one juror who says I think I could and another one who said I could, I'm going to strike the one who said I think I could.",
  "Did all 21 say I think I could?",
  "I don't understand how the dean could resolve his problem.",
  "The man's problem, what he's worried about is that he has to put in a certain number of hours of teaching. And what was it? A couple of months before the end of the term? It was going to be very - -",
  "Whatever. He had to be there to observe. He had to put in a certain number of hours. How could the dean say oh, don't worry, it's no problem?",
  "The hours requirement is a requirement for the degree. I don't think deans have the ability to -- to waive degree requirements.",
  "Maybe the dean was just saying oh, he'll be able to do it, and - -",
  "-- that wouldn't inspire a great deal of confidence in me, even if I said okay.",
  "My reaction would be - - would depend on how he said okay. And if I were sitting there as the trial judge, I -- I could discern whether okay meant well, you know, that's what he says but I'm still going to have a hard time digging out those hours for the remaining time that I have in the term. I don't know how he said okay.",
  "Even if the assurance is only secondhand, right?",
  "When the dean says it's okay, that's all right.",
  "It sounds like the right answer to me.",
  "What does that have to do with anything?",
  "So he broke his promise. I mean sue him or something, but I don't see how it has anything to do with whether a fair jury was -- was - -",
  "Well, that's not just racially polarizing. I mean maybe it is that, but it is also a case in which a man killed his wife with a knife.",
  "The same as here.",
  "And then feigned a mental illness by his -- his great-escape escapade, and that is -- that is what the prosecutor said he was trying to bring before the jury.",
  "As to life imprisonment or as to the death penalty?",
  "Where is this? I -- 364? Show me - -",
  "Right.",
  "Well, we -- we have to go -- your -- this is enough of a fact-specific inquiry for any appellate court, even when we go into the allegations that the prosecution did make. Now you're saying we also have to imagine other reasons, which he didn't state were the reasons why he struck, but which might have been. You really think that that's enough to - -",
  "It is not the problem with it. It is your problem with the record.",
  "It is not mine.",
  "The rule is not that you can't -- so long as you have some black on the jury, you can strike the rest.",
  "Any single person.",
  "Another reason to do it would be to preserve your right on appeal, to object to those jurors.",
  "Maybe your rule here that -- that we're not going to postulate the worst reason for a prosecutorial strike rather than a good reason when you haven't given the prosecution an opportunity to set forth a good reason.",
  "What if the manufacturer wants to make what you call an improvement? Can it simply market the product with that improvement without further FDA action?",
  "Even if it is designed to improve safety and effectiveness?",
  "Right, but those devices had not been -- they were just grandfathered. They had not been specifically approved as safe and effective by the FDA. Right?",
  "What was the State requirement there? I mean, what was the Federal requirement there? It was simply that the device had been on the market before the law became effective. Right?",
  "Yeah.",
  "Well, but the point is that the -- to follow up on Justice Kennedy's question, the point is that the FDA in Lohr had never made a determination of weighing the risks against the benefits, as they do for the issuance of PMA's. And so the jury was not replowing the same ground that the FDA had already plowed in Lohr.",
  "Does that mean that, under the Food and Drug regulation, the States can issue their own regulations that contradict the Federal approval?",
  "No. No. I'm talking about drugs. Not medical devices. You say that - -",
  "Well, no. I mean, you can comply with both. It's just additional -- you have to go further to comply with the State rule, so there's no conflict. It's easy to - -",
  "Then the States can issue regulations that go beyond -- beyond what the FDA says in drug matters? I would be surprised if that's the case.",
  "And is that the only basis here? Conflict -- there's no conflict? It's all okay under the Medical Devices Act?",
  "They can add additional requirements so long as -- and I suppose they can do this by regulation -- so long as these additional requirement dos not prevent complying with the Federal requirements? So long as there's no conflict, the States can add additional requirements under the Medical Devices Act? That's not my understanding of it.",
  "It is field preemption, isn't it?",
  "If it - -",
  "Well, that's not the way I would -- the jury has to say that? I mean, in fact - -",
  "In fact, that's what's going on, but it could have been safe if -- if they had made the change that the FDA rejected. But the case goes to the jury and that's, in fact, what's going on.",
  "The trial is, you know, had he -- had he made this change, it would have been safe, but he didn't make the change and, therefore, you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, should hold the company liable.",
  "So it just - -",
  "It just has to be the theory of the case. We have to look at each jury verdict and decide whether that was the basis on which the jury made the decision.",
  "That's under State law, but you -- you don't say that Federal preemption requires that; you say that by the grace of New York State, that may be the situation, but New York State can change that law, as far as you're concerned, right?",
  "New York State can let it go to the jury, despite -- despite what the FDA has done. You've said that it's simply a defense under New York State law and the law of most States. But it doesn't have to be a defense under New York State law.",
  "I thought that's the point Justice Ginsburg was implying.",
  "Of course, this is all a little unrealistic. It is not as though some expert agency of the State has conducted a very scientific inquiry and decided that there's something safer than what the FDA approved or that it's negligent to issue what the FDA approved. What's going on is simply one jury has decided that in its judgment, there was a safer device that should have been used; and because of the judgment of that one jury, the manufacturer is placed at risk in selling a device that scientists at the FDA have said is okay. I find that extraordinary.",
  "Mr. Olson, the other side says well, you know, these are all horribles but, in fact, we have had tort suits and manufacturers haven't taken their products off the market. This is all just a Chicken Little kind of a - -",
  "Additional requirements are not necessarily conflicting requirements. You can comply with - -",

  "Who says that -- let's consider first the basis on which the court of appeals decided this case. They decided it -- in Rasul, we had held that the habeas statute extended to Guantanamo, and that those people who had filed their suits before the statute, at least, could bring a suit. Congress acted. And enacted a new habeas statute which makes it very clear that the habeas statute, at least, does not apply to these people in Guantanamo. Your assertion here is that there is a common law constitutional right of habeas corpus that does not depend upon any statute. Do you have a single case in the 220 years of our country or, for that matter, in the five centuries of the English empire in which habeas was granted to an alien in a territory that was not under the sovereign control of either the United States or England.",
  "What is -- what are they?",
  "What cases -- what case in particular do you think in Rasul?",
  "Mwenya involved an English -- an English subject, not an alien.",
  "The question there is an alien.",
  "So it's totally irrelevant.",
  "In both of those cases, it was a citizen, nonetheless. In 220 years of our history, or five centuries of the -- do you have a single case in which it was not a citizen of England or a citizen of the United States in which a common-law writ of habeas corpus issued to a piece of land that was not within the sovereign jurisdiction?",
  "They were not regarded as part of the crown's dominion, but they were part of the crown's sovereign territory.",
  "Okay, try them. I mean, line them up.",
  "And the cases were decided under a statute that applied in India, not under -- under the common law. And the writ did not come from England; the writ came from English courts in India under a statute. And we decided that in Rasul. I mean, you want to do that in Rasul, that's fine. But you are appealing to a common law right that somehow found its way into our constitution without, as far as I can discern, a single case in which the writ ever to a non-citizen.",
  "Counsel, we had 400,000 German prisoners in this country during World War II. And not a -- you say it's clear in the Vietnam example that the Chief Justice gave you, it's clear that habeas would lie. 400,000 of these people. It never occurred to them.",
  "And many of them were civilians, by the way, and not in uniform. Not a single habeas petition filed.",
  "He claims he wasn't assisting the German army, just as these people here claim that they were not attacking U.S. bases.",
  "Where -- where was he held?",
  "Are you sure he was being held in Pennsylvania?",
  "I mean, you're being held within the jurisdiction of the United States. I am still waiting for a single case, other than the Indian case which you mentioned which was under a statute, a single case in which an alien that -- in a -- in a territory not within the Crown, was granted habeas corpus. And it's not enough to say there was a statute that applied on the seas. That's fine. Just give me one case. There's not a single one in all of this lengthy history.",
  "Is the Geneva Convention modeled after the Constitution of the United States?",
  "What it means by \"prisoner of war\" is the same thing that the Constitution means?",
  "General Clement, if we had to either charge or release these people, what would they be charged with? Waging war against the United States? Is there a statute that prevents non-citizens from waging war against the United States and provides criminal penalties?",
  "No, but he's not in the same circumstance. I mean, he's made his choice. He was offered voluntary departure, which had advantages. He could arrange his affairs and go when he wanted within 60 days. What he gave up was the ability to appeal the determination. That doesn't seem to me as, as outrageous. I mean, it happens all the time. When a criminal defendant pleads to a lesser charge, he gives up the ability to appeal. And that's what's going on here. He has gotten the advantage of a voluntary departure and given up the ability to appeal. I don't bleed for him. It seems to me it's an option presented before him and he took it.",
  "Still and all, it's part of the deal. Even better. Even better. He hasn't even given up all his appeals.",
  "It's just, part of the deal he gave up this little ability to reopen, and that's - - that's the choice he made when he accepted voluntary departure.",
  "That's what I thought.",
  "But in your discussion with Justice Breyer you seemed to be saying that he can hang around right through the appeal.",
  "That's by regulation, though, that he can't, he cannot pursue that from out of the country.",
  "So I'm not following this. I thought the assumption was we're going to be using the government's new proposed system, in which the acceptance of voluntary departure is eliminated when you file a reopening petition, right. So can the government then proceed to deport you involuntarily or is that also going to be stayed until, until completion of the reopening petition?",
  "And that, that involuntary deportation would effectively cancel the, the petition for reopening, right?",
  "Why are you willing to leave the involuntary deportees in that position, whereas you're not willing to leave the voluntary deportees in that position, that their reopening petition just vanishes? Why is it any fairer for the involuntary deportees than for the voluntary? In fact it's probably fairer for the voluntary because they made their choice.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, I think, I think that your, your opposing counsel gave a good answer to that. I also thought it was a quid pro quo, but it's a very strange quid pro quo. I could understand the government saying, look, if you accept voluntary departure your reopening is dead; you have to choose between asking for reopening or voluntary departure. But that's not the quid pro quo you're saying that the government is adopting. The quid pro quo is if you accept voluntary departure you roll the dice as to whether your reopening petition will be decided in time. It isn't dead. It's still there, but you just have to hope that it will be decided before you get deported.",
  "I don't understand your answer. You said you can or you can't from out of the country?",
  "So why, if you want to have a petition for reopening, why don't you just file an appeal and then file a petition for reopening and the appeal will enable you to stay in the country until your -- your petition for reopening is - -",
  "You're appealing the immigration judge's decision.",
  "The immigration judge's decision, you're appealing that to the BIA.",
  "And that -- that enables you to stay in the country - -",
  "And at the same time you file a petition to reopen the -- the administrative law judge's - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Do you agree with counsel for the government as to how long it typically takes for these motions to reopen to be disposed of? He said something like 55 percent take, what, more than - -",
  "Your answer is yes, but the Attorney General's rule would prevent that -- proposed rule would - -",
  "Who would be a medical doctor -- and medical doctors, according to the Code of Ethics of the American Medical Association, can't participate.",
  "Mr. Verrilli, this is an execution, not surgery. The other side contends that you need to monitor the depth of the unconsciousness. When you expect to bring the person back and do not want harm to occur to the person. But they assert that to know whether the person is unconscious or not all it takes is a slap in the face and shaking the person.",
  "That's their contention.",
  "With regard to the trial court's failure to make findings about the availability of people to do this and about the possibility of - - practical possibility of more effective and less painful drugs, was that a failure to ignore evidence that you produced?",
  "Did you introduce evidence to show that indeed medically trained personnel were readily available to do the things you say?",
  "I'm very reluctant to send it back to the trial court so we can have a nationwide cessation of all executions while the trial court finishes its work and then it goes to another appeal to the State supreme court and ultimately, well, it could take years.",
  "You wouldn't want that to happen.",
  "We have been discussing this as though that is a constitutional requirement. Where does that come from, that you must find the method of execution that causes the least pain? We have approved electrocution, we have approved death by firing squad. I expect both of those have more possibilities of painful death than the protocol here. Where does this come from that in the, in the execution of a person who has been convicted of killing people we must choose the least painful method possible? Is that somewhere in our Constitution.",
  "No, I don't agree with that. The concern was with torture, which is the intentional infliction of pain. Now, these States, the three-quarters of the States that have the death penalty, all except one of whom use this method of execution, they haven't set out to inflict pain. To the contrary, they have introduced it presumably because they, indeed, think it's a more humane way, although not one that is free of all risk.",
  "No - -",
  "Unnecessary and wanton, unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.",
  "Well, then, you're changing your position. You said -- you just said earlier that we didn't have to find the least painful way.",
  "But if you're not using the least painful way, you are inflicting unnecessary pain, aren't you?",
  "Can you rectify that?",
  "Hanging certainly would, right?",
  "Is that a hard question? Is that a hard question, whether hanging would, whether you had experts who understood the dropweight, you know, that was enough that it would break the neck?",
  "Hanging's no good. What about electrocution?",
  "It has to be, it has to be painless?",
  "I would think you'd have to show it's unusual, not painless. I mean, cruel and unusual is what we're talking about. There's no painless requirement in there.",
  "Where does this unnecessary pain requirement come from?",
  "Dictum in our cases, right?",
  "Dictum in our cases.",
  "If that's part of the analysis, this never ends.",
  "If that's part of the analysis, there will always be some claim that there is some new method that's been devised, and once again executions are stayed throughout the country.",
  "Those who oppose capital punishment entirely across the board are quite willing to take a careful look at everything. They are quite willing to take a look at other alternatives. That's the problem we come up with a decision that requires a careful look in every case whenever there is a newly developed method of execution the problem will always be before us and executions will always be impermissible. We agree with those concerns, Justice Scalia, I want to be clear. Our standard is not a least risk - -",
  "You say that substantial, that comparison with other possibilities is not necessary so long as the only risk that is coming is a risk of negligence or improper execution of what, of what the protocol requires right?",
  "You would say that so long, so long as the only risk comes from negligent application of the protocol, no comparison is required?",
  "And if we decided that, if we decided that if this protocol is properly executed, it does not create a substantial risk that would be the end of the matter wouldn't it.",
  "And we would not have another case in front of us next year.",
  "Whose thumb is the magistrate under? Is he under the thumb of Article I or Article II or Article III?",
  "Who decides whether he stays on or she stays on as a magistrate?",
  "So we're really not talking here about giving away any Article III power. I mean, the magistrate is only subject to Article III.",
  "That may well be, but the reason -- the reason presumably is that an Article III judge, which goes -- who goes through a much more substantial process of selection and confirmation is much more qualified. Now, if you want to make that argument, that's fine, but that's a quite different argument from saying that we're giving away Article III powers to magistrates, right? Magistrates are creatures of Article III.",
  "You say it was the holding in Patton?",
  "I suppose it was dicta.",
  "I thought what Adams stood for was that the defendant can himself waive the right to jury without advice of counsel, that if he wants to do it on his own he can do it without counsel. It doesn't mean that if counsel does it without his objection at the time it's invalid.",
  "I mean, yes, but - - everybody concedes that, but the question is by whom? Certainly very many rights, you will acknowledge, can be waived by counsel.",
  "So you can't simply say it requires an express and knowing waiver, attributing that express and knowing waiver to the defendant. Sure, it does, but who has to be \"express,\" and who has to be \"knowing\"? That's the issue before us here.",
  "Could I - -",
  "Are we supposed to go through every one of the rights that a defendant has in a trial one by one and decide, you know, this one the lawyer can make, this one the defendant must make personally?",
  "One by one? I mean, I never thought that that was the approach we take.",
  "Did she rule on strikes for cause?",
  "But that -- I mean, that is, I suppose, the most significant power that the judge who is conducting the voir dire or presiding at the voir dire has, to allow or not allow a strike - -",
  "It's our list, after all, right?",
  "You think it would be valid or don't think it wouldn't be valid?",
  "Could I just -- a question that has troubled me. Basically, what you say that is of such importance here is the composition of a jury. I mean, that's what it all boils down to, who's going to rule on the composition of the jury, should it be a magistrate or should it be an Article III judge. But if -- you know, if that is -- is so fundamental that it needs a special rule that the waiver has to be personal by the defendant, then you can say the same thing about -- about objections to -- to the Court's failure to permit a strike for cause. That affects the composition of the jury. Now do you need -- do you need the defendant's consent to the judge's ruling on that point, or is it enough if the lawyer makes no objection?",
  "I see. I see.",
  "For which purpose you'd include the receipts?",
  "For which purpose you would include the receipts that he sent to his girlfriend instead of putting them in the corporate treasury?",
  "I'm less concerned with the word \"distribution\" in the statute than I am with the phrase \"with respect to its stock\" -- \"distribution made by a corporation to a shareholder with respect to its stock.\" Now, the court below held that there had to be a conscious intent to return capital. Even if I disagree with that and think that that was wrong, isn't the Government right that it nonetheless is the burden to establish that the distribution here was a distribution with respect to stock, and the distribution was given to the girlfriend who owns no stock in the corporation. How does it become a distribution with respect to stock?",
  "Or girlfriends. I mean, why doesn't it distinguish a girlfriend as much as it distinguishes an employee who's receiving back a loan?",
  "And the Government would say yes?",
  "Yes, they're really - - they're really between a rock and a hard place on this stuff.",
  "You are pretty sure they won't.",
  "The court below didn't give him a chance - -",
  "-- to establish that. The court below required him to show an intent to distribute capital.",
  "But that was -- we're just not on the same page here. That's not what the -- the decision you're defending said. The decision you're defending did not say that it was incumbent on the defendant to show that it was with respect to stock. They said it was incumbent on the defendant to show that it was intended to be a return of capital.",
  "And that's just a wholly different issue, and it seems to me the best you can get out of this case, the way you're arguing it, is a remand for them to apply the proper test.",
  "I doubt that. Then - - then, you would say, when it is not a criminal prosecution for failure to pay taxes, so long as somebody, when they take the money, intended it to be a return of dividends, it does not become a return of capital. Are you sure you're willing to live with that intent requirement?",
  "At the time -- is it important for the tax treatment that at the time of the distribution it be intended to be either a return of capital or dividends? Does that make the difference as to whether you're going to be able to tax it or not?",
  "Well, I'm not -- we are not talking about distribution.",
  "We are talking about the intent that it be a return of capital or not.",
  "Either one.",
  "It could be anything at all. So in other words, there is no preliminary requirement that you intend that it be a return of capital. Right. So if the Court of Appeals said that here, it was wrong.",
  "He wants a chance to argue that. He was not given a chance to argue that.",
  "He said -- and it seems to me that this is enough to put you on notice -- \"Boulware will present further evidence that all of the alleged unreported income was either a loan or advance or was used by Boulware for corporate purposes or for the benefit of HIE.\"",
  "Now, \"for corporate purposes\" would include either a return of capital or a dividend, payment out to shareholders.",
  "Surely he is entitled to try to prove that. And I'm still hung up on your assertion that he made no proffer on it below. Here's another portion of the joint appendix. The expert, his expert, he says, will further explain that if Boulware used -- this is on page 97, bottom of 97: \"If Boulware used the moneys for corporate purposes, the moneys were not income to Boulware. Alternatively, the expert will explain that if the moneys were not loans or advances or if Boulware did not use the moneys for corporate purposes, then as the controlling shareholder, the moneys could be deemed a constructive dividend or a return of capital to Boulware, which may or may not be income depending on whether or not HIE had earnings.\" That seems to me presenting the claim that he asserts he should have been given an opportunity to present.",
  "Even so, no harm no foul, if, in fact, you hadn't proffered any evidence that would enable you to meet the -- in respect to stock requirement. Now, what do you say to the contention that you hadn't proffered anything?",
  "Well, wait. Doesn't he have to show, still show, that it's with respect to stock?",
  "That one little element: That he has to show the distribution was not because this was his girlfriend, but it was with respect to stock, and the record is -- is that the intent?",
  "The issue is whether the Government wants to convict more -- more malfeasors or whether it wants to collect more money, and the latter obviously prevails in the cases, right?",
  "You're saying you're one step removed. You're making your determination on the basis of eligibility for retirement, which in turn is based on age. And you're saying that that - -",
  "Huh?",
  "Right.",
  "You'd be in better shape if it was in legislative history and not in the preamble. We probably would take it into account.",
  "Well, why does that matter? I mean, the exception in the statute is for -- for retirement, taking age into account for retirement, is narrowly crafted. It says that they can make any decision about -- they can require the attainment of a minimum age as a condition of eligibility for normal or early retirement. Now, we have not read that to exclude adding an additional element to age, namely age plus years of service. We don't say that that disables you from the -- from that exemption. Why can't you add a third factor? Age, years of service, and disability.",
  "And - -",
  "Just say that again. Just say the last thing again. I didn't follow you.",
  "Why? I -- I think -- you mean in the future?",
  "Under their belt. I see.",
  "Before -- before we get to that, can we talk about standing a little? Who are the -- who are the complainants here?",
  "Courts below are sometimes wrong.",
  "Well, they still have to identify individuals who are members. Now, what does it take to be a member of the Democratic Party here?",
  "I thought -- I thought they took the position that anybody who voted or intended to vote Democratic is a member of the Democratic Party.",
  "Is there any way in which you can say -- and I thought this was the theory of associational standing -- that this individual has voluntarily given this organization the right to represent that person for particular purposes?",
  "But that doesn't mean that I'm willing to have the Democratic Party represent me for all sorts of purposes. And these people can bring their own individual challenges. I mean, I'm not questioning their ability to do it. But, but why is the Democratic Party their representative?",
  "That organization had members. I mean, you did join that organization.",
  "And they identified members who would be, who would be annoyed by the noise.",
  "Excuse me. Even in its own right, it has to identify somebody that's a member or not.",
  "Exactly, Democrats in particular, I suppose.",
  "Well, did you have anybody who said, I don't have a voter ID?",
  "I plan to come in this next election, I plan to vote, and I don't have a voter ID card?",
  "Well, do we know that that religious exemption won't be made?",
  "Do we know that that religious exemption won't be made? Nobody's asserted it.",
  "No, no. I mean in this case. In this case you're claiming there's a problem for people who, for religious reasons, don't want to have their photograph taken. Do we know that if that's the reason that they assert, I can't get the photograph, the State will say you can't vote?",
  "It's not a burden if you're not indigent?",
  "17 miles is 17 miles for the rich and the poor.",
  "The people who are dead or have moved away would certainly not be objecting.",
  "I wasn't talking about that. I was talking about whether there is a genuine threat of fraud which the State is moving to eliminate --",
  "-- and your assertion that, you know, it's not much of a problem because the person whom you're impersonating would find out about it. I mean -- but that's certainly not the case for people who have moved away or people, you know, the people in the graveyards that are still on the rolls.",
  "I'd say likely.",
  "And why, why can't the people injured by this law appear themselves and say the law can't be applied to us? You seem to accept that a facial challenge is appropriate here. Why is -- some different kind of a facial challenge. I thought in the usual facial challenge you have to show that there is no situation in which the law cannot be constitutionally applied.",
  "Then why are we arguing about whether there is one half of one percent of the electorate who may be adversely affected and as to whom it might be unconstitutional? That one half of one percent, if and when it is sought to be applied to them, have a cause of action to say you can't apply it to me. But why -- what precedent is there for knocking down this entire law on a facial challenge when I think everybody agrees that in the vast majority of cases it doesn't impose a significant hardship?",
  "Does that scare you, Mr. Fisher, that there can't be a facial challenge?",
  "I mean, every facial challenge is an immense dictum on the part of this Court, isn't it?",
  "This Court is sitting back and looking at the ceiling and saying, oh, we can envision not the case before us, but other cases. Maybe it's one half of one percent or maybe it's 45 percent, who knows. But we can imagine cases in which this law could be unconstitutional, and therefore, the whole law is unconstitutional. That's not ordinarily the way courts behave, is it?",
  "Now, we've done that in the First Amendment area.",
  "Suppose you -- you have your photograph taken when you register. You're really an out of state person, you go in and register, you make up an address, you come in, you have your photograph taken; it proves that you were the person that registers. It doesn't prove that you were the person that lives at that address, or that you are of such and such an age and whatnot, which the -- the means of identification that you require would show, wouldn't it?",
  "You can't, can you?",
  "The national policy it to make it both easy to register and easy to vote.",
  "And for nonindigent people. I mean, there may be - -",
  "Some very well-to-do elderly, you don't drive, and they are in the same position.",
  "Don't you need a birth certificate to get a passport?",
  "Yes. So maybe that's unconstitutional too.",
  "The provisional ballots would be counted, I assume.",
  "The provisional ballots would be counted. The ones that were unconstitutionally prevented from voting -- those claims would be counted.",
  "Things called class actions, right?",
  "Who do you do with illiterates who don't have a signature? Do you match \"Xs,\" or what?",
  "Aren't there going to be problems under any system you imagine?",
  "Well, if you want to talk about increments, why shouldn't we also ask whether our judgment does more harm than good; whether -- whether the remedy for -- for the inconvenience to a small number of people is to wash away the whole statute, which in most of its applications is perfectly okay? Why don't we do that weighing of benefits and burdens of increments versus needs?",
  "Mr. McCullough, the proposition that you're arguing, does it apply at the Federal level as well? Suppose -- suppose I think that my neighbor next door is growing marijuana and I have probable cause to believe that, all right? So I go in and search his house; and sure enough, there is marijuana. And I bring it to the police's attention, and they eventually arrest him. Is that lawful search?",
  "I'm a State actor, I guess. You know - -",
  "You know, a Supreme Court Justice should not be - -",
  "-- should not be living next door to somebody growing marijuana. It doesn't seem right.",
  "Don't dance around. Is it -- is it rendered an unreasonable search by the fact that I'm not a law enforcement officer at all?",
  "So any Federal employee can go crashing around conducting searches and seizures?",
  "So long as he has probable cause?",
  "That's fantastic.",
  "Do you really think that?",
  "Or that you are an administrative law judge at the, you know, Bureau of Customs? It doesn't matter?",
  "What about a janitor? You're a janitor, a federally employed janitor.",
  "His neighbor is growing marijuana, and he's just as offended as a Supreme Court Justice would be. Can he conduct a search?",
  "Wow.",
  "Maybe we could say that in this, in these unique circumstances, where the officers could not let the fellow drive off without a license, it was not unreasonable to arrest him, but in some other situation where they had no arrest authority it would be.",
  "I mean, you know, let's assume that the stop was not based on some, some deficiency in his license or some deficiency in the car -- I don't know what else it could be -- like, he had been going too fast, okay? And it's just a misdemeanor. He was five miles over the speed limit. Now, in that situation you couldn't say, as you've said here, gee, if they just let him go, he'd still be driving without a license; they had to arrest him; they had no choice. In that situation, he wouldn't necessarily be going above the speed limit. Would that be -- why couldn't you say it was reasonable here, but it wouldn't be reasonable there?",
  "If that's the argument you're making, then don't bring forward the argument that they couldn't let him go because he'd be in violation of the law. If you want us to make that narrow a holding, I guess we can. Is that what you want us to do?",
  "No, you're asking us to balance. You're asking us to say, after all, in this case if they hadn't arrested he would have been violating the law as soon as they let him go.",
  "You say this was not unlawful under Virginia law, then, because of the factor you brought forth?",
  "Well, I don't know what you're talking about a discretionary call. It wasn't a discretionary call. He couldn't arrest the person.",
  "Does the person making the arrest at least have to have some arrest authority?",
  "Or will a janitor do the job? A janitor at the Justice Department becomes imbued with the mission of the Department and he goes around arresting people or searching people.",
  "Just as this person here didn't have positive law authority to engage in an arrest.",
  "Yes, but he was purporting to act in an official capacity. And he did, indeed, give the marijuana to the officials at the Justice Department.",
  "But you think they would accept arresting somebody for not wearing a seat belt?",
  "It seems to me we've crossed that bridge with Atwater.",
  "No. It's designed to test whether you really mean unlawful under State law. Either you don't mean it, because something that violates a municipal ordnance is unlawful under State law, and yet you would not apply your test. So you could express your test differently, unlawful under State statutory law.",
  "What about Cooper -- Cooper v California?",
  "Mr. Goldstein, can I bring you back to Cooper v. California?",
  "Which you say is a good case for you. I don't see how you can say that. This was a case of a car impounded. The State court had said that there was no authority to search the car, simply because it was impounded, and we said the question here is not whether the search was authorized by State law; the question is rather whether the search was a reasonable one under the Fourth Amendment. Just as a search authorized by State law may be an unreasonable one under that amendment, so may a search not expressly authorized by State law be justified as a constitutional reasonable one. And you think that helps your case?",
  "Even though the State law did not authorize it.",
  "They were assume ing, in that passage, that the State law did not authorize it, or otherwise the passage makes no sense.",
  "Mr. McCullough, what is here, for some reason the Commonwealth did not cite Cooper v. California, which I can't understand unless you agree with your friend that it has been overruled by later cases.",
  "I understand. Why didn't you cite Cooper v. California?",
  "I would have thought you would -- you would say that when you have a contract which says that any disputes under this shall be arbitrated pursuant to the rules of the AAA or whatever, that that does automatically exclude a parallel proceeding. Otherwise, provisions like that make no sense at all; they achieve nothing.",
  "Nor do you mean that California applies even when it contradicts the express provisions of your agreement? I mean, the specific governs of the general?",
  "But that's not positive Federal law. What stops him from doing it is the contractual agreement, isn't it, between the parties? The FAA just says that the State will not set aside that contractual agreement.",
  "When we say we'll arbitrate all disputes under this contract, it means we'll arbitrate all disputes under this contract; neither one of us will go to court.",
  "I used to teach contract law, and I am sure that when you say you'll arbitrate, it means you won't litigate. And even if I didn't ever teach contract law, it would still be the law.",
  "Did you take a position below? Your friend says that this is brand new up here.",
  "Why would you want this to happen? Why -- who would imagine such a system in which you bring it to the Labor Commissioner and you prevent the matter from being resolved immediately with an arbitrator. I don't know how long does it take for the Labor Commissioner? I don't know.",
  "Eight months. But then when he's done - -",
  "She. No matter what happens, you go back to the arbitrator. Who in his right mind would set up such a system?",
  "This person is not a talent agent.",
  "Judgment involved would have been binding - -",
  "-- on the third parties. You don't -- and you assert that the judgment here wouldn't be binding at all. It's just because the Labor Commissioner, he or she, is such an expert on this - - your opponent says she's not at all - -",
  "Well, I imagine that's highly debatable. It's a different case where you say you have to wait for a court decision which will be conclusive as to many of the people in the case.",
  "No. His hypothetical was that the court decision would just be advisory and the arbitrator could ignore it.",
  "Just get, you know, a knowledgeable person's input.",
  "This contract said the same thing. This contract will be governed by California law.",
  "Would it suck up this provision that says you have to go to the Superior Court?",
  "No. I don't think so either.",
  "Excuse me. You say -- I thought you said it doesn't become binding. That it is just advice to the arbitrator. Once you -- once you get the remand to the arbitrator, it is not binding.",
  "Right.",
  "But - -",
  "Well, I don't understand - - so you incorporate California law. I interpret that to mean substantive law of California. You say also incorporates -- and this is what I find peculiar. California law gives you a procedural right to go to the labor commission. But it also gives you a procedural right to go to superior court. And, yet, you acknowledge that the arbitration agreement, when you say we will arbitrate, forecloses your using the superior court. Why doesn't it foreclose your using the labor commissioner? I don't understand how you slice the bologna that thin. To me, if it excludes California procedures, it excludes both the labor commissioner and the superior court.",
  "Let me -- I want to understand that answer. California law includes the Superior Court as much as it includes the labor commissioner.",
  "So the California Supreme Court would construct a system in which you get the advice of this expert, the Labor Commissioner. One of the parties thinks that this expert's advice is ridiculous, just absolutely wrong. Now, California law generally considers the Superior Court smarter than the Labor Commissioner, which is why you get de novo review before the Superior Court.",
  "No?",
  "It is stupider than the Labor Commissioner.",
  "All right. I will amend it. The California Superior Court is ex officio smarter than the Labor Commissioner, okay? And yet, one of the parties who thinks the Labor Commissioner is dead wrong doesn't get a chance to have this advice corrected the way the California constitution envisions, by the ex officio smarter Superior Court.",
  "And that is the scheme that the California Supreme Court is going to embed in California law?",
  "The latter is disputed. The latter is vigorously disputed.",
  "You think Volt would have come out the same way if -- if in fact, all of the parties in this other litigation had agreed to arbitration? You have any doubt - -",
  "Yeah. I do, too.",
  "Writing broadly is known as dictum, isn't it?",
  "I think you can say that all of the crimes that are listed require mens rea and DUI doesn't; does it?",
  "That's a big different, isn't it?",
  "You've run away from me on \"otherwise.\" I think the \"otherwise\" ties the last paragraph to the -- to the preceding four enumerated crimes. And if -- if it had just gone on to say \"or presents a serious risk of injury\" without the \"otherwise,\" then I don't think you'd have any argument that you have to somehow look to the degree of injury, the -- the manner of injury that the four enumerated crimes have. The \"otherwise\" ties it together, \"or otherwise presents a risk of serious injury.\" And I think the implication is that the - - that the -- the injury must be similar to the -- at least in degree to the enumerated crimes beforehand. I wouldn't run away from the \"otherwise.\"",
  "I don't -- I don't understand this line of argue. You would exclude, let's say, physical assault from -- from this, I mean assault with intent to kill, because it's not a property crime?",
  "That wouldn't be included in the \"otherwise involved\"?",
  "Ms. Kruger, what I don't understand about this statute as you're interpreting it is why you need any of it except the last phrase? Once you give the last phrase, \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\" all of the rest of it is automatically included. \"Has as an element the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\" -- that obviously presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. Or is burglary, arson, extortion, the use of explosives? Congress could have saved itself a lot of trouble by simply erasing all the rest of the statute and simply saying any conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury or not. That can't be what they meant.",
  "Why -- why would Congress go through that trouble, unless they wanted to suggest what other kind of crimes they need to include by this residual category of \"any conduct\" that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury?",
  "The degree of risk -- the degree of risk, for example?",
  "So if it doesn't come up to the degree of risk that any of those four would, it would not be included?",
  "No.",
  "Well, then what did it do? What's it do?",
  "How? How? How does it limit the latter part? Is it because they are all crimes that require mens rea, intent? So should we limit it by saying it has to be a -- a conduct that's intentional conduct that presents a serious risk?",
  "But you say it does limit it. So tell me how it limits it?",
  "That's nice. Benchmark of what? Of intent, of degree of risk?",
  "Okay. So the degree of risk has to be pretty much similar to those four?",
  "Comparable - -",
  "Oh, but it didn't mean that -- you said it didn't mean that because they could have said that and nothing else. If that's what they meant, they could have eliminated everything else that they said. They obviously meant to tie that to the preceding portions. And when you tie it to the preceding portions, you come up with some limitations of the sort that Justice Breyer was suggesting.",
  "She says not at all. Your friend on the other side says that it's something like, what, two and a half percent for burglary and point something for the chances of hurting somebody if you're driving DUI?",
  "You don't think this is just limited to intentional arson? You think negligent arson? Wow.",
  "Negligent extortion, negligent use of explosives? I mean, it's in a list of things that are talking about, you know, intentional crimes that armed career criminals would be likely to do.",
  "I don't think Congress had the slightest idea.",
  "Mr. Shanmugam, what is the government's position as to a person who is not a repeat offender? He commits the crime for the first-time. Now the government says there are alternative maximums and you have to pick whichever maximum is the higher. Why wouldn't that maximum apply to the person who commits the crime the first-time?",
  "You're adding something to the elements of the crime and in all of our cases in this field we look to the elements of the crime.",
  "And as far as the elements are concerned, the maximum sentence for those elements you say is the sentence that would be imposed upon a repeat offender.",
  "Well, there was also the statute involved in the LaBonte case, where -- where the statute said the Sentencing Commission \"shall assure that the sentencing guidelines specify a sentence to a term of imprisonment at or near the maximum term authorized for categories of defendants who have certain types of prior convictions.\"",
  "And that did focus on the -- on the nature of the defendant and not on the element of the crime.",
  "So it would be easy, of course, if recidivism were an element of the crime - -",
  "-- for a crime which includes the act plus the recidivism?",
  "Mr. Shanmugam, I didn't understand what you said about Congress's intent with regard to the guidelines when it passed ACCA. You're saying Congress did not have an eye to the guidelines, but simply had an eye to the maximum sentence within which the guidelines were applicable?",
  "Mr. Shanmugam, would you explain to me again why -- why you treat the enhancement in a State guideline system differently?",
  "It seems to me that if you get an enhancement as a ringleader it's the same thing as if you get an enhancement because you're a recidivist. What's the difference?",
  "You don't think \"ringleader\" is a broad tier.",
  "Well, some of them have simply said, we're going to let the jury decide. We're going to let the jury make these determinations that Apprendi says have to be made by the jury. But they're still -- they're still referred to as sentencing factors.",
  "Well, that's the question in the case.",
  "It's not a more serious offense when she does it the second time; it's just a more culpable offender.",
  "The government is correct, though, that when a recidivist is sentenced he is being punished for the crime, not for his recidivism. So you -- you can say that the punishment for that defined crime is 10 years when, when the person who committed the act is a recidivist, but the act he's being punished for is the same crime.",
  "I think we have applied the rule of lenity to sentencing in the past, haven't we?",
  "That's good or bad, depending upon whether -- whether your interpretation of the statute is right or the other side's.",
  "It's good to put more people in jail? I mean, that isn't necessarily what we're after. We're - -",
  "You can't have a unitary business -- a person who is a unitary business. I mean, a person can't be unitary with Exxon. I mean, when you speak of a unitary business you're talking about a corporation which, you know, is unitary with another corporation.",
  "Once you put it into a personal taxation scheme, it seems to me the whole unitary business notion has no application at all.",
  "You'd not wager, however, right?",
  "You're taxing Mead, not Nexis/Lexis?",
  "So what relevance is it that Nexis/Lexis has business in Illinois?",
  "I mean that's fine if that's who you're taxing.",
  "I might say that I don't follow that. It seems to me what you can establish from the fact that it did a lot of business in Illinois is that can you tax it and -- but I don't see how.",
  "Do you have any case like that where your ability to tax a surviving corporation has to do with, not whether the surviving corporation itself has sufficient contacts with the State, but whether some other corporation that has disappeared now but that merged into it had sufficient -- it seems to me you have to establish connection with the taxpayer. Not -- not with somebody from whom the taxpayer made some money.",
  "That's fine.",
  "But that isn't established by the mere fact that Lexis/Nexis did business there. Ultimately you have to come down to connecting it to Mead, either by your unitary business doctrine or by this functional doctrine that you're relying on.",
  "Can you tax me on stock - - on stock that I own on companies that do business in Illinois?",
  "Do you know any State that tries to do it.",
  "That's extraordinary. I don't know of any tax that a State could possibly impose, that no State has imposed.",
  "Illinois or Ohio, were you talking about?",
  "But it's subsequent conduct. If the implied license occurred, it didn't occur at the time of the sale; and it couldn't be -- it couldn't be negated at the time of the sale. If it occurred, it occurred at the time of the license, right, from the patentee of the patent at stake.",
  "And there was no such notice there. There was no such statement there that this does not -- you don't have the right to sell this for its normal uses?",
  "Yeah, but the horse is out of the barn.",
  "That -- I mean if both parties -- if both parties agree to that notice, I guess that would be something else. Did both parties agree to that notice?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, but that -- that doesn't matter to me. What matters to me is whether it was prior to the license. If there was an implied license here, it occurred at the time that the - -",
  "No. No.",
  "You give the licensee - - you implicitly give the licensee the right to permit the people to whom he sells the product to use the license.",
  "But it's given to the licensee surely.",
  "Unless it's implicit, unless it's implicit when you sell a -- a bicycle pedal that can only be used in bicycles.",
  "Did you say that?",
  "That's the notice. That's later. That's downstream. That's after the license. That's at the time of the sale.",
  "Mr. Phillips, when you say that was resolved adversely, you say there was a finding of no implied license.",
  "Was that a finding of no implied license from LGE to Intel or no implied license from Intel to the buyers?",
  "Is that the crucial -- is that the crucial step?",
  "If that - -",
  "If that was an implied license from LGE to Intel, then Intel would have authority to sell -- to sell these things for their - - for their use.",
  "I think the exhaustion, if Intel got -- if Intel got -- I'm sorry. Yes, if Intel got an implied license to the system from LGE when it sold those products, it seems to me the exhaustion doctrine would take hold and would -- would apply to that implied license just as it applied to the -- to the license of the chips.",
  "Excuse me. By its plain terms?",
  "Read it to me, would you?",
  "Is retaliation discrimination based on age? I can see your argument that it ought to be covered, but to say that the plain language covers it, I mean that's extraordinary. The plain language doesn't cover it.",
  "But in Jackson it was in a different statute and here it's in the same statute. Surely that makes a big difference.",
  "I'm not familiar with that provision. What does that provision say?",
  "Well, no. I mean, they're all in the same, in the same statute, and what that provision says is that just because we give certain relief in, in the portion applicable to private discrimination, does not mean that we give that relief in the section applicable to government discrimination, where it is explicitly withheld -- it can't be explicitly withheld -- where it is withheld, although it's explicitly included for private discrimination. I think that's the only sensible way to read that provision. It surely doesn't make two statutes out of, out of one. It is simply one statute.",
  "I think you're saying even if, even if that were the case, they would still urge the Court to come out the way they do. I don't think they're conceding that that's the case.",
  "Where is this stuff? Where is this text that we're talking about?",
  "It's not in your brief. It's not in the appendix. So I don't know what you're talking about.",
  "Which we don't have here now. I guess I can ask - -",
  "Well, that's sort of begging the question. I mean, you're saying it's not true because our interpretation of Title VII is true. But the point goes to how you ought to interpret Title VII. That is, it makes more sense to say when it's retaliatory action you use your Federally prescribed remedies within the agency. I mean, it doesn't answer the point that Justice Breyer made to say, because we want to interpret Title VII the way we want to interpret it. His point is: One reason to interpret it the way you do want to interpret it is that it makes more sense to have all of the Federal remedies applied through the agency, through the agency mechanism, rather than in court.",
  "I though we are talking here a prohibition against taking retaliatory action. Isn't that a prohibition?",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Garre, are we going to have to decide the Title VII question in this case? We don't even have the materials in front of us. They haven't been put in the appendix to the briefs. And in order to decide this case, we're going to have to decide a Title VII case that hasn't even been presented?",
  "Excuse me. Would you clarify your earlier statement: These people have no remedies just for retaliation? They do have remedies for the age discrimination, but not for retaliation?",
  "But they have remedies for age discrimination?",
  "Okay.",
  "To have a remedy.",
  "You should have given us the statute to look at if that's the case.",
  "Wasn't it clear to the government that the Ninth Circuit, which is what, about 10 percent of the country, was going to continue this interpretation of the act, and that was not a matter of any consequence to FERC or to the government?",
  "Well, wait, wait, wait. It didn't just say the agency may do it. It said the agency must do it. I don't -- I don't consider \"must\" to be an empowerment. I consider that to be a direction.",
  "Would it be a public interest finding, a finding that because of the market manipulation by the seller that affected this very contract, the public interest demands that we not hold the - -",
  "I didn't say fraud. I said market manipulation.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, I'm not entirely understanding you. Why should the fact that the seller later acquired market power have anything to do with whether the initial contract, when he did not have market power, was a fair one? The contracts are already down in black and white, his later acquisition of market power cannot affect - -",
  "I understand. But later acquisition of market power would result in a cancellation of the permission for this particular firm to enter into contracts for the future, but I don't see why it would affect the past contracts.",
  "For example - -",
  "For example, if the prices down the road turn out to be so high for the utility, that the utility would go out of business?",
  "I don't understand what that statement means, anyway. The current dysfunction carries over into -- into the future market? What does that mean?",
  "Does it mean that because of the current dysfunction, you can't predict for sure what the rates are going to be down the road? Of course it means that. But doesn't a dysfunction always mean that?",
  "And isn't that why you enter into long-term contracts?",
  "Because given the current dysfunction you have no idea what the price is going to be down the road.",
  "Well, good for them.",
  "I mean you're suggesting they should be punished for that? I don't understand what -- what follows? I mean - -",
  "Didn't your clients know that the market was chaotic at the time they entered into this long-term contract? I mean does this come as a surprise that after the fact, now that you're paying more than the market price is, you want to kick over a long-term contract you entered into? What has changed? Did you not know that the market was chaotic? Wasn't that the very reason you entered into the long-term contract.",
  "In fact, you did very well under these contracts. Initially, you were even reselling some of the energy that you got. You got it at a price so much below what was then the market that you made a profit by reselling it. But now that things have changed, you don't like the long-term contract.",
  "Mr. Wright, I really don't understand why you would -- why you say, you know, if - - if the chaos is due to the weather or maybe, you know, an Arab oil embargo or whatever, that that's perfectly okay. But if it's due to manipulation, it's bad. I can understand if you added manipulation by one of the parties, by the sellers, that I could understand. But so long as it's a factor extrinsic to the parties to the contract, what difference does it make to the buyer whether the flukishness of the market is caused by the weather or by manipulation by somebody other than the seller? In other words, I think it's not enough to show manipulation. That's what's going on in the market. And you're trying to save yourself from it. So long as it's not manipulation by the seller, I don't see how you have a -- I don't know -- an equitable case.",
  "Just and reasonable when?",
  "On the day they were agreed to.",
  "They were just and reasonable - -",
  "If you are relying on the narrowest ground that Justice Souter mentioned, namely, manipulation by the seller, wasn't it incumbent on you to demonstrate that there was manipulation by the seller? Has that been -- has that been established?",
  "Because of manipulation by somebody.",
  "Okay.",
  "May I ask, I am sure you understand that a finding that there was no manipulations that affected these contracts is not the same as a finding that there was no manipulation by these sellers in the market.",
  "And there is no such finding that there was no manipulation?",
  "And there is no finding that there was by these sellers.",
  "Which is to say it was designed to overrule Patterson.",
  "Not overrule. They can't overrule it, but change the law - -",
  "-- so that Patterson would no longer be right.",
  "I think that they would be astounded.",
  "What change did the 1991 amendment make then?",
  "You say it was intended to change the outcome of Patterson. In what respect? You say not in the respect of whether retaliation is included but in what respect then?",
  "I don't understand you. Patterson said that post-formation actions were not covered, right?",
  "Retaliation is one, but just one of many post-formation actions, right?",
  "What other post-formation actions were there that - -",
  "What was the post-formation action that was in action in Patterson?",
  "It didn't specify them. I think your point is probably that it includes the same post-formation conduct that is prohibited at formation, which is to say discrimination on the basis of race, which is not retaliation; right?",
  "Why did they -- why did they proceed under Title VII then? What -- what help - -",
  "Does -- does the person who is retaliated against, that is the person who complained and is retaliated against, have to be the person who was discriminated against?",
  "Surely -- surely, you don't mean what you just said a minute ago, that in order to have a retaliation claim you must have a discrimination claim.",
  "Surely it's your position that even when you have a discrimination claim, you don't have a retaliation claim. I thought it was your position there are no retaliation claims under this statute.",
  "Okay.",
  "Any other advantages to 1981? You get attorney's fees in 1981?",
  "But you get that under Title VII?",
  "Is there a Federal common law? Are we sitting here trying to write a Federal common law?",
  "So State courts can do that. They can make it up; can't they?",
  "Mr. Hawkins, don't we have a whole line of recent cases which say we have set our face against implying causes of action?",
  "A whole bunch of recent cases saying we're not going to do that any more.",
  "We used to do it, but we said we're not going to do it any more.",
  "So why don't you invoke those?",
  "Why do you agree with that? I don't understand why you agree with that.",
  "Then don't say \"yes.\" I mean, it may well be that Congress thought our interpretation of 1981 was perfectly reasonable, or it had no idea what our interpretation of 1981 was. But they know what they wanted to do in -- in 1991. Okay?",
  "That's all we know for sure.",
  "That Congress wanted that disposition. They weren't necessarily disapproving our prior decision. Is there anything in the statute which said the Supreme Court made a bad decision, and we're going to fix it?",
  "Did the committee vote on that committee report?",
  "So how do you know if anybody in Congress thought that?",
  "It could have been a teenager who wrote the report.",
  "That's a good argument to Congress. Congress should enact a retaliatory provision. But the statute says what it says, and what it says is that there has to be discrimination on the basis of race. And firing somebody for -- in retaliation for making a complaint is not firing him on the basis of race. Indeed, the person making the complaint may not have been the person who was racially discriminated against. You would acknowledge that you couldn't fire -- if retaliations claims lie, you couldn't fire a white whistleblower who says this employer has been discriminating against blacks. Wouldn't that white whistleblower have a cause of action for being fired?",
  "On your theory, but that has nothing to do with the text of the statute, which requires discrimination on the basis of race. I agree with you entirely that it would make sense to provide a cause of action for retaliation, but we don't write statutes. We read them. And there's nothing in this statute that says that.",
  "Well, you can say that, but it doesn't make any sense.",
  "It didn't make any sense then, either.",
  "I guess those court of appeals cases pre-1991 that found there was a retaliation claim, right, those cases were just wrong as to whether there was any post-contract claim? Right? I mean, they were wrong about that. Patterson, in effect, said you're wrong.",
  "So if they were wrong about whether there's a post-contract claim, why wouldn't they be wrong about whether there's a retaliation claim?",
  "I don't know why we should give deference to them on the one point when they've been proven wrong on the other one.",
  "It's a little more complicated than that. We inferred that cause of action in the bad old days, when we were inferring causes of action all over the place. Now, the position the Government takes here is that we should infer this new cause of action to assist the one that's already on the books. Is the Government going to be consistent in this position? And you want us to in the future go back to our prior practice of readily inferring causes of action that are not set forth in the -- in the text of this statute? Is the Government willing to live with that?",
  "Patterson was still the bad old days. When do you think the bad old days ended?",
  "Oh, I'm sorry. I was thinking of Sullivan.",
  "This is no longer Washington, right?",
  "Okay. I didn't know where he stopped and you began.",
  "I -- maybe I don't understand the -- I thought he was helping you, but maybe - -",
  "Were you helping him? I thought so.",
  "You don't have any evidence like that here anyway, do we? Do we know that this was going to \"Spendy Land\" where everybody has a lot of money? Did we know that?",
  "Does everybody have a lot of money in Mexico? Is that - -",
  "Does the statutory purpose have to be the only purpose or the principal purpose? I mean, I could conceive that the principal purpose of this transportation was to give the money back to the fellow who gave the drugs, to pay the provider of the drugs. I assume that would be the principal purpose. But what if you know that when the -- when the provider of the drugs is paid, he'll be able to spend this cash easily in Mexico, which has a cash economy? And let's assume that the latter is enough to satisfy the purpose requirement of this statute. What -- what would be the result?",
  "If you assume a primary purpose to pay off the - -",
  "Even though that wasn't the real purpose -- I mean, the real purpose was to pay off this fellow, who otherwise might come to hurt you.",
  "But once you do pay him off, you know that the money is going to be ready spendable.",
  "Because the police can't find it in that account even if it is still under your name. In an account here the police would be able to find it. In an account in the Cayman Islands, they won't be able to. Isn't that -- isn't that transporting it in order to conceal, to conceal it?",
  "I don't understand that, so I hope you will explain it later. It doesn't mean anything if it's not a detection statute.",
  "He puts it in his shoe, okay. Because it's a lot, he puts it in his shoe.",
  "That would be enough, wouldn't it?",
  "And you're basically confronting face-on the dissent here, which drew a distinction between transporting to conceal and concealing to transport. And all you have here is concealing to transport, and the question is whether that violates the statute. I agree with Justice Breyer that if this is a statute directed at concealing to transport, it's a funny name for it to think that it's a money laundering statute.",
  "Everybody knows he's a drug dealer, back in Juarez or wherever he lives in Mexico.",
  "He's famous in town. He's a well respected man because he's a big drug dealer. And he has just arranged get the money delivered to him so that he can spend it. What -- what's concealing there?",
  "It won't be disguised.",
  "Just to be clear, you affirmatively say that concealing to transport is enough, right?",
  "There's no principle that all criminal statutes have to cover every -- every bad act. Maybe Congress has left a gap. I'm willing to entertain the possibility that this individual, obviously doing something very bad, doesn't -- falls between the two stools. He is neither guilty under the taking currency out of the country statute because he didn't know of the existence of the statute, and he's not guilty under one because he was not transporting to conceal but was concealing to transport. And so there's a gap. The Justice Department can certainly get that gap filled readily enough. I don't know why we should torture either one of the statutes to close it.",
  "If you're trying to prevent the money - -",
  "What if --- if that's what they're concerned about, taking the money out of the country, why do they have the concealment requirement? They could have just said, you know, if you take dirty money out of the country you're guilty.",
  "They didn't say that. They have a concealment -- I can't understand why, if the money is hidden during the transportation, it's any worse than when the money is not hidden during the transportation. It isn't -- it isn't the hiding during the transportation they're concerned about. The statute doesn't make any sense that way.",
  "I forget what it was that I didn't understand.",
  "Mr. Beard, can't you give us something we can get this guy on?",
  "He's carrying dirty money. It even smells of drugs.",
  "Can't we get him as an accessory to drug dealing or something? You say he has to walk?",
  "Mr. Phillips, what if the statute didn't have that provision, but it just said you can bring a State tort action when the conditions approved by the FDA for the marketing of this drug have not been complied with? That's all it says. Now, would you knowledge that that -- that that suit could be brought?",
  "It's a duty that is defined by the FDA. And I didn't hear your answer. Would that suit be allowable or not?",
  "It doesn't seem to me - - what I worry about is that if we say in this case it treads too much into the FDA's own responsibility to say what material should have been provided to the FDA, it seems to me the next what could be more central to the FDA -- to the FDA's job than determining whether the conditions the FDA prescribed for the marketing of the drug have indeed been observed? That's central as well.",
  "But one can also reason in the opposite direction; that is to say, one can know from the medical devices portion of the FDA that Congress has no objection to private tort actions that -- where the medical device manufacturer has not observed the requirements that the FDA's approval impose, right? We know from that section that Congress has no objection to that there. You can probably guess that Congress has no objection to it in the -- in the drug field as well as the medical devices field. And if I make that guess, what is so different about having a jury second-guess the provision of information portion?",
  "Well, It is -- it is more of a stick in the eye of the Federal Government to create a cause of action that consists of defrauding the Federal Government, which is what was at issue in Buckman. The very cause of action was providing false information to the FDA. Here the cause of action is a standard tort cause of action for marketing a defective product.",
  "What about the defense itself, which says that the defense is available if not only the drug was approved for safety and efficacy, but also if the drug and its labeling were in compliance with the FDA's approval at the time the drug left the control of the manufacturer?",
  "Is it wrong to say that that's -- you know, that that's interfering with the FDA's bailiwick?",
  "Are you going to let a jury decide that?",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "It was decided by the Sixth Circuit, wasn't it?",
  "I assume -- I assume -- you don't stop between sentences, so I hate to interrupt you.",
  "I assume that if this drug were still on the market, you could bring forward the information that you have alluded to about the withholding of necessary data by Warner-Lambert, and the FDA would certainly be able to consider that and decide whether sanctions were necessary, withdrawing of the drug was necessary. In this case, the drug has already been withdrawn. So I assume the FDA has at least a reduced incentive to go into these questions. I guess they still would want to go into them if Warner-Lambert were really a bad actor. They could impose some sanctions, couldn't they, even though the drug was already withdrawn?",
  "Do you think we could have two different rules: One for drugs that are still out there and one for drugs that have since been withdrawn? Because I frankly see little incentive for the FDA, you know, to go back over past mistakes. The drug now having been withdrawn, it doesn't matter. But if the drug was still out there, it seems to me you could come forward, and I would be much less sympathetic to what you're trying to do. You could trust the FDA to do the job.",
  "No, but once it sanctions the Plaintiff, the Government can't make the argument you are interfering; you are second-guessing the FDA. The FDA would have said: You didn't give us information that was necessary; and had we known this, we wouldn't have gone ahead.",
  "What's the Sixth Circuit case? It must have involved this, no?",
  "I see. What is your position on severability? Why shouldn't we -- you know, we usually accept the circuit court's determination as to what the State law is. Michigan is in the Sixth Circuit. And I think it's overwhelmingly likely that the Second Circuit would defer to the Sixth Circuit's view. Don't you think?",
  "Well, unless they choose not to change their mind. I mean, they did say that they're bound by this by Garcia as to questions of State law.",
  "They said that: We are bound by Garcia as to questions of State law.",
  "You're saying, in addition to being a claim, that's not enough reliability? It has to be a claim that's presented to the government?",
  "And all that (c) does is tell you what a claim is. So that, even if it's not a claim against the government but just a claim against a subcontractor, that still can be the basis for liability so long as it's presented to the government.",
  "Does the other side concede that point, that you have to prove loss to the government? I don't think they do, do they?",
  "I don't think they do.",
  "You could say that the missed funds which are in the hands of subcontract -- of contractors, harms the government, even though it doesn't come out of the government's pocket, because those funds were given for a particular purpose, and if that purpose is frustrated, the government is harmed. That would work, without saying that the government has lost any money.",
  "Well, suppose the government gives money for building schools, okay, to a State and a fraudulent claim is submitted as -- in connection with the construction of the school. The government has been cheated in that the money it gave for a school is not going to the school; some of it is going into the hands of the fraudulent contractor.",
  "I understand that, but that's a different point.",
  "I am talking now about the point of whether the government itself has to suffer any harm other than the fact that the money it gave was not used for the purpose for which it gave it. That alone, it seems to me, could be harm.",
  "Am I correct in this that without the claim definition, the statute would not cover a fraudulent submission by the subcontractor to the contractor which is known to be passed on to the government ultimately?",
  "Without that definition, the claim would be made against the contractor, not against the government.",
  "And, therefore, wouldn't be a claim.",
  "I have another question. Suppose the subcontractor -- the fraud consists of inflating the hours spent in a cost-plus contract. So the subcontractor submits and receives payment for $10,000 more than the subcontractor deserved. All right? But that all comes out of the hide of the contractor. The contractor gets the same amount of money from the Federal Government and the fraud only harms the contractor.",
  "That would not be - -",
  "Why?",
  "A hundred dollars more a can.",
  "He has to know that. He has to know that his bill is going to be sent up the line to the government. \"Knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record to get a false or fraudulent - -",
  "And if he knows it, serve him right. But this other guy thinks he's just honestly cheating the guy who's buying the chemicals.",
  "It doesn't shock me. I don't know. It doesn't shock me at all. If indeed the object of this is to prevent fraud upon the government and if the government has not been deceived at all, get yourself a new statute.",
  "This statute doesn't have to cover every ill in the world.",
  "But if injuring the Federal Government would -- it would suffice to injure the Federal Government that the schools are shoddy and the roofs are leaking? That would be enough?",
  "Even though the Federal Government is not out of pocket any more, but the program that it -- that it was desirous of encouraging is simply not as good as it would have been otherwise.",
  "I thought - -",
  "I thought it was not established that anything from this defendant got to the Navy.",
  "Well, where in the record is there some indication that some -- some paper from - - with a fraudulent representation made it up to the Navy?",
  "Well, I know what certificates are, I mean, you know, their general content. But was there anything in the record that a certificate from Allison went to the Navy with Allison's signature on it?",
  "Well, then there's less to this case than we had thought. My goodness, even under the Petitioner's theory, you win. If indeed a fraudulent document was given to Bath and Bath passed that on, I think the Petitioners would have conceded - -",
  "-- that there's a cause of action. What is all this fuss about, then?",
  "I wish you had said that in your brief because we could have saved ourselves a lot of reading.",
  "And whose -- whose contract required this? It's a strange provision to be in the contract between Allison and Bath.",
  "And that contract between Allison and Bath said that this certificate from Allison had to be presented to the Navy?",
  "And Bath would have been in breach of its contract with Allison unless it passed these things on to the Navy? That's why I say it's a strange provision to be in the contract between Bath and Allison.",
  "Allison could sue Bath for not passing the certificate on to the Navy?",
  "Did you make this point in response to the petition for cert?",
  "Well, you know, usually we take a case to decide the question presented; and if this question is really not before us you should have told us that.",
  "And we thought so in Prentice.",
  "Well, I had not understood you to concede that -- that the land rule was different from the maritime rule. I gather that in many States it's the same as what you assert the maritime rule to be.",
  "Which was a land case.",
  "You would say one of those factors is the Clean Water Act, wouldn't you?",
  "Even if it is not pre-emptive as a matter of law, it's one of the factors that you can bring to the Court's attention, I suppose.",
  "In respect, I mean, the janitor has authority over an aspect of the corporation. I mean, surely, that can't be the test.",
  "I assume the test is the person has to be high enough that it justifies holding the entire corporation. And I doubt whether a captain is -- is high enough. How many of these units does Exxon have?",
  "Twenty vessels.",
  "I thought the Lake Shore - - well, I thought the Lake Shore and Amiable whatever it is principle was that a captain ain't one of those. The captain doesn't -- doesn't do the job.",
  "That, and $3.5 billion.",
  "What about -- what about looking to the Clean Water Act? And I wanted to ask you this question about the Act. Assuming we agree with you that -- that it was too late to raise the Clean Water Act as a separate pre-emptive factor in the case, why was it too late in the appellate court to raise the Clean Water Act as an additional reason why maritime law should not be interpreted to allow punitive damages and, in part 3 of the case, as a factor, why punitive damages of the amount at issue here should not be allowed? It seems to me there it's not a new argument. It's just an additional factor for arguments that have already been made.",
  "Yes. That's part 3. What about part 2? Why -- why can't the Petitioner raise the argument or why could not the Petitioner raise it in the court of appeals? Okay, we agree that the Clean Water Act does not pre-empt the granting of punitive damages here, but one of the factors that we ought to take into account in deciding whether modern admiralty law in this situation permits punitive damages is the existence of the Clean Water Act. That's not a pre-emption thing. Is that also waived, do you think?",
  "They don't have to make every tiny little argument. I mean, you can think of additional points on appeal so long as it's under the same major heading. And the major heading here is not the Clean Water Act pre-empts punitive damages; the major heading is, rather, modern admiralty law does not permit. And, you know, they had made other arguments about prior cases; they had talked about State law; and this is just another argument: By the way, here's another one. There's the Clean Water Act.",
  "It's close.",
  "But it doesn't really say pre-emption, and so it's -- it's just another factor to consider when you decide what the evolving law of admiralty requires.",
  "Is there anything else in the estate?",
  "How much of an interest does the estate have if it is all going to be claimed by -- by these private plaintiffs?",
  "Counsel, what does unfairness have to do with it? I mean the whole doctrine of sovereign immunity rests upon unfairness. It says you can't sue the sovereign even if you have a valid claim. And when we say we will apply the same doctrine as to foreign sovereigns, it means the same thing. I'm just not terribly persuaded by the fact that it has unfair consequences. The doctrine of sovereign immunity always has unfair consequences. So, unless you're asking us to abandon the doctrine, the fairness argument does not persuade me.",
  "Or the incarceration. Would your case be different if after the magistration the -- your client was free to go? The court said, you know, this is what you've been arrested for and charged with by the policeman who brought you in; we'll -- you know, good-bye. Whereas in this case, he was required to make bail. Suppose he hadn't been required to make bail, supposing he was free to go?",
  "Right.",
  "So Texas -- assuming we agree with that, Texas made one of two possible constitutional violations. Either it was unconstitutional for Texas to require him to make bail, or it was unconstitutional for Texas not to provide him with an attorney. Why should -- why should we find that the latter was the problem rather than the former?",
  "Well, there certainly is if you're not charged. I think it's a very strong point in your favor that he was required to make bail, because I don't think you can hold somebody without charging him, just say, you know --",
  "The fact -- the fact that he was held suggests that he was charged with something.",
  "Sure.",
  "So maybe, maybe Texas was wrong about that, that it shouldn't have required bail. Maybe that was what was unconstitutional, rather than its failure to provide counsel.",
  "Why doesn't it solve your -- the problem that you're obviously wrestling with, if -- if we simply said there is a right to counsel, but it doesn't attach until there's a significant stage of the prosecution which then follows? I mean, if you have some proceeding afterwards, yes, then you do need a lawyer, but the mere fact that you've been brought to the courthouse and made bail and let go does not require 500 counsel to be provided. Only -- only when there is some later proceeding, which is an essential part of the prosecution, must you have counsel.",
  "Why wouldn't that solve the problem?",
  "That's fine, but --",
  "But you only need counsel at significant phases.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes, but it's so wrapped up with how we decide this case. I mean, if I think that counsel has to be appointed right away for -- for Justice Breyer's 500 demonstrators, I'm going to give a different answer to the first question. But if I know that counsel doesn't have to be appointed until the prosecution proceeds to some significant phase where an attorney would be -- would be really helpful, then -- then I can -- I can be quite more sympathetic to your -- to your argument.",
  "And that stage would arise immediately as soon as the magistration was completed, right?",
  "He'd have to have counsel appointed immediately --",
  "-- to advise him whether to ask for this hearing or not.",
  "Do you know any other case in which we've held that it's a critical stage of the proceeding where nothing has happened, but something could have happened if the defendant had asked for it?",
  "I don't -- I find it hard to describe that as a critical stage of the proceeding.",
  "When the trial occurs, it is a critical stage.",
  "I have no doubt.",
  "But you're claiming that his decision of whether to ask for that or not is a critical stage. And I just don't know any precedent for saying that something that hasn't happened is a critical stage.",
  "What authority do you have to hold somebody who's not been charged? I mean I don't understand that. You say he hasn't been charged, but we're going to hold you in jail. That's very strange.",
  "No counsel right would attach? No counsel right would attach?",
  "I think it's a problem even if you appoint counsel. You say you can keep people without charging them so long as you give them counsel?",
  "Mr. Coleman, what happens in other jurisdictions? I probably ought to know this, but I don't. Maybe you do. When you don't have a procedure called magistration, but someone is taken before a magistrate and with the prosecutor present, is the indictment at that point drawn up, or doesn't the -- doesn't the prosecutor have some time to decide what the indictment ought to contain? What -- what happens at that point?",
  "So what happens in the interim? Is he -- is he charged in the interim, or is he just held because he is going to be charged, which is what's going on here.",
  "I don't see how there's any, any, any contradiction between reading the second clause as a -- as a personal guarantee and reading the first one as assuring the existence of a militia, not necessarily a State-managed militia because the militia that resisted the British was not State- managed. But why isn't it perfectly plausible, indeed reasonable, to assume that since the framers knew that the way militias were destroyed by tyrants in the past was not by passing a law against militias, but by taking away the people's weapons -- that was the way militias were destroyed. The two clauses go together beautifully: Since we need a militia, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.",
  "Blackstone thought it was important. Blackstone thought it was important. He thought the right of self-defense was inherent, and the framers were devoted to Blackstone. Joseph Story, the first commentator on the Constitution and a member of this Court, thought it was a personal guarantee.",
  "They got nothing at all, not everything they wanted. They got nothing at all. So long as it was up to the Federal Government to regulate the militia and to assure that they were armed, the Federal Government could, could disband the State militias.",
  "So what, what was the function served by the Second Amendment as far as the militia is concerned?",
  "And as I recall the legislation against Scottish highlanders and against - - against Roman Catholics did use the term -- forbade them to keep and bear arms, and they weren't just talking about their joining militias; they were talking about whether they could have arms.",
  "Mr. Dellinger, let's come back to your description of the opinion below as allowing armor-piercing bullets and machine guns. I didn't read it that way. I thought the opinion below said it had to be the kind of weapon that was common for the people - -",
  "-- that is common for the people to have. And I don't know -- I don't know that a lot of people have machine guns or armor-piercing bullets. I think that's quite unusual. But having a pistol is not unusual.",
  "How many people in the country?",
  "I don't think it's common.",
  "Or a law on the carrying of concealed weapons, which would include pistols, of course.",
  "It means \"well trained,\" doesn't it?",
  "Doesn't \"well regulated\" mean \"well trained\"? It doesn't mean -- it doesn't mean \"massively regulated.\" It means \"well trained.\"",
  "Wasn't -- wasn't it the case that the banning of arms on the part of the Scottish highlanders and of Catholics in England used the term, forbade them to \"bear arms\"? It didn't mean that could just not join militias; it meant they couldn't carry arms.",
  "The freedom of speech that was referred to in the Constitution was also \"the\" freedom of speech, which referred to the pre-existing freedom of speech. And there were indeed some restrictions on that such as libel that you were not allowed to do. And yet we've never held that simply because it was pre-existing and that there were some regulations upon it, that we would not use strict scrutiny. We certainly apply it to freedom of speech, don't we?",
  "Like libel.",
  "I don't understand that. What would that be -- that you can, if you have time, when you hear somebody crawling in your -- your bedroom window, you can run to your gun, unlock it, load it and then fire? Is that going to be the exception?",
  "But that opinion also, it didn't use the militia prologue to say it's only the kind of weapons that would be useful in militia, and that are commonly -- commonly held today. Is there any Federal exclusion of weapons that applies to weapons that are commonly held today? I don't know what you're worried about. Machine guns, what else? Armored bullets, what else?",
  "But that passage doesn't mean once it's an arm in the dictionary definition of arms. Once it's an arm in the specialized sense that the opinion referred to it, which is -- which is the type of a weapon that was used in militia, and it is - - it is nowadays commonly held.",
  "If you read it that way, I don't see why you have a problem.",
  "Talk a little slower; I'm not following you.",
  "You want to say yes.",
  "That's your answer.",
  "Which shows that maybe you're being unrealistic in thinking that the second clause is not broader than the first. It's not at all uncommon for a legislative provision or a constitutional provision to go further than is necessary for the principal purpose involved. The principal purpose here is the militia, but the -- but the second clause goes beyond the militia and says the right of the people to keep and bear arms. Now, you may say the kind of arms is colored by the militia. But it speaks of the right of the people. So why not acknowledge that it's -- it's broader than the first clause?",
  "You don't even agree that Massachusetts was subject to the Second Amendment.",
  "But the time we're talking about, the firearms in the home ordinance, when was that?",
  "It's useful for such purposes as what \"keep and bear arms\" means and things of that sort.",
  "They certainly didn't want to preserve the kind of militia that America had, which was a militia separate from the state, separate from the government, which enabled the revolt against the British.",
  "You wouldn't put it that way. You would just say it is not being infringed if reasonable limitations are placed upon it.",
  "All the more reason to allow a homeowner to have a handgun.",
  "You turn on, you turn on the lamp next to your bed so you can -- you can turn the knob at 3-22-95, and so somebody - -",
  "You mean you can't have any more arms than you would need to take with you to the militia? You can't have a -- you can't have a -- you know, a turkey gun and a duck gun and a 30.06 and a 270 and -- you know, different -- different hunting guns for different - -",
  "You can't do that? I mean a State could say you don't - -",
  "You can have to have a 12 gauge and that's it.",
  "Excuse me. The paralegals' rates would also be subject to the -- to the cap.",
  "They couldn't go above the cap.",
  "Okay.",
  "Indeed, would insist.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, agent fees - -",
  "I mean, the problem exists whether or not you make paralegal fees attorney's fees, because agent fees are also subject to the same cap.",
  "And agents were paid a good deal less than that.",
  "This problem is going to exist anyway, isn't it? I mean, even if you don't cram paralegals into the other expenses, there are going to be other expenses that are in the other expenses.",
  "You're going to have to have this same problem -- and what about the overhead and so forth?",
  "Am I to understand, you claim that even if they are expenses, they should - - they should be paid for at market rate, don't you?",
  "Of course, that's no loss to the government because when you put it into the lawyer's rate, you hit the ceiling for the lawyer's rate that much sooner.",
  "It seems like that would be --",
  "Right.",
  "Do you know of any other case where we used -- I mean it just gets worse and worse. Do you know any other case where we've used the legislative history of a vetoed bill to determine the meaning of a later bill that was not vetoed?",
  "Good. What is it?",
  "When was that?",
  "Yes.",
  "Never mind. Don't take - - don't waste your time.",
  "When you have a -- you can submit it a letter. I've looked in your brief, I can't find this Jean case that you mentioned on use of veto. I have a certain morbid interest in it.",
  "Why do you say the labor policy promotes it? It certainly permits it, but what -- what - -",
  "No, I'm talking about the -- the Federal policy. You say the Federal policy promotes this employer speech. Why do you say it promotes it? It clearly permits it. It clearly does not discourage it, but is that the same as promoting it?",
  "Even if he guesses right, he is subject to the litigation.",
  "You said if he guesses wrong, he is subject to litigation. He is subject to the litigation even if he guesses right.",
  "Why do you say it's a very different case Mr. Hungar? I don't really understand it.",
  "It was labor policy. I mean, you have to acknowledge it was labor policy in these other cases, just a different labor policy that the Federal Government wanted, right?",
  "Right.",
  "But the - -",
  "The difference between this and Rust is that the Federal Government in Rust was assuredly following a Federal policy.",
  "But it was a Federal policy that the Federal Government had every right to implement. We do not want to support abortions.",
  "The issue here is whether the policy that California is trying to implement - - namely, we do not want the employer to -- in its view - - disrupt the -- the labor management relations by -- by opposing union -- unionization.",
  "That -- that is the issue, whether that is a policy that California can -- can implement.",
  "Why? Because it's wasting the money or because that is their - -",
  "-- their labor policy?",
  "Just like -- like Gould. I mean, there is a case where a State used State money, no contracting with any -- with any company that's been convicted of unfair labor practices three times. Strictly State contracting policy, we just don't want to spend our money dealing with such a person.",
  "Why wouldn't that be the State's managing its own money? It's our money.",
  "We just don't want to deal with people who oppose unions.",
  "I think your reason for not paying for this activity is that you don't like this activity.",
  "I call that -- I call that regulating the activity.",
  "Well, you allow the employer to engage in all other employee relations, and you're willing -- that can be done without -- the one thing the employer can't do is speak out against the union. This isn't because you don't - -",
  "Well, the question of when the contract is done is different from the question of when the money is paid.",
  "He is asking with when the money is paid.",
  "You're not going to go through all of these one by one, are you?",
  "Let me ask you a basic question that doesn't require you to get into one by one. Suppose you have a State that doesn't want to have its money used to assist unions. This is an antiunion State and it adopts the same kind of law that you have. And it simply says, none of -- none of this State's - - yes, you can recognize unions if you like, but none of the money that we give you - -",
  "-- shall be used -- shall be used for collective bargaining or for any -- any activities involving unions.",
  "Same. Yes.",
  "To the employer. No employer getting money from the State can expend any of our money -- the same way yours is -- in collective bargaining with unions or in anything else. Now, we are not stopping employers from doing that. We just don't like unions, and it's our money and we don't want this employer to use it for unions. Would that be all right.",
  "Why does that -- why does that make a difference? If it violates Federal policy, it violates Federal policy. Livadas said you can't do it because it violates Federal policy, which is to favor unionization, and not to deter.",
  "You could say the same about that other one.",
  "So does the statute I posit. Just don't use State money. You can use all of your own money to deal with unions; just we don't want our money used for it.",
  "That clearly would be banned and I don't see why yours is any different.",
  "You say there are other examples where a -- a noun that is nested in another definition is separately defined and the two are read together. How are those phrased? I mean, I could understand what you say if this provision here read \"The term 'felony drug offense' means a felony that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.\" Then I'd go back to the \"felony\" definition for what a felony means, but it doesn't repeat the \"felony.\" \"The term 'felony drug offense' means an offense that is punishable by imprisonment for\" -- do any of the examples of nesting that you -- that you bring forward read this way?",
  "Which ones are they? Where are they - -",
  "And - -",
  "Where would we find this?",
  "I don't -- the definitional section contradicts -- contradicts what's in (b)(1)(A).",
  "Yes. It contradicts it because the \"felony\" definition is classified as felony by Federal or State law.",
  "Which is \"under any provision of this subchapter or any other Federal law that prohibits or restricts.\" And then in the last part, \"under any law of a\" -- of \"State\" -- it picks up \"State\" -- \"or a foreign country.\" \"Foreign country\" is not included in 802(13).",
  "So you have to say that there \"felony\" stands on its own, right?",
  "You think -- you think it would mean something different if you just left out the \"regardless of\" clause?",
  "The \"prior adult Federal or State conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,\" you think it means something different without the \"regardless\".",
  "Not at all? Not possibly.",
  "I would say that \"regardless\" clause is extraordinary and I would not want to have to deal with such prolix statutes on a regular basis.",
  "How many statutes exist like that, my goodness? You want the government to be held in all statutes to a level that is clear enough to satisfy the clear statement - -",
  "That's what the rule of lenity means.",
  "Do our cases reflect what you're saying? I thought our cases on the rule of lenity say that where there is an ambiguity you give the tie to the defendant.",
  "Mr. Jay, is the government running with the fox and chasing with the hounds? You want us to apply the provisions governing the Internal Revenue Code with regard to whether the statute has expired, but when it comes to interest you say oh, no, no, no, that doesn't apply. Why? Why shouldn't the two go pari passu, as we say?",
  "Oh, yes, they make the same mistake, but that doesn't justify your making the same, the same mistake.",
  "I mean, it's either, you know, they're both in one pot or they're both in the other pot. And both sides want to -- want to split them up, but why don't they go together?",
  "Right. I thought you were making a second argument, that even if they were entitled to it despite the statute, they wouldn't be entitled to interest. You don't make that claim?",
  "I see.",
  "Right.",
  "Right. Right. Okay.",
  "Plus interest.",
  "I'm not certain it was valid if this coal was not shipped overseas. You're putting an awful burden on the government to know when the coal is severed and shipped. You're saying if they mistake a shipment as being only for domestic use rather than for shipment abroad, they don't have any basis whatever for the tax claim. I'm not sure I agree with.",
  "Why is the Export Clause so, so significant? The only other self-executing constitutional clause that provides for damages automatically that comes to mind is the Takings Clause. And we have allowed the states to require claimants to jump through innumerable hoops. They have to exhaust all their administrative remedies before they can bring a suit here. Why -- why is the Export Clause any -- any more sacrosanct?",
  "Volenti non fit injuria. If indeed the taxpayer pays out the money for an unconstitutional export tax, it seems to me that person has no claim until he complies with the administrative procedures that render that tax unconstitutional. But up until the point where he is paying it voluntarily, it seems to me there is no constitutional violation.",
  "I'm not saying it has to be made at the moment they pay their taxes. I'm just saying until it's made there is no unconstitutional, unconstitutional export tax.",
  "Wait what very narrow exception? It didn't apply the exception.",
  "Don't the two go together? If you could bring an injunction action, surely you don't have to pay the tax.",
  "Well, that's what she is saying. She is saying that those conditions exist here. That this is not -- not a plausible tax; and, therefore, she could have gotten an injunction; and, therefore, by a parity of reasoning, she doesn't have to go through the tax provisions.",
  "Well, you could say the same about the tax on oleomargarine. It is a perfectly valid tax but not when you impose it on nuts. And here the tax on coal is a perfectly valid tax, but not when you impose it on coal that's in the stream of export.",
  "Are there any other district cases that require preclearance except those that redistrict the, the State?",
  "There is a law to be cleared if you -- if you assume that the existence of a law to be cleared occurs before that law has been tested in the courts. In the hypothetical we've been discussing, just as in this case, there was a State law and if you assume the State law is valid before it's gone through the judicial clearance process, there is a State law change when the clearance process results in striking down the law. I don't -- it seems to me that the two situations are pretty parallel.",
  "On the other hand, I can also see the attorney general saying: Why should I preclear it? It hasn't even been determined to be law in Alabama yet. Does the Justice Department preclear stuff that is -- that is in the midst of litigation?",
  "Where they are doing the districting or - -",
  "Do you know of any cases where -- where a piece of State legislation has been in the middle of litigation where the Justice Department has precleared it?",
  "It seems like an exercise in futility.",
  "It would have been able to be brought up here if it was based on a discriminatory intent, certainly.",
  "Do you agree that the lawsuit to invalidate it was filed as soon as was feasible?",
  "Why didn't the Alabama Supreme Court say that in this very case?",
  "Excuse me. I don't think -- I don't think I follow you that, as a matter of Alabama law, it went into effect. Just because the statute said it went into effect does not prove that it went into effect. I think the Alabama - -",
  "-- the Alabama Supreme Court would say it never went into effect because it was unconstitutional.",
  "That rule of law renders constitutional under State law an act that would otherwise not be constitutional.",
  "Well, that's what you're saying.",
  "You're saying that's the effect: It locks it in.",
  "Oh, but it can't go back.",
  "For the reason that, absent their coming up with a new law, what law would be in effect?",
  "What does the Alabama Supreme Court preclear? Where it was redistricting and it had a redistricting plan, I can see it would send over to the attorney general the new redistricting plan. What -- what do the justices of the Alabama Supreme Court have to come before the attorney general to get his benediction upon?",
  "Do they submit their opinion and say, \"Mr. Attorney General, please approve our opinion\"?",
  "All right. What?",
  "Before the attorney general, you're talking about?",
  "No, no. First of all, you're trying to get -- the quick way is to get it from the attorney general.",
  "I understand. What was supposed -- what should have been submitted to the attorney general? What is the Alabama Supreme Court's - -",
  "Do you have any problem with the republican form of government provision of the Constitution?",
  "As I understand what's going on here, the -- the legislative process of the people of Alabama, whereby something is invalid as a law, suddenly becomes a law because the Federal attorney general has given it preclearance. The people have never voted for that properly under their Constitution. Yet, it becomes law in Alabama. And that's a republican form of government?",
  "From an Alabama law that had never been adopted by the people of Alabama?",
  "Not validated, so - -",
  "Mr. Shanmugan, what does the attorney general do when he gets -- I mean, does he just preclear any old thing that somebody shoves under his nose? Does he look to see whether there is litigation pending on it? Was this litigation pending when it was - -",
  "-- the plan was submitted - -",
  "A lynch mob doesn't require investigation by American courts of the internal workings of a foreign government.",
  "No, but I think it would be quite extraordinary to investigate the Government of Iraq. That's a matter that the executive can take into account.",
  "But It would be a strange thing for an American court to do.",
  "Mr. Margulies, the prologue to the Constitution does say \"to preserve the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.\" There is something to the notion, isn't there, that the Constitution provides constitutional rights, including the right to the writ of habeas corpus, to Americans or to anyone who is in America; but to say that the whole world has rights under the Constitution is extravagant.",
  "Mr. Margulies, could I ask a few questions about the Multinational Force involved here? Do you acknowledge that in theory, at least, the United States in its capacity here is subject to the control of the United Nations?",
  "You do not?",
  "Who says? I mean, a transfer is one thing and saying you're free to go and the Iraqi government picks him up is something else. Why -- why do you equate the two?",
  "But -- of course it can.",
  "It can, but - -",
  "Well, why do you say it has nothing to do with the war, then? They are holding them as security detainees. Aren't they -- aren't they worried that if they just let them go, they'll go right back to killing Americans and Iraqis?",
  "I'm not arguing that. I'm just questioning your statement that it's irrelevant that this is occurring in a war zone. It is not at all irrelevant. One of the -- the reason they're being detained is precisely because this is a war zone.",
  "Do you think an eight-hour lead is enough? I don't know.",
  "It would make a good movie.",
  "General, could -- could Congress pass a law that said if you wear a wristwatch during the commission of any crime, you get another 10 years?",
  "Surely it depends on what the felony is. If the felony is the filing of a dishonest tax return and -- and you have a can of gasoline with you when you mail the letter, it seems to me quite as absurd as saying wearing a wristwatch in the course of a felony. That's what troubles me about this. I'm -- I'm tempted to -- I think everybody is tempted to distort the \"during\" to -- to mean something else, simply because the consequences of performing a completely lawful act wearing a wristwatch, carrying explosives -- given the broad definition of explosives, I guess it would include having -- having some cartridges, explosive cartridges?",
  "That's perfectly lawful, and you get another 10 years for it just because you're -- you're mailing a letter to the IRS at the same time.",
  "This isn't a very good case. If you wanted to bring a really absurd case, you could have picked a better one than this, because there really is something of a connection.",
  "You're saying it should have said \"during which\"?",
  "\"During the commission of which the explosive was used or carried\"?",
  "Including the policeman who had cartridges in his gun, presumably, right?",
  "You could say it is not a question on which we grant certiorari.",
  "Yes, you got it anyway.",
  "Could I ask you about the \"in which,\" the \"in which\" thing? It has just occurred to me that \"in which\" is in a very sloppy clause anyway, because it says \"shall run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment, including that imposed for the felony in which the explosive was used or carried.\" What about the fire? It omits fire entirely -- in which fire or the explosive. Fire or the explosive was used or the explosive was carried. It's a pretty sloppy job down at the end of (h), isn't it? So I wouldn't put a whole lot of weight on the \"in which\" given that the rest of it is so sloppy.",
  "If you are being very precise, but whoever wrote that was, obviously, not being very precise because he left out \"fire\" entirely.",
  "And maybe gunpowder doesn't include the little bit that's in a cartridge either. You think it does?",
  "Well, it was going to be -­ it was going to be inaccurate as to one or the other of one or two. If you said \"during,\" that would be -- that would be inaccurate as to one. And \"in\" is accurate as to one but inaccurate as to two. I guess they should have said \"in or during\" or \"in which.\" They should have added \"fire,\" too, right?",
  "But why is it necessary to have a special rule in order to prevent the trial from descending into a farce? Why couldn't you simply apply the same rule of competency that you apply for whether the defendant can be tried, and then if in fact his self-representation begins to turn the trial into a farce surely the court would have the power to prohibit his further self-representation. Certainly, turning a trial into a farce is a basis for the court's action; no?",
  "The problem with taint would be his own fault. I can't imagine that he would success on appeal claiming he tainted the jury. And the advantage of waiting is that by waiting to see if in fact he will turn the trial into a farce you avoid the risk of depriving him of his right to represent himself, which is certainly a very important constitutional right. Why didn't you wait to see whether he's going to be able to pull it off or not?",
  "Well, there must be precedents. I'm sure under the old rule, if I can recall it the old rule, where you have a single standard for both the right to be tried -- the -- the ability to be tried and the right to represent yourself, there must have been instances in which the person who was representing himself was unable to cope and the trial was -- was turning into a farce. There must have been instances. What did they do?",
  "Proceeds, that's what I thought.",
  "What is your test that you're going to apply ex ante? Whether he's able to coherently - -",
  "Yes, what's the test?",
  "Cannot communicate coherently? I sometimes -- I sometimes think that the lawyers cannot communicate coherently.",
  "It's really a vague test, isn't it?",
  "But surely his total ignorance of all of the trial rules, the hearsay rule and the other details of conducting a trial, is a great disadvantage. But we allow him to toss that away so long as he knows he's tossing it away. That the judge instructs him: You're ill-advised to proceed on your own; you're not a lawyer; this is, you know, a complicated process; are you sure you want to represent yourself? And if he says yes, we say, well, you know, you've brought it on yourself. Why can't we say the same thing about his supposed inability to communicate effectively, unless and until he turns the trial into a farce?",
  "What would the standard of review be? I'm a reviewing court. The judge has not allowed this person to represent himself. What's the standard of review? Abuse of discretion or what?",
  "Abuse of discretion?",
  "And what's your test, the same test: Inability to communicate no matter how idiotic? I mean this man is living in a fantasy world. He understands that he's on trial, but his whole world is just -- he not only believes in Martians, he thinks we are all Martians, or something like that. I mean - -",
  "Why pick on just the ability to communicate? It seems to me there are a lot of defects that can turn the trial into a farce.",
  "Do you worry at all that if we adopt a separate test for the ability to represent yourself, that the inevitable effect will be for the test for being able to be tried to become less and less rigorous?",
  "After all, there's no harm done so long as the person can't -- is not allowed to represent himself. I think there may be some value in linking the two, so that -- so that the court knows that if he finds the individual capable of being tried, he may have to begin a trial with this individual representing himself.",
  "If it gets to be bad, the court can terminate it and say, you know, you can't represent yourself. We're going to bring in counsel.",
  "Sure, it could be done if the trial is, indeed, turning into a farce.",
  "Well, why not just change the rule about what you can do, once the trial is under way? You say sometimes it's not a farce. It's just that this person is obviously incapable of making a coherent defense. Why not wait to see? What I object to in the proposal is making these judgments ex ante on the basis of -- I don't know -- psychological testing or past behavior or anything else. Give it a try. The person wants to represent himself. It's his constitutional right. If, indeed, it turns out that this is turning into a sham, fine, bring in a lawyer to represent him. But doing it beforehand on the basis of your prediction as to what the trial is going to turn into seems to me not to give enough respect to an individual's desire to represent himself.",
  "When you say they have their choice, you meant they have the choice of elevating the standard that applies to the competency to stand trial if they wish?",
  "Are there any psychiatric studies that show how accurate psychiatric studies are?",
  "That -- that estimate, for example, how accurately one can predict whether a particular defendant will indeed be able to defend himself?",
  "I didn't think so.",
  "You don't just have a record in open court. You have the experience of a trial in the past.",
  "That's more than just the stuff that was on the record. You've had the experience of a trial.",
  "Why do you concede that if the trial is not disruptive, the mere fact that this fellow is making an incompetent defense or, indeed, may be making no sense is justification for terminating the trial? I mean, this person can plead guilty if he wishes and that's perfectly okay. Can he not take the lesser step of putting forward an incompetent defense? The State is still going to have to plead - - to prove beyond a reasonable doubt before the case goes to the jury that he committed the crime that he's accused of, beyond a reasonable doubt. And I don't know why the mere fact that his defense is incompetent or even is making no sense would justify -- if that's what he wants to do instead of pleading guilty, that's, it seems to me, what the right of an individual consists of.",
  "Right.",
  "Your position is it has to be disruptive. If it's not disruptive, even if he's making no sense, that's his choice, right?",
  "Except, as you say, we don't know whether he was on his medication or not.",
  "Mr. Fisher, what if the defendant here promised to sit silent during the trial as the defendant did in Godinez? Would that be -- would that render everything okay?",
  "But, he could certainly sit silent. Having decided to represent himself, he could, if he wished, just sit silent.",
  "Maybe he writes badly.",
  "How fair does a trial seem to the public where the defendant stands up and says, Your Honor, I want to represent myself? I do not want this attorney. I want to defend myself. And the judge said, sit down, we have a psychological evaluation of you. You can't represent yourself. How fair does that seem to the public?",
  "I mean, you could say this was Congress, right?",
  "That's what the whole case is about.",
  "He wants a reason why that might be. Do you know many instances in which Congress has set up a system in which you cannot determine whether a State tax is valid or invalid until some future event at an indeterminate time which may be three years later? Is that customary - -",
  "-- for someone not to know whether the tax is payable or not for sure until three years later?",
  "Isn't that a good reason?",
  "What harm is done? Could you tell us in just a few words, what's the harm? That's what Justice Breyer's concerned about.",
  "What about the solvency of the person who has tentatively been declared exempt from your tax; so, therefore, you can't go get him right away? This is not the ordinary citizen. This is somebody who is on the edge of bankruptcy. You would normally want to get your money out of him as soon as possible before he squanders what is left, right?",
  "And would it -- would it not happen with some frequency that, even though you could have collected the tax three years earlier, by the time it turns out for sure that there's never going to be a Chapter 11 confirmation - -",
  "Mr. Makar, you were going to address, I take it, the assumption that Justice Breyer has asked you to make, which is that the language here is ambiguous. And your position is, I take it, that \"confirmed\" means \"confirmed\"?",
  "Sometimes don't they want the transfer to be effective whether or not there is a later confirmation? I thought that that was the assumption here: That some of these transfers they want to be effective whether or not a confirmation occurs later.",
  "Because you don't know whether that second one will ever be a sale under a plan, which is what the code requires. It has to be a transfer under a plan. And when it occurs, you don't know whether it is going to be an under plan or not.",
  "At the time it occurs it doesn't matter how you define the term. There is no way at the time it occurs to say that this is a transfer under a plan. There hasn't been a confirmed plan.",
  "It requires under a plan confirmed.",
  "It says \"a plan confirmed.\" How do you know at the time the transfer is made whether it is under a plan confirmed?",
  "You don't at all know.",
  "You would have no reason to know the answer to that question. You are not the State. The State has told us that millions of dollars have been lost in taxes not recovered.",
  "You missed the crucial - - the crucial part. The transfer has to be under a plan confirmed. I mean, that's the troublesome language. The transfer has to be under a plan confirmed.",
  "What is the section you mentioned earlier that uses \"under\" in a sense that clearly applies to pre-confirmation?",
  "I'm looking for it, and I can't - -",
  "Did you make that argument there?",
  "How does that provision read? Do you have it quoted here?",
  "It's always escrowed? Is that - -",
  "Is that a uniform practice?",
  "Could I?",
  "You know, we've said in other opinions no -- no statute pursues its purposes at all costs. And the limitations contained in a statute are as much a part of its purpose as the broad purpose that you just mentioned. I mean, if a -- if a \"plan confirmed\" means a plan confirmed, that limitation is part of the purpose no less than the broad purpose that you express.",
  "Maybe, but \"under a plan confirmed\" seems under normal interpretation of language to me to mean under a plan that has been confirmed.",
  "Is that spelled out somewhere in the -- is its text somewhere in these materials?",
  "Not the full, not the full section, though.",
  "Just little snippets of it.",
  "But that doesn't even comport with common-law civil cases. I mean, for a long time courts have allowed someone who's been euchred by a competitor's misrepresentations to his customers. An old New York case that was discussed in the briefs that I used to teach in contracts class, where he told somebody that the horse was no longer for sale and it was still for sale, and the person who wanted to sell the horse at the higher price should have -- to buy the horse should have had a cause of action, even though the representation was not made to him.",
  "Am I -- am I reading these provisions wrong? I thought you were proceeding in a 1961, and that the conspiracy -- the conspiracy provision is 1962(c).",
  "That's the conspiracy provision.",
  "I'm looking on page 2 of the Petitioner's brief. Have I -- have I been misinformed? The blue brief, page 2, maybe that's wrong, but that's what it says. It says 1962(c), it shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsections (a), (b) or (c).",
  "All right. I understand.",
  "Oh, I see, I see, I see. Okay.",
  "Why -- why is it -- I really worry about adopting a rule which would produce the result that whenever anyone makes a false statement in an official form, someone who is deprived of a business opportunity, or at least can say so, can bring a RICO action.",
  "Wait.",
  "Why couldn't you show - - why couldn't -- that's like the situation where a company runs a -- runs a lottery and in fact misrepresents what the odds are. And then you mean the people can't recover because they couldn't show that they would have won? It seems to me you can calculate the difference in the odds or something and place some value on that. Is it really painless to say, you know, I'm running a lottery and your chances of winning are one in a thousand, and everybody buys a ticket on that basis, and it turns out that really your chances are one in a million? Nobody has a cause of action because nobody can prove he would have won?",
  "That's all they can get? Just what they paid for the ticket?",
  "We've said that regulation does include regulation by adjudication for purposes of -- of Federal pre-emption laws. Why would it -- why would it be different for -- for Indian law.",
  "Yes, I understand, but I'm just talking about the first one now. You say it is not -- it is not regulation, right, under the first? And that's -- that's the only point I'm addressing. Why should regulation through a process of adjudication not be considered regulation for purposes of our Indian law where -- whereas, we have made clear in several cases that it does constitute regulation for purposes of Federal pre-emption under statutes that pre-empt state regulation?",
  "We could have said the same thing about the Congress. Congress just said -- just said \"regulation,\" and we interpreted that term to include common-law adjudication.",
  "You don't really mean \"actual consent\" by \"actual consent,\" right?",
  "Maybe you should use a different term, like \"implicit consent,\" maybe.",
  "Oh, so one of your answers to an earlier question suggests the same point that you now seem to be making, although I don't -- I don't recall it from your brief. Apparently you think that it would be different if this antidiscrimination law of the tribe had been set forth in a tribal ordinance. Is that right? Would you say your client could have been held to it if it had been written, rather than simply a -- a portion of tribal common law?",
  "That's not what I asked. That's not what I asked. I asked whether you would acknowledge that your client could be bound if it had been written.",
  "Well, that doesn't make any difference. We shouldn't place any weight on the fact that this was a common-law regulation, rather than regulation by a statute or ordinance. You can't have it both ways. It either makes a difference or it doesn't make a difference.",
  "But you just told me it didn't.",
  "You just told me that even if it were written down, you would still need what you think is express consent.",
  "Can a State distinguish when it grants a corporation status between non- Indian and Indian corporations.",
  "Wasn't part of the transaction the obtaining of back-up liability on the part of the individual Indians who, who owned the corporation? Didn't they guarantee the loan?",
  "No, but it does give the whole thing a decided flavor of dealing with, with Indians on the reservation. You're dealing with a corporation that, that's majority owned or entirely owned. Is it majority or entirely?",
  "Yes.",
  "And then you get guarantees from, on reservation Indians. It smells like dealing with Indians on the reservation to me. Of course, this certainty that you're -- that you're asking, your client could have obtained that certainly by inserting a choice of law provision providing that any disputes would be resolved somewhere else, couldn't it?",
  "In the absence of that, why should we bend over backwards to give something that has the smell of dealing with the Indians any other name? Your clients can fully protect themselves by a choice of forum provision.",
  "Is it a contract claim?",
  "Is it a contract claim? Was -- was -- was the claim a claim for discrimination in contracting so that it was part of the contract claim.",
  "It's a freestanding tort action, is that what it was?",
  "Wait. They are, they are not objecting to a -- to a general verdict. They are objecting to the fact that in their view, one of the elements of that -- of that general verdict is based upon what they assert is an invalid claim in the -- in the Indian court.",
  "I don't know that they waive that when they when -- when they allow a general verdict to go.",
  "If evidence supports any one of the claims contained in the general rule.",
  "The tribal court of appeals would have to be finding Federal law. It wouldn't be Indian law; it would be Federal law.",
  "You say they have adopted the Federal rules. So whatever the Federal law -- in other words, we would ask them to answer the question that you don't want us to answer.",
  "Certainly, your reliance upon the Federal rules doesn't impress me as much as it did when you first told me about it, because apparently the Federal rules mean whatever the tribal courts say they mean; is that right?",
  "And come to its own decision as to what they mean.",
  "And do we get special loan guarantees?",
  "Well, it has to be a known -- a known consensual relationship, for one thing. Wouldn't you add that requirement.",
  "He backed off on that. I pressed the point and - -",
  "Well, that may be; it depends on what you mean by \"tribal.\" I mean, it certainly would be rational to say that all disputes between members of the tribe can be resolved authoritatively by the tribal court, but it's quite a different thing to say that a dispute between a nonmember of the tribe and a member of the tribe can go to the tribal court. It's sort of the analogue to being home fried in a foreign State. It's -- is pretty close.",
  "Defendant, yes.",
  "You would add on the reservation? I mean - -",
  "If he walks into some town in South Dakota, the mere fact that you know he's an Indian -- it has to be on the reservation.",
  "Am I correct that the collateral here, the land, the land that was collateral was within the reservation but it was not Indian land.",
  "And you think that that's enough. It doesn't have to -- when you say \"on the reservation,\" you include as on the reservation land that is no longer owned by Indians but -- but is within the reservation boundaries.",
  "No, no, wait. You say that consensual relationship is not enough. If you enter into relationship with Indian in South Dakota on, you know -- in the State capital, that isn't enough. It has to be on the reservation. You acknowledge that. And for purposes of on the reservation, it's enough that you're dealing with land that is within the reservation even -- even if it is no longer Indian land?",
  "Well, you know this -- this provision 32(h), really doesn't -- does simply not work with post-Booker guidelines. You either have to say it was designed for a different regime, and therefore, has no effect now after Booker, or else you have to expand it beyond what it says, because may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified, under the mandatory guidelines, they were identified grounds for departure. And you had some -- the court could look at those and say, gee, am I going to pick one of these, if so I'll let him know. But you can depart now simply on the ground that you don't agree with the -- with what the Guidelines say as -- is that what you would call a ground of departure? It's simply a ground of disagreement, I would suppose. Why shouldn't we hold 32(h) simply. Simply has no -- no application under the new system? Or at least hold that all it applies to are departures within the meaning of the old mandatory guidelines system? Which is a much narrower category of departures.",
  "I don't think it is counter-intuitive to provide -- to -- to require notice when the number of grounds is finite. But if the number of grounds is infinite, I'm much less inclined to read it as even applicable to the situation.",
  "Post-Booker the guidelines are advisory, and the district judge has discretion as to the sentence. Now, in the bad old days, when the statute said 20 to 40, and the judge decided to give you 40, he didn't have to give you notice of why he was giving you the highest sentence. And now that we've returned to a system that is closer to that, why should we interpret 32(h) as imposing a very difficult to comply with requirement that didn't exist under the -- under the pre-pre-Booker system?",
  "What is she supposed to do? Usually there -- there's just one sentencing hearing, right?",
  "And there's - -",
  "-- a pre-sentence report which both parties have. And sometimes there are witnesses who come in. Sometimes the injured parties or the relatives of the deceased party come in; and -- and usually the sentence is imposed at the end of that proceeding. Now when is -- when is the judge supposed to be so precise as to what particular matters induce her to -- to raise this sentence here?",
  "Are you going to have a recess? Or maybe reschedule the sentencing for -- for a week later so that the judge can decide in detail what particular factors motivate her?",
  "Now if it is in the pre-sentence report, is that enough notice?",
  "So long as it is in the pre-sentence notice the judge doesn't have to say I plan to rely on this aspect of the pre-sentence report?",
  "Okay.",
  "It's not what it meant when 32(h) was promulgated.",
  "You could apply departure to post-Booker; but at the time this rule was adopted, departure did not consist of that; it consisted of something much more narrow.",
  "It's almost, you know, a determination of the judge's gut feeling of what is condign punishment for a particular - -",
  "In a lot of cases, though, it will be impossible for judges to make their determination the night before, take home the pre-sentence report, and, you know, stuff from the trial and focus on the next morning's sentencing hearing.",
  "-- decide it a week in advance. Do judges do that, decide a week in advance? I doubt it.",
  "I could have sworn that I've seen more than one petition for certiorari in which the claim is that the sentence was increased on remand vindictively. I'm sure I've seen cert petitions like that. And you're telling me that the assertion of vindictiveness is unnecessary, and it just can't be increased on remand? But all you have is a court of appeals case for that.",
  "Who asked this question? We're going to get a totally different case here.",
  "I thought it was sort of an important part of your case that the cross-appeal rule was an established rule. You now knowledge that it's not an established rule?",
  "Not just jurisdictional but well-established.",
  "But you say it is a well-established at least rule of practice.",
  "And what's to be said against that? How many courts of appeals do not apply that?",
  "Well, they - -",
  "They didn't apply it under this statute. I am saying, apart from this statute, what courts of appeals in other cases deny the existence of a cross-appeal rule?",
  "Ms. Maynard - -",
  "It seems to me many of these horribles really exist, however we decide this case. I don't know that anybody says that if there is not a firm rule requiring the -- a cross-appeal, I don't know that anybody says that the court of appeals must search the record and correct any errors below.",
  "The statute talks about the general - -",
  "The general cross-appeal rule - -",
  "It happens all the time, that there's an error in the judgment which the court of appeals does not -- does not reach because there's no court -- no cross-appeal. It's totally unexceptionable.",
  "Me, too.",
  "Could we discuss -- let's leave aside for the moment what the background rule of law is and discuss whether -- I guess it was your first point -- whether this particular statute proscribes the answer, and therefore, we don't have to go any further. Why do you say it proscribes the answer?",
  "Well, why would -- why would Congress want a different disposition for (f)(1) than for (f)(2)? It's clear under (f)(2) if the sentence is outside the applicable guidelines and the - - or if the departure is based on an impermissible factor or is to an unreasonable degree or the sentence was imposed for an offense for which there is no applicable guideline and its plainly unreasonable, for that, it is clear that if it hasn't been raised by one or the other party, the court doesn't get into it. Why would it want a different rule for those two? In other words, I'm saying that far from supporting your case, as your brief suggests, (f)(2) (a) and (a) seems to me harms your case.",
  "Not if it's too high and the defendant has appealed.",
  "Not if it's too high and the government has appealed.",
  "If it's too high and the government has appealed, you don't get any relief under -- under - -",
  "Of course, that difference disappears if you say that, in fact, the whole thing assumes that the factor complained of has been brought to the court's attention by the proper person. So that (f)(1) assumes that if it's the government appealing in violation of law because the defendant was given too little, or if it's the defendant appealing because in violation of law that he was given too much, it makes much more sense that way, it seems to me.",
  "But it's not enough to say, well, we've noticed by the way we're -- you know, in looking at the proper appeal by the proper -- my goodness, look what we've noticed. It's not that. You're saying the court of appeals has to search the record. It has to make sure that there were no errors in favor -- or harming the other party who has not cross-appealed. And that's a considerable burden, as Judge Boudin's opinion on the court of appeals makes clear.",
  "And it's extraordinary.",
  "Precisely so.",
  "Which is why we have tried to pare down what is jurisdictional.",
  "This argument is not an argument under the statute? This is an argument giving your interpretation of what the background rule is?",
  "And you would limit the background rule to plain error?",
  "So that it was a violation of law?",
  "What do we mean by the \"sentencing packaging rule\"?",
  "Getting what he deserves, right?",
  "(E) also contradicts (f) - -",
  "-- (2)(A) and (B) because in some of those cases it doesn't determine that if the appeal has been brought by the wrong party.",
  "Our jurisprudence just requires the narrowing of the death penalty to be -- to particularly heinous crimes. And one could say that rape is in and of itself particularly heinous, rape of a child of 12 or under.",
  "How would you describe a particularly heinous rape of a child under 12? What would make it particularly heinous?",
  "Suppose -- suppose the State says that all recidivist rapists of children under 12 will suffer the death penalty. Does it have to narrow that class further? I mean, the need for narrowing depends upon how narrow the class is described in the first place. Right?",
  "I mean, if the law says you have to be a recidivist, you have to have all the other factors that you just mentioned, if the law said that, would you come in and say, \"Oh, no, you can't just give everybody who commits that crime the death penalty\"? You have to narrow the class.",
  "That's a - -",
  "That's strange way of making a majority, isn't it?",
  "Two people who think even the death penalty for murder is no good, they're going to form the majority of people who consider whether a lawful death penalty can be imposed for rape. I think at least in those circumstances, you have to discount the people who would not allow the death penalty under any circumstances for any crime.",
  "He - -",
  "He -- he is not considering the issue that is before the Court. The issue before the Court is whether -- whether a permissible death penalty can be imposed for this crime. These parties say there's no such thing as a permissible death penalty. I mean, it would be -- if that wrinkle isn't there, we should iron it in pretty quickly.",
  "That's nice.",
  "I say that's nice. We're in effect -- in effect prohibiting the people from changing their mind.",
  "-- about what justify's the death penalty.",
  "Didn't we say in Atkins that it's the trend that counts; it's not the number?",
  "The trend -- the trendy expression hoist by your own petard: The trend here is clearly in the direction of permitting more and more - - of more and more States permitting the capital punishment for this crime.",
  "They don't even have to say \"the extent allowed by the United States Supreme Court.\" They can pass a law that seems to contradict a prior opinion of ours; can't they?",
  "Abraham Lincoln should they could, anyway.",
  "Do you really think that if this Court held in the present case that the death penalty can be imposed for the rape of a child under 12, do you really think that the trend would not continue, that there would not be more States to enact such a penalty?",
  "That there would be more?",
  "That it would not.",
  "Isn't there a Federal treason statute?",
  "And that doesn't require murder; does it?",
  "Do you think that's unconstitutional?",
  "Do you think treason is worse than child rape?",
  "Well - -",
  "How do you do view recidivism? I mean, I assume even if you don't oppose the death penalty, you're going to get a good number of years, right? So you are going to be 40 years in prison, come out and do it again? I don't think so.",
  "I mean, it is an unrealistic condition that you have raped a 12-year -- a child twice. The first time you do it and are convicted of it, you'll be sent up for long enough that you won't have the chance to do it a second time.",
  "Just the way they used to.",
  "Ms. Clark, what do you do with the requirement that our cases have imposed? It is not a requirement I agree with, but it is certainly one our cases have imposed, that you cannot leave -- leave it to the jury whether to impose the death penalty or not even for murder, but rather you have to narrow the class of people who have committed that particular crime so that -- so that the imposition won't be random. Although later, we say you have to let the jury consider any mitigating factory which makes it random; but nonetheless, our cases do say you have to narrow the class of murderers who can be given the death penalty. Wouldn't the same apply to the class of child rapists?",
  "Why not.",
  "You think intentional murder of a -- of a law officer would need no further narrowing?",
  "Do you? Do you really?",
  "Didn't the -- didn't the Louisiana statute that -- that was at issue in Lowenfield produce the result that if you committed intentional murder of a law enforcement officer, it was up to the jury whether to give you the death penalty or not?",
  "Would not the same result be -- be achieved by a statute that said if you intentionally kill a law enforcement officer, you are subject to the death penalty? Wouldn't it be precisely the same degree of narrowing?",
  "It was not all child rape.",
  "It was not all child rape. It was only children up to the age of 11.",
  "I don't understand the difference. If you have a general murder law with an aggravating factor of killing of a law officer, okay, the jury can decide from the whole category of killings of law officers who gets the death penalty and who doesn't. Why is that any different from what happens when you have a statute that makes it a capital offense to kill a law officer, without any further qualification? It's exactly the same result. It goes to the jury. This person killed a law officer. It is up to you whether you give him the death penalty or not.",
  "You don't need a reason to file a FOIA request anyway, right? Just the naked curiosity justifies your obtaining the documents, right? I mean this is a lawsuit that does not require a reason except I want the documents. You've got them. I'm entitled to them.",
  "I mean somebody could have walked in off the street and filed this same lawsuit, right?",
  "Although it is not really just your argument; it is also FOIA; isn't it?",
  "What are your clear rules? Give me -- set it forth clearly, what you think it takes. Number one, do -- do you have to know you're going to be bound at the time the first suit is brought? That isn't the requirement, is it?",
  "Right.",
  "So what are your tests? How many? Five? Four? It is not a totality of the circumstances, test though, right?",
  "You have some criteria. What are they?",
  "Agency?",
  "Okay.",
  "Okay.",
  "A representative that they agreed to?",
  "As in a class action, where they have the -- the ability to bow out if they want, right?",
  "Yes. I mean, and the individual's ability to withdraw from the class, if he doesn't want to be bound by this suit, right?",
  "That is crucial.",
  "We can use it accurately, bring it back to what it really means - -",
  "Can we?",
  "Even if company is represented by the same law firm?",
  "I think you'd also say that if the company paid for the suit. The company just - - \"I don't want to be in control of it. I don't want you to sue in my name, but I think this is a good thing for you to do, so I'll pay for it.\"",
  "No. No. The company says, \"absolutely I do not want you to represent me.\" That is in -- in a letter. Okay? So it's clear that the law firm is not representing the company, but the company thinks that it's a good idea to have this lawsuit and yeah, I'll bankroll it.",
  "I think you've got to give that one away.",
  "If he -- if he was his agent -- and this goes to Justice Ginsburg's line of inquiry -- suppose in the second case Herrick tells him I want you to bring a suit on my behalf. He says fine, I'll do that. He brings that suit. And then Taylor says, you know, I also want to bring a suit on my own. And he brings another suit, not as agent for Herrick. I suppose he could do that, couldn't he? The first would be thrown out because it's Herrick's second suit. But the -- Taylor's own suit would remain Taylor's own suit, wouldn't it?",
  "So long as there's no more collusion or anything else, he's - -",
  "I hope so.",
  "That's a -- it's a standard privity case. It is privity in reverse. I suppose a subsequent owner of real estate is in privity with, and therefore, bound by a judgment concerning the real estate rendered against the prior owner. But it's probably also true that when there's a suit by a later owner, the prior owner cannot then bring in court a claim based upon the same -- the same matters that the subsequent owner relied on.",
  "It's up privity instead of down privity. Wouldn't that - -",
  "Counsel, you have described for us a thousand-headed monster of litigation, and your proposal for a solution is to cut off one eyebrow. You're going to solve just the case of, you know, two people building an airplane. You agree, anybody else in the association can file a lawsuit. Anybody else in the United States can file a lawsuit, even if they're not in the association. It seems to me that, you know, in order to cut off an eyebrow, I'm not willing to make a whole lot of incursion upon our traditional rules of who's bound by a lawsuit.",
  "Why should we stretch for that?",
  "No.",
  "It is sort of a totality-of-the-circumstances test in every case, right.",
  "We look at the whole thing, and we say, you know, close enough relationship. It is not close enough; close enough. You need a better rule than that for something that, you know, is a threshold issue in a case.",
  "That's just as bad. You're absolutely right. That's just as bad.",
  "What -- what the opinion said is to review the bidding. There is record evidence that: One, Taylor and Herrick had identical interests; two, Taylor's interest was adequately represented in Herrick; three, Herrick and Taylor had a close working relationship relative to these successive cases. And that's enough. That's enough to show collusion.",
  "Rational-basis review normally doesn't inquire into the actual motive, for example, of the State legislators who impose such a tax or impose such a restriction. We simply ask: Could there have been a rational basis for this? Now, are you willing to abide by that test?",
  "Listen to what I'm saying. Not whether you could decide that, given all of the facts of this case, the criticism of the co- workers and all of that, whether it is conceivable to say that this was done on a rational basis. That isn't the rational-basis test. It's just sitting back without these factual inquiries, just as we don't inquire factually into why the State legislature acted, just asking: Could there have been a rational basis for the dismissal of this employee?",
  "No, no, no, no. I'm not working with this person; he is not going to affect my efficiency. He's under somebody below me but I just don't like him.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Suppose the government -- suppose the government comes in and says, we don't want to take a position as to -- as to what the reason was; it could have been any one of the following seven -- you know, the wheat market collapsed; she came in late five days; some of the jobs she did she didn't do well; she dressed inappropriately on the job; her co-workers didn't like they are -- you know. And -- can the government do that?",
  "How far -- does it have to pick a reason? You're -- you're --",
  "So long as there is conceivable reason, the court would grant summary judgment?",
  "That's what I thought, too.",
  "All those facts are true facts, but the government isn't claiming that any one of them was the reason. It just says here are the conceivable reasons why -- why she might have been fired. We really don't know which one it was.",
  "But here are seven perfectly conceivable reasons.",
  "What do you mean, to negate it? To negate it as the actual reason is what you mean.",
  "But the government is not purporting that -- to say that it's the actual reason.",
  "The government is saying had she been dismissed for this reason, and we really don't know whether that was the reason or not, but had she been dismissed for this reason it would have been rational.",

  "But as far as the Federal law claim is concerned, you'd urge us to come out the same way, even if this case came up before the Administrative Procedure Act was passed, right?",
  "But as to Federal employment, you'd say the same?",
  "And you'd say the same as if there were no State remedies for --",
  "-- employment discrimination by the State.",
  "Because the State has a right to employ at will?",
  "Why can't you simply say that they are not being denied equal protection of the law? The law that applies to her and to everybody else employed by the government is that the employment is at will?",
  "That's certainly an equal protection. She could be fired at will and everybody else can be fired at will.",
  "Why isn't that equal protection of the law?",
  "It doesn't talk about equal protection, actually, it talks about equal protection the law; and if -- if the law in the government employment context is that you can be dismissed at will, or for a number of reasons, so long as everybody is subject to that same law, it would seem to be no discrimination in the law?",
  "Oh, don't rely on the text, certainly.",
  "Mr. Herman, can the government respond to political speech? The government can have a position on smoking cigarettes, it can have a position on a lot of things, but can it have a position on whether the Republican Party or the Democratic Party should win the next election?",
  "Isn't that a distinction here?",
  "Do we usually evaluate restrictions on First Amendment rights on the basis of whether the chill that was imposed by the government was actually effective in stifling the right?",
  "If the person goes ahead and speaks anyway, is he estopped from saying that the government was chilling his speech nonetheless?",
  "Isn't that's what's going on here?",
  "The government says that in fact more and quite a bit more incumbents went over the $350,000 personal funding limits than non-incumbents. Something like -- I don't know, 14-2 or something like that in the last election, is that right?",
  "Yes.",
  "Of course, that could mean that the millionaires have already been elected and are now pulling up the ladder after them.",
  "Right.",
  "But that wouldn't level the playing field. I mean, the other side, the millionaire, won't take the public funding and he'll spend his millions and whoever gets the public funding -- or are you saying the public funding should match whatever the other side pays?",
  "Well then --",
  "Do you think that's a valid constitutional objective, to level the playing field?",
  "Do you think we should trust our incumbent senators and representatives to level the playing field for us?",
  "What we're talking about in leveling the playing field, I guess, is leveling the amount of speech that each side has, to make sure that each side has the same amount of speech. Is that -- is that what's going on here?",
  "Are we -- are we talking wealthy people here? What's the average price of a home in the United States? I think it's a good deal above $350,000, isn't it?",
  "It doesn't limit those restrictions on your candidate.",
  "It simply makes the imposition of the restrictions uneven.",
  "Doesn't it prohibit -- I thought it prohibited him from raising funds in the amount from as wealthy donors as his opponent can now go to? Don't those limits on contributions continue to apply to him?",
  "Who is more incorruptible than the millionaire, right?",
  "The ultimate incorruptible.",
  "It has penalized his own spending.",
  "That just means he is willing to accept the penalty in the next election even if this case doesn't come out in his favor.",
  "It doesn't prove that it isn't a penalty.",
  "You think that's really a proper function of government, to look out over there and say, we're going to even the playing field in this election? What if some -- one candidate is more eloquent than the other one? You make him talk with pebbles in his mouth or what?",
  "But the campaign finance regimes we've approved up to now, the significant limitations, have had an anti-corruption rationale. There is no anti-corruption rationale here. The only purpose of this is to level the playing field. And I am deeply suspicious of allowing elections to be conducted under a regime whereby Congress levels the playing field. That seems to be very dangerous.",
  "I thought that that's what a facial challenge essentially consists of. You don't look to see whether in fact the harmful First Amendment effect has occurred; you look to whether it opens up the possibility for that to occur.",
  "You can't go in before the election and say: Look, I'm about to be terribly disadvantaged; my opponent is about to have all of these coordinated expenses and I'm not able to. And you're going to say: Oh, we have to wait until the election is over to see whether in fact that happens. It seems to me this is precisely the kind of a situation a facial challenge is designed for.",
  "What if one party has more time on his hands? He's -- he's unemployed, so he -- you know, he can go around, whereas the other party has to -- has to hire people to speak for him. He has -- he has a job most of the time. Are you going to even that disparity, too?",
  "I can understand leveling, leveling contribution limits when you're worried about corruption, I can understand that. But doing it just to -- to make sure that there is an even playing field, I -- there's just no end to that. And it just isn't money that makes it an even playing feed. A lot of other factors -- incumbency, the war chest that incumbents have which -- money from the last election, that isn't counted for -- for the millionaires' provision. There are so many factors that -- that go to making the even playing field that I -- I'm just very reluctant to acknowledge a congressional power to -- to sit in judgment of our elections that way.",

  "That's the price of accepting the government subsidy. They're -- nobody is accepting a government subsidy here. The man is spending his own money --",
  "-- for a speech.",
  "On the theory that it doesn't make much sense anyway? Is that why --",
  "-- we can chop it up this way?",
  "Suppose we found -- we were of the view that all of the provisions, that the benefits given to the other side here are bad. I suppose we could even -- re-even the playing field by either denying those benefits to the candidate opposing the Appellant, the Petitioner here, or we could do the opposite and eliminate similar restrictions upon -- upon the Petitioner. Do you have any idea which way we ought to go?",
  "Well, it advises the other side that they should get ready to raise more money.",
  "Well -- I mean if you say all of the rest of the statute is okay, that's certainly reasonable. If you're going to let the guy go above the limits that would otherwise apply, it's useful to let him know in advance so he can start, you know, beating the bushes, right?",
  "I would think that the difference is that his statements about her were subject to cross-examination.",
  "And her statements about him were not.",

  "He is thinking about Cambridge and not England.",
  "Do any of them have anything to do with the Confrontation Clause?",
  "And besides which, the question that Justice Breyer was asking was already answered in Crawford; wasn't it?",
  "A case from which he dissented. But we did say that the meaning of the Confrontation Clause is the meaning it bore when the people adopted it.",
  "Instead of intent, the dying declaration rule required knowledge by the declarant that the declarant was about to die.",
  "Right?",
  "And the evidence of truthfulness was apparently that the person was about to enter the next world.",
  "And most of us don't lie at that particular moment. Whereas, in the Confrontation Clause situation you have a totally different situation.",
  "You jumped off in Crawford, I thought.",
  "I had thought that the common law rule is that you have to have rendered the -- intentionally rendered the witness unavailable with regard to the particular trial that's before the court. Not rendering the witness unavailable for some other litigation.",
  "Do you know of any case where it was some other litigation that --",
  "I didn't think so.",
  "Well, it didn't put it in those very words, but I think a lot of -- of the quotations from opinions cited by your friend seemed to me to say that. But why don't you start off by telling -- by explaining to us why these many cases excluded the dying declaration of the murdered person when -- if it could not be shown that the murdered person knew when the declaration was made that he or she was dying? If the rule that you're announcing was the rule at common law, all of those would have come in because that declaration said this Defendant killed me. And, therefore, it would have been true in all of those cases that this defendant procured the absence of the witness from the trial. How do you explain that. And there are many cases. It's not just a few. The requirement in the dying declaration cases that the -- that the declarant be aware of impending death is uniform. Why even bother with that requirement if it could all come in under -- under this procurement of the absence-of-the-witness rule?",
  "I'm not sure you've answered my question. Why wasn't it enough for the prosecution to say: This dying person said that this defendant killed her; therefore, this declaration can come in because this defendant procured the absence of this declarant by killing her?",
  "Nobody even ever makes those arguments. They fight it out on whether the declarant was aware of impending death or not, but that would have been totally irrelevant if it all comes in under -- under the rule that you're arguing for here.",
  "Doesn't it have to be interpreted that way? You don't contend it could be interpreted differently?",
  "Just because it says so, I mean.",
  "Can you give us one case from the common law, just one, in which the procurement of a witness's absence exception to the Confrontation Clause was applied where there was no intent to prevent the witness from testifying?",
  "I don't think you do either.",
  "You wouldn't want us to get caught up in the limitations of the Confrontation Clause?",
  "If that's a fault, it's a fault that also exists with the rule being argued by your opponent, isn't it?",
  "Maybe I have to take that back. Maybe it -- it's very -- it would be very unusual that someone would kill a victim in order to prevent her testifying at a murder trial which is not yet in prospect because you haven't murdered her. So these cases may be very rare. So maybe that is an advantage of her rule over yours, that you would very rarely have to find the defendant guilty of the very crime for which he's being prosecuted in order to apply the -- the exception to the Confrontation Clause.",
  "Okay.",
  "It would be rare on her theory; it wouldn't be rare on yours. It happens all the time on yours, I would think.",
  "I suppose you could appeal to the maxim noscitur ex sociis, couldn't you --",
  "-- and say if it's in with two other chickens, it's probably a chicken?",
  "What do you mean by - - let's get straight by what we mean by \"in actuality conflicted.\" Isn't the fiduciary who has a financial interest in actuality conflicted?",
  "And aren't we talking in this case always about fiduciaries who are in actuality conflicted.",
  "No. That's, that's a conflicted fiduciary who allows the conflict to warp its judgment. But the conflict exists whether you, whether you give it effect or not.",
  "So let's call that a conflicted fiduciary, somebody who has two loyalties, whether or not he allows the one loyalty to distort his judgment.",
  "But you're saying it doesn't make any difference. You say you should take it into account, but if it was a reasoned decision, which is the test whether or not he's a fiduciary, if it's a reasoned decision the fact that he's a fiduciary makes no difference, right? Isn't that what you're saying?",
  "It does make a decision then. What was a reasoned decision for someone who doesn't have a conflict becomes an unreasoned decision simply by reason of the fact that he has a conflict?",
  "Ms. Posner, it seems to me that that ought to be looked at with suspicion, whether or not the person making the decision has a conflict. I mean that smells bad or doesn't smell bad, as you say, either way.",
  "And I am still -- listen, I know that we're responsible for this because we said it in Firestone. We said that a conflict of interest should be weighed as a factor. If that means anything, it seems to me it means that sometimes that weight will make the difference. So at least sometimes -- but you're not willing to admit that -- at least sometimes you would say, oh, yes, this is a reasonable decision and had this decision been made by a fiduciary without a conflict, it would be perfectly okay because it's reasonable. That's the test. However, since this fiduciary has a conflict, what was a reasonable decision, whoof, the added weight, it becomes an unreasonable decision.",
  "Is that what you mean by giving it some weight?",
  "You do.",
  "So a perfectly reasonable decision becomes unreasonable simply because you have a conflict?",
  "Dictum.",
  "What I don't like about the dictum is I don't know what it means.",
  "I think it's lovely to say weigh it as a factor, it gets the case off our docket and it's fine. But what does it mean?",
  "Does it mean that a perfectly reasonable decision that is within the discretion -- I mean this plan says that MetLife will have -- knowing that it will have the conflict, that they will make the decisions and so long as they are not arbitrary, they are valid. Now, let's take a perfectly reasonable decision. It is not arbitrary. Does giving weight to the existence of the conflict which the settlor of the plan expected to exist, does giving weight to that mean that what was reasonable becomes unreasonable?",
  "If it doesn't mean that, then it means nothing.",
  "Trust law doesn't say. Trust law does not establish a different standard of judicial review for the conflicted trustee.",
  "And - -",
  "But you say that one of the things that can make it unreasonable is the mere fact that there exists this -- this conflict.",
  "That renders what is a perfectly reasonable decision unreasonable. I - -",
  "I don't understand that. In very -- what kind of a standard is that, \"in very close cases\"? How is -- how are you going to review a court? I mean, give it some weight in very close cases? It slops over. This is not a standard. I don't know - - I don't know what you're telling the courts to do.",
  "Well, I don't mind reasonableness and I don't mind abuse of discretion. But you're telling me that even when the reasonableness standard is met, if there is this conflict, if it's close -- how close is close? You -- suddenly it flops over the edge. I mean, you know, close to the out - - it's -- it's beautiful art, but I don't understand how it turns into law.",
  "I don't think you're at all saying that it's the same standard of review. You keep saying that, and your friend said it, but it's not the same standard of review. You say it's still the reasonableness standard of review, but then you say, however, the mere fact of the existence of the conflict does at the edges make unreasonable what used to be reasonable. That is a different standard of review. It means you are not using a single reasonableness standard of review. You're arguing for a second standard of review that is so vague I don't know what it means. Why not just say that the district court, when there is a conflict of this sort, has to spend two more hours considering the case?",
  "There's a clear rule, you know.",
  "Well, if you're going to do that, you have to tell me how much it weighs. You see, if you use it in step two when things are in equipoise, it doesn't matter how much it weighs. It's enough if it weighs a feather. In the equipoise case you come out the other way. But if you're going to use it in the first structural system to determine, you know, how much each side -- I have to know its weight. And there is no indication whatever as to what its weight is. It's really up to the district judge, I guess, to decide how much weight he is going to give to the fact that there is this conflict.",
  "I'm not weighing reasonableness. I'm weighing that factor of the conflict. That's what you ask us to weigh.",
  "It's not reasonableness.",
  "Then you should only use it as a tiebreaker, I suggest, if you can tell me.",
  "What did you just say? I don't understand that. The conflict was intended by the employer. He appointed the - -",
  "Was intended by the - -",
  "Your implied -- your implied preemption argument would certainly fall prey to that -- to that point.",
  "Good idea.",

  "Excuse me before you go. I don't understand that. It is not specially targeted at cigarettes and at the harmful health effects of cigarettes?",
  "It's a general statute but in Riegel we -- we took a general statute and looked at what its specific application in the case was.",

I plan to go back and read it. Assuming I agree with him rather than you, has the government's position changed from what it was then? As far as you know, is the government's position still the same, the position that you delicately did not bring to our attention?",
  "Yes. In Reilly. I haven't read the brief there, I must say. But suppose I agree with Petitioner. Can I assume - -",
  "And do you assume that it's --",
  "No, I'm not asking about -- I'll figure that out on my own. Trust me. I can probably figure that out. But once I have figured it out, can I assume that that is still the government's position - -",

  "But, of course, they wouldn't be subsidizing it if -- if, indeed, it is some kind of a -- essentially an insurance scheme. They - - they contribute to the national union, and in exchange the national union defends their interest just as it defends the interest of other unions.

  "It doesn't seem to me fair to call it \"subsidizing\" if, in fact, that's what's going on.",
  "I don't know because that wasn't inquired into by the court below. I guess we really -- we really don't know, do we, when -- whether the local union can make any demands upon the -- upon the national union for -- for litigation defense?",
  "Yes, but it's based on the experience of the whole -- the whole cohort of insureds.",
  "And the Chief Justice's question says: Can a -- can a -- a local that is certainly on the basis of past experience not going to need this insurance nearly as much as other locals - - can it enter into an insurance arrangement with other locals to buy the insurance for all of the locals even though it knows that it won't benefit very much from that insurance policy?",
  "That was -- he was trying to help you.",
  "You should have said, yes, Chief Justice.",
  "Well, it isn't banned. It's just -- just -- you know, you don't force the nonunion member who indeed may be anti-union to pay for it. And he doesn't want to subsidize the union librarian. He doesn't like unions here. He doesn't like unions in Hawaii. And for the government to force him to -- to support the union is, I thought, part of the reasoning behind - -",
  "The issue is not whether that's a fair thing for the national union to do. The issue is whether the person who is being compelled against his will to pay dues to the union is getting anything back for that compelled payment. And even though the national union may be acting in an entirely fair fashion, given its national objectives, the -- the compelled payment is not doing what our cases seem to say it must do. It has to be paying for services rendered.",
  "Well, it doesn't have to do that. It can use the money of its union members any way it wants. It can contribute to the national all of their money if it wishes. We are only talking about that portion of the union income which comes from people who don't want to join the union.",

Obviously this -- this section was meant to apply to equitable actions. You wouldn't dismiss them in law for a -- a ground that only existed in equity?",
  "I don't know. When it says they are enforceable and makes an exception only for grounds that enable revocation in law or in equity, I would -- I would think that the general command was meant to apply to both law and equity.",
  "Say that again. I didn't follow that.",
  "Why -- why wouldn't 1332 require complete diversity and require the court to assure itself of that anyway?",
  "I thought you said it did have a look through, an automatic look through, itself.",
  "I see. I see. You are - - you are -- you are limiting it to the amount.",
  "What is the dispute? You say the dispute is not defined by what -- what has been brought in a complaint.",
  "But you -- from your argument, I would gather that a court would be able to imagine a counterclaim. Once it finds out, you know, what -- what -- what the principal complaint is about, the court could imagine that there would be a counterclaim for interest or for something else.",
  "It's very strange to decide Federal jurisdiction on the basis of -- of imagined - - imagined complaints.",
  "So the problem with his -- I mean with his interpretation, you don't have to imagine anything.",
  "Well - -",
  "You don't have to imagine complaints. You -- you don't have to invent litigation.",
  "It's close to inconceivable to me that Congress wanted us to -- to construct litigation that is not yet in existence.",
  "No, but your position is it doesn't have to exist. Had that litigation not been brought, had the motion to arbitrate been brought before a lawsuit was filed, that the court would still have to consider what is the dispute between the parties and what kind of complaints could that dispute have generated.",
  "That's what worries me. That's what worries me.",
  "If we accept your theory, this is the easiest case, what about the hard cases that are further down the line?",
  "Well, it makes a nullity of it, except that it gets into the Federal court the decision on the arbitration agreement, which was the object of this stuff, whatever -- whatever the underlying claim is, whether it's a Federal claim or not. As I understood the purpose of the Arbitration Act, it was to make sure that arbitration was -- was honored not just in Federal cases but in State cases as well. And it's entirely compatible with that, that sometimes a Federal court will -- will direct arbitration in a case this involves an underlying controversy that's purely non-Federal.",
  "Why -- why can't you have sort of modified look, through like a modified limited hangout or whatever it was? That is to say, you can look through for the purpose of determining whether the arbitration agreement raises a Federal question. But that doesn't mean you have to look through to determine whether the underlying controversy raises a Federal question.",
  "I thought negligence is irrelevant here. I think if the police department was wrong, even if they had been very careful but for some reason or other they made a mistake -- so you're arguing for shear causality, not for negligence. If negligence made the difference then we'd have to go into these factors that you say are very difficult to calculate.",
  "I know you were answering his question, but you want to answer it in a way that's consistent with your argument here.",
  "You've injected the word \"negligence.\"",
  "Alone, but - -",
  "-- there is dual causality.",
  "It isn't a matter of simple negligence.",
  "Just so I have your theory firmly in mind, you would say there is police error even if what happened was that there was an unpredictable and unavoidable computer glitch, no negligence on anybody's part? The computer simply malfunctioned, got it wrong. It wasn't negligence. You would still say that that is police error, and you would say that that counts against the admission of - -",
  "Exactly. You give something, you get something. If you adopt a negligence theory, the - -",
  "-- the noose is not as wide, but on the other hand it's a lot harder to calculate whether you -- every case involves an inquiry into whether there's police negligence or not.",
  "A much easier rule, was there a warrant or not? If there wasn't, end of the - - end of the inquiry.",
  "Isn't there probable cause here?",
  "He thought he had a warrant; he had probable cause to arrest.",
  "It doesn't seem to make sense, though. Why should we separate the two?",
  "If the policeman is mistaken about whether he saw this guy picking somebody's pocket, he's mistaken about that, and in that case, the search is -- the product of the search is admitted. In the other case he's mistaken about whether there was a warrant. Why do you want to draw a line between those two?",
  "That's crucial to your case --",
  "-- really, that you -- that the police will not keep good records unless -- unless we let the criminals go.",
  "And that's the theory of the exclusionary rule as - -",
  "-- as has been expressed in writings in some of our prior cases. Things have changed a whole lot since we adopted the exclusionary rule, and I think it's quite -- policing has become much more professional, and I think it's quite unrealistic to think that if we don't adopt the rule that you -- that you propose, police -- police departments will just willy-nilly not keep track of warrants. I -- I just don't think that's true. That's not professional policing, and -- and I think to say -- to apply the - - the severe remedy that you propose in this -- in this area at this date seems to me excessive.",
  "You don't think that - -",
  "They -- they won't know that they are going to lose a case. What they will know is that if they happen to arrest someone whom they should not have arrested anyway, they won't be able to prosecute him, right?",
  "So they are saving themselves nothing. I mean, this person would not have been stopped. I mean, if the difference was we -- we caught a criminal and we could have convicted him except because of the clerical error we can't, but that's not the situation. They would never have found this fellow but for the clerical error.",
  "You would allow all of that inquiry every time there's a motion to exclude. That would not just be the basis for 1983. You still want negligence inquiry.",
  "Thank you. That's a little different.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, if we adopt your formulation that isolated negligence doesn't count, is it clear that that's all there was in this case?",
  "I agree with that. If - - to say with Mr. Dreeben that we don't have to decide that today is just unrealistic. We have to decide today whether we are going to adopt a rule that down the road will turn every exclusionary request into a pretrial investigation of the procedures of the police.",
  "And a major -- major trial.",
  "That's your bottom line position, it has to be a negligent error?",
  "What is the position you're arguing for?",
  "You want to adopt a rule that's only when it's a negligent error?",
  "May I ask one question, Chief.",
  "Your -- your comment seems to assume that these warrants just lie there and the police only use them incidentally. I have always assumed that when a warrant is out, part of the job of the police is to -- is to arrest the person. Isn't that the case?",
  "That's not a long time. What -- what was the situation when the Fourth Amendment was adopted? Do you know? If you stopped Thomas Jefferson's carriage to arrest Thomas Jefferson and you pulled him off to the side of the road, could you - - could you then go and search his carriage? I'm struck by the fact that there is no effort in your brief whatever to take this thing back any more than 27 years. Now, you know, it could -- it could well be that it has always been considered reasonable to search the person and to search the conveyance from which the person has been taken. If that's the case, I could say, gee, it's always been considered reasonable, end of case. But - - but you -- you give me nothing to hang my hat on.",
  "That's a reasonable rule. What isn't a reasonable rule is to say at the same premises as long as the officer is there and the officer is at risk. I mean that is just -- it's just silly. It's -- it's simply not the case. And -- and if you bring that forward as the justification for this rule, I'm going to say, you know, get rid of it.",
  "Realistically, he is not at risk. The guy is handcuffed in the police cruiser, and so I want to go and search his car. What -- what risk to the officer is being avoided?",
  "I wouldn't. I'll bet you that in most of those cases the -- the felon got out the other -- other door of the car while the policeman was searching the vehicle.",
  "Once you -- once you eliminate the -- the need to show that the officer's safety was threatened why -- why would you limit the search just to the passenger compartment of the vehicle? Why don't you let him search the trunk, too?",
  "I know -- I know you're not but it just doesn't make sense to me to -- to abandon the requirement that the -- that the officer's safety be threatened and yet to say oh, but he can only search the -- the passenger compartment. If indeed there is reduced expectation of privacy for the automobile, you arrest somebody you can search the automobile; what's wrong with that?",
  "You've arrested this guy for -- for reckless driving. He was going 25 miles over the speed limit, okay? And you're going to search his car for evidence? Of what?",
  "You're going to allow the search nonetheless. Let's assume he is handcuffed in the back, so officer safety is not at issue; but you say we want to be able to search a car for evidence. Evidence of what?",
  "I understand that.",
  "You have to link -- if you're going to use that rationale you have to link the reason for the arrest with the likelihood that there would be any evidence found in the car that would support the arrest.",
  "Oh, so -- so you, you avowedly say that once you arrest somebody you can rummage around for evidence of a different crime, right?",
  "Why -- why can they impound it? Suppose they stop and he pulls over to the side of the street where there is parking, all-night parking. What authority would they have to drag that car away?",
  "He says, \"Let me lock my car.\" You know, \"I park it on the street all the time. It's a lousy car any way. Nobody wants to steal it.\"",
  "I can see some situations where -- where, for public safety or other reasons, you have to remove the car from where it is, and I guess the best thing to do is to drag it off to the police impoundment yard. But in other situations, I -- you speak so blithely of impoundment as though -- as though that's an automatic remedy. I just don't know that it is.",
  "So -- a fine-line rule. I mean -- and you can instruct all the police officers in your department, when you arrest somebody, have them stand right near the car while you search it. Okay? Make sure that he's near enough that, you know, he's a threat to your safety.",
  "That's certainly a bright-line rule.",
  "Why -- why is that so for searches of the vehicle? When it isn't -- it isn't so for search of the person? I mean, if the police arrest Mother Teresa, they are still entitled to frisk her, right, even though there's little likelihood that she has a Gatt?",
  "What -- if -- if we don't apply the officer safety rationale to searches of the person, no matter how elderly, how eminent, how virtuous the person is, you can frisk. We're obviously not applying the officer safety rule across the board. We're adopting a bright-line rule that obviously applies to many situations in which the officer is not at risk. Why can't you do the same for automobiles?",
  "What's -- what's the history there? Do you know the history there.",
  "Yes, Thomas Jefferson's conveyance - -",
  "There is not much there.",
  "There is not much there.",
  "We know what's going to happen on remand, though, don't we? Doesn't the Fifth Circuit already have case law on -- on that question?",
  "Sorry. Does this appear somewhere in the materials? It's always helpful.",
  "That's not your point. It would seem to me your point is that the QDRO is an exception to the assignment or alienation.",
  "And your point is this has been no assignment or agency, so we don't need the QDRO exception. There is nothing in here that violates anything in the statute.",
  "So whether he could have done a QDRO is in your view irrelevant. Your basic case is the QDRO is an exception from the prohibition on assignment or alienation, that provision has no application here, there has been no assignment or alienation, and therefore the waiver is effective.",
  "Well, we -- I mean, we could have -- you know, we should have thought of that when we limited our -- our grant of certiorari to the - - to the one question on which you agree with the Petitioner. But we did do that, didn't we, even though the other one was -- was explicitly put under our nose, and we said we -- we are not going to get into that? We just want to decide this question, which is an important question all by itself.",
  "Do you know any other case in which we have explicitly declined to accept a question and then have used one of these other back doorways of -- of answering it anyway?",
  "I don't know of any. I mean maybe -- maybe we have but - -",
  "Did -- did we recognize in earlier cases that beneficiary designations are plan documents?",
  "Again, assuming there has been a change of beneficiary designation, and, of course, the argument you're confronted with is: I haven't changed anything. The prior beneficiary simply -- simply refused to accept it, waived it. I haven't changed the designation at all.",
  "Well, I think it's a harder question than you make it; and I, for one, have not gone into it as deeply as I would like to, principally because we rejected that -- that question.",
  "Do you know of any case in which we've done this - -",
  "-- rejected the question and then decided it?",
  "That's what I'm asking. Yes.",
  "You are sure of the answer. You don't know of any case.",
  "It would be the classic case but for the fact that we had rejected that question. Had we not been asked to decide it and said no, it would be the classic case, I agree.",
  "Can we expect that to happen in future cases when we turn down a question and amici and people come in and brief the question anyway and then ask us to decide it?",
  "Undoubtedly we should have granted it.",
  "Where would I find the latter? If I wanted to read it? Which I do.",
  "No, it also goes to the question of who is the person or persons who would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order.",
  "If there was a waiver and there had been no order, your friend's contention is by traditional common law, the person who would have been entitled to it would have been his client.",
  "I mean, I don't see how this language helps you. It sort of restates the question, but - -",
  "Right.",
  "If there had been no order - -",
  "Oh, I see. I see.",
  "I see your point. Does he agree with that, that apart from the divorce decree, there is no waiver?",
  "I got you.",
  "I see.",
  "You say the waiver is in the order?",
  "And without the order, there has been no waiver.",
  "We'll have to see whether your friend agrees with that. I'll bet he doesn't.",
  "What if they had agreed to the waiver apart from -- apart from the -- from the domestic relations order? Just apart from that, they have a separate signed waiver. We'd be in the same suit that you're -- that you say we have to avoid, wouldn't we?",
  "Well, if it's an alienation, but his point is that a waiver is not an alienation.",
  "What about some other waiver that's -- that's not in connection with a -- with a domestic relations thing? You know -- \"I've made my -- my eldest son a beneficiary.\" It turns out, you know, he is fat and happy; he doesn't need the money and he agrees to waive it, so -- so I can give it to an impecunious daughter. Okay? What -- what happens with that?",
  "Ah. Oh, oh, oh. You're jumping over to the other argument. Let's leave that argument out.",
  "Yes, but you would still - - the plan would still have to make some inquires, wouldn't it?",
  "Yes. Not getting in the plan documents.",
  "Sure.",
  "Well, that's -- that's the point that troubles me. It's -- it's the \"acquirer's\" language. Does -- does the person who -- who receives the -- the refused benefit acquire it from the other person? He certainly doesn't do so for Federal tax purposes.",
  "Does he acquire it from a participant or beneficiary?",
  "I thought the -- the notion is it's as though the -- it's as though the devise to the person refusing it had never occurred. I mean, there is -- there is no gift tax payable or anything else.",
  "Was this waiver only part of the divorce degree? Do you agree with your friend on that point?",
  "That's not separate and apart from the divorce decree.",
  "So a co-worker of your client says: You know, the boss really was guilty of sexual harassment and the co-worker says: Gee, that's terrible.",
  "That's enough? That's opposition?",
  "What about, violating the law is terrible?",
  "Okay. But if she said that in response to the remark by the co-worker that she had been subjected to sexual harassment and then the remark was \"Violating the law is terrible,\" that's opposition?",
  "But that doesn't solve the problem of having too broad an entry into this thing. You get to the jury by just showing that she said \"Oh, if he did that, it's terrible,\" and then it's up to the jury all of a sudden whether that is the reason that the employer fired this person or not. I mean, that just leaves -- lays the employer open to a lot of jury determinations that he shouldn't be subject to, it seems to me.",
  "And there does not have to have been sexual harassment in the employment unit.",
  "So this is a law directed against expressive activity.",
  "Are those laws good? I thought we had a First Amendment.",
  "It wouldn't be fine with me.",
  "What if -- what if I am indeed very much in favor of sexual harassment? I am a world class sexual harasser, but I'm also not a liar, and I'm -- I am subpoenaed or called up by the employer in connection with this internal investigation and asked whether so-and-so harassed a particular worker. And I'd say, yes, as a matter of fact, he did, and a good thing too. Is that expressing opposition?",
  "Covered by the participation clause?",
  "Well, since this is a case where the - -",
  "It would? Why? It doesn't seem so to me. I mean, it either was or wasn't. You're making the argument, essentially, that \"oppose\" has two quite different meanings. You can ask somebody, you know, do you oppose the war in Iraq? And all you're asking is what is your opinion of the war in Iraq. Do you think it is good or bad? But \"oppose\" is also used in a quite different sense. He -- you say somebody opposed the war in Iraq, you mean he went out and -- and paraded against it and so forth. And your assertion is that in this legislation, it has the latter meaning. It just doesn't ask for your opinion about whether sexual harassment is good or bad. It asks whether you were actively - - actively opposing it. Now, once you adopt that position, I don't see how the fact that you -- that something that was not active opposition can be converted into active opposition by something that occurred later. I mean, if you want to abandon your other argument, that's fine with me, but - -",
  "Would that uncomfortable? Say it doesn't. I mean, I -- I don't care if you're uncomfortable with it. Does it or doesn't it?",
  "Then I don't understand your case.",
  "It isn't just a specific - - again, if I don't understand your case, it isn't just a matter of the specific practice. Your point is it is not asking your opinion. It is asking whether you are actively trying to eliminate it. I think even if -- if you were asked your opinion, you know, do you -- do you oppose what, you know, what this supervisor did? And -- and you said yes, I don't favor it, I think it's bad, I think it's a bad idea, I -- as I understand your case, that's not opposition.",
  "And I don't see how that is changed at all when you put it in the context of a specific act of harassment as opposed to putting it in the context of harassment in general. You -- you -- if you're hiding behind the - - the defenses you've built up, it seems to me those defenses require something more than an expression of your opinion of whether it's good or bad. Your opinion is whether it's good or bad is not opposition.",
  "Well, I suppose your point would be it doesn't matter what the reason was that she didn't report it. In order to recover here she has to have taken a public stand; and whatever the reason why she didn't, the fact is that she didn't. Why do you get into, you know, the reason that she didn't?",
  "And -- and I suppose that you -- you would require the -- the opposition to be somehow a public -- a public expression of opposition. No?",
  "I mean, if one political candidate says that the other one opposed the war in Iraq, do you think the other candidate could say, that's a lie? I'm sorry, that the charge would be held to be correct if, in fact, the other candidate had never said anything about the war in Iraq, although deep in his heart he thought it was probably a bad idea. Would you say that he opposed the war in Iraq? I don't think so.",
  "The implication is - -",
  "The implication is that he came out with some public position opposing it, and that's your position as to the meaning of - -",
  "Why couldn't he -- I'm sorry, Chief Justice.",
  "I thought you were going to answer Justice Souter with the assertion that if indeed the Court wants employers to conduct these investigations, it does not want to reduce the incentive to do so. And the rule that is urged by the other side means whenever the -- whenever the employer conducts such an investigation, any employee who is smart enough to come in and testify against -- against sexual harassment has a guaranteed job. It is almost like - - almost like being a Federal judge.",
  "You can't be fired after that, or the employer can't fire her without opening himself up to a lawsuit under -- under this provision. And he might win the lawsuit, but it's going to cost money. So why -- maybe an employer would rather say, you know, I'd rather roll the dice and -- and not conduct an investigation and insulate all of my hostile employees from -- from employment actions.",
  "Do you get your litigation fees if you win? If the plaintiff here loses, does she pay all the attorneys' fees that this employer has incurred on this litigation?",
  "So even when you win you lose.",
  "Isn't it true that financially it is always cost-free for the plaintiff because she has an attorney who is taking it on a contingent basis? Now, you could say it's not cost-free to the lawyer; but even that's not always true because if the lawyer has nothing else to do he may as well be doing this, you know, whatever the odds are.",
  "You think the language \"investigation under this title\" is the equivalent of \"investigation with respect to an alleged offense under this title\"? That doesn't strike me as self-evident at all. It seems to me \"investigation under this title\" to me means an investigation under this title, which is not an investigation by the employer.",
  "Say it again? I'm not sure I - -",
  "Look, the problem you face -- and maybe you're being whipsawed -- is that you are effectively estopped from the argument that no EIS is necessary by the fact that you have agreed to these alternative arrangements. But you should not be estopped from arguing that at the time the EA was issued that was not a good faith completion of all the Navy's responsibilities. And that's the argument that is being made against you now. It assumes that the EA wasn't enough. And I'm not sure that we -- that that assumption is valid.",
  "Well, yes, you do, but it may not be in the circuits. Our cases say that procedural injury alone is not the kind of injury that confers standing; that there has to be some concrete harm.",
  "And -- and the only injury that -- that follows from the mere failure to file an EIS is -- is a procedural injury that affects the entire population.",
  "The EA demonstrates in your view that the EIS would -- would very likely say that this -- this action by the Navy is okay. And since that is the case, there is -- there is no probability of irreparable harm; to the contrary, there is the probability of no irreparable harm because of the EA.",
  "In all -- in all of these cases it is controverted, or in most of them, whether an EIS is either necessary -- is even necessary. So if the mere allegation that it was necessary gives rise to an allegation of irreparable harm, you are going to get a preliminary injunction in all cases?",
  "I -- I didn't assert that they are -- that they are the same thing substantively. My -- my only question is whether your assertion of bad faith on -- on the part of the Navy holds water so long as they were doing an EA. If -- you do an EA to see if an EIS is necessary. And you say if there's no -- if there is no significant harm to the environment, you don't even need an EIS.",
  "And that's how they started. That's step one, and many agencies do that. They are authorized to do that. I don't know why you have to attribute bad faith to the Navy simply because it began with an EA.",
  "Excuse me. That irreparable harm is the assessment of -- for purposes of the injunction -- refers to the same harm that is the harm which is the basis for standing, is it not?",
  "That's unfortunately contrary to what our opinions have said, which was quite clearly that procedural - -",
  "-- procedural injury is not the kind of injury that gives rise to Article III standing.",
  "The whole country can complain about the failure to issue an EIS. That is not the kind of injury that gives standing.",
  "Can I -- before you sit down. I thought I recalled something in your briefing dealing with the beaching -- your friend made a point regarding the beaching of beaked whales, that very substantially showed that they were caused by sonar. You had something in your briefs about beaching, but I wasn't sure whether it was beaked whales or only dolphins.",
  "In a particular case, I suppose.",
  "I don't understand -- I don't understand your response. If -- if someone has an interest in -- in stopping a particular action that would be governed by -- by -- by this general regulation, surely that person could -- and is -- is - - is threatened proximately by that action, that person could certainly bring an action seeking to stop the action on the ground that this regulation is invalid.",
  "And that would govern that particular action, but it would also be -- be precedent for invalidating the regulation in other cases. I - - presumably other courts would -- would similarly say that the regulation is invalid.",
  "Suppose the statute says anybody in the country can sue to stop a violation of the due -- due process clause. Would that statute be valid?",
  "The Article III requirements cannot be eliminated by Congress?",
  "Mr. Kneedler, I don't even agree with you that a -- that a citizen-wide notice provision confers standing, because it's close to the APA.",
  "Close -- close to the FOIA. In FOIA, an individual citizen demands a certain document which the law entitles that person to. This is a concrete deprivation - -",
  "Of something concrete. And - -",
  "Well, I thought you were doing it. And I certainly don't - -",
  "What if there -- what if there was not a regulation on this subject, but the agency, by its constant practice, applies a certain procedure in all of these cases, would you have it - - the power in the abstract to challenge the agency's consistent application of a certain procedure? You could certainly do it in a particular case, if the agency did something that was unlawful, you could certainly challenge it? But let's assume you don't have a particular case, you just object to the fact that in all of its cases the agency is doing this thing that is wrong. Will you have standing to challenge that?",
  "You would have standing?",
  "Your complaint is I don't like the way the agency behaves?",
  "Why do you make a difference with respect to the regulation? Why does the mere fact that this agency lawlessness happens to be reflected in a regulation, why does that suddenly alter the standing calculation? You either have been harmed or you haven't been harmed.",
  "Is that all it says? No, I think it speaks of categories across the board that affect -- that immediately, concretely affect the person complaining of the regulation, which is the case in these areas where you have a regulation requiring drug companies to have certain -- on pain of criminal penalty to print certain things on labels. That immediately affects them. I think that is what footnote 2 is about, not about -- not about any regulation that is across the board. That wouldn't make any sense. Where is footnote 2. Let's read it.",
  "You need a permit to have a Christmas tree? Where is this?",
  "I know what you're talking about.",
  "That's not unusual. I mean, standing looks not just to harm that has already been suffered but to harm that is imminent. And if these people are regular bidders and they say, you know, I'm likely to bid on this next project, that's fine. But these people are -- you don't know any specific project. They are just people interested in forests throughout the United States.",
  "That's quite different from saying, \"I am about to suffer harm, imminent harm, to me.\" I don't see anything -- you know, anything except in the case that was settled that has that kind of a connection.",
  "Tell me the two cases again that you are relying on for this.",
  "And what's that? What's the cite for it? Now, getting back to the ripeness issue in particular, as we go through the list of cases, it seems that the facial challenges have always been permitted in situations similar to this. The key question is, has it been applied? So National Parks Conservation Association hasn't been applied. No prediction that it might be applied, therefore not ripe. Thomas v. Union Carbide, I think, is particularly instructive because there the case preceding that was held unripe because there had not yet been an arbitration under the federal insecticide law. But by the time the case came to the Court, there had been an arbitration that had passed, and on that basis the Court said yes, this is a ripe controversy because here it's been applied, and there was no finding of mootness even though that arbitration was done, and that's the same situation that we have here.",
  "Can I ask you about Northeastern Florida? I have dug that out. I don't think it -- it supports what you say. In its complaint what was going on here is that there was a -- a minority business preference adopted by the City of Jacksonville, and some contractors who were not minorities sued saying that this was in -- in violation of the Constitution. And what happened -- what the Court said about standing was in its complaint petitioner alleged that many of its members regularly bid on and perform construction works. Now, if it had stopped there it might fit your case, but then it went on to say, \"and that they would have bid on designated set-aside contracts but for the restrictions imposed.\" As I read the case there were designated contracts, of which they said we would have bid on them but we didn't because of this -- what the case involved was the assertion by the city that you don't have standing unless you can show you would have been awarded the contract. And we said, no, no, you don't have to be awarded it, but if indeed you were -- you would have been a bidder in that contract but for this law, that's enough for standing. So that's not this case.",
  "Do you have racially polarized voting when you have as high a crossover vote as 40 percent? I mean, you say, we apply the normal Gingles factors, but it seems to me 40 percent crossover is fairly high.",
  "But you still think that we can confidently say this is racially polarized?",
  "Well, we -- what you propose is going to inject courts into the drawing of districts much more frequently than they -- than they already are injected. The reality is that one of the factors -- you mentioned contiguousness and county lines and so forth, but one of the factors that legislators always take into account is incumbent protection and the incumbent is always going to rather be in an 80 percent district than in a so-called 40 percent coalition district. I think you are unrealistic to expect State legislatures to draw districts that way, where everybody will have a chance. The whole object of it is that nobody will have a chance, just the incumbents. That's what is going on.",
  "Well, that's fine, but you just can't wave a magic wand. It -- Congress also intended primarily to leave it up to the legislatures under guidelines, to be sure. And when you have a choice of one 80 percent or two or even three 40 percent, it's clear to me what the legislature is going to -- going to choose.",
  "We will be injected into this very political game much more frequently than we now are. I have always regarded the 50 percent Gingles thing as simply a self-protection prescription for the courts, where you can look, you can be clear and say, you know, close enough for government work. But if you want us to figure out whether there could be three districts, two districts instead of just one district, you are just, it seems to me, tossing the whole -- the whole project of drawing districts into the courts. And that is -- that is not something that I, for one, favor.",
  "I'm sorry, what -- what's the color of the brief -- of the cover on this? Is it the brown one or the white one?",
  "130a?",
  "Well, but it -- it, by reason of the unusual law at issue here -- -I think it's unusual, I don't -- I'm unaware of any other State that has one -- the sentences -- the defendant has an entitlement to have the sentences run concurrently unless a certain additional fact exists and that additional fact is to be found by the judge rather than by the jury. So that if you take seriously what -- what we have said in prior cases, namely that any fact which has the effect of lengthening the sentence to which the defendant is entitled must be found by the jury -- if you take that seriously, I don't see why it doesn't apply here.",
  "How many others? Do you know?",
  "You know, this fact can - - can turn out to be the most significant fact for the defendant. I mean, it could lengthen his sentence enormously. It's more important than many of the other facts that we leave to the jury.",
  "But you could say the same about sentencing in general, and we held that the Sixth Amendment does impose a limitation upon judicial power where at least there is an entitlement by law to a certain lower sentence. And there we said you can't leave it to the judge to decide whether the facts that trigger that law exist or not.",
  "So I gather from your argument that you would -- you would be taking the other side and you would be saying that it has to go to the jury if, instead of being a statute that applies to concurrent sentences from various crimes, there was added to a particular crime, if this crime was committed with the use of a gun, any sentence imposed shall not run concurrently but shall run consecutively with any other sentence arising out of this same occurrence?",
  "There it's attached to a particular crime. Do you really think that we should have a different result in that case from this one?",
  "You could say the same thing about the length of the sentence, that it was up to them and they considered a wide array of facts. So what? We said in Apprendi, once you try to narrow it by law and say they can't do more than this, once you do that, that fact has to be found by the jury. And that's what's going on here.",
  "But you could say the same in Apprendi. It was a judicial determination how much of a sentence you were going to get from ten years to life. It wasn't up to the jury. It was up to the judge.",
  "And yet when you constrain the judge and you say, judge, you cannot give more than 20 years unless the crime was committed with a -- with a gun, we said suddenly that that matter can no longer be left to the judge. It's a matter of law, and the facts must be found by the jury. And I don't see any difference here. I mean in both cases it was traditionally done by judges.",
  "It's a lot easier to limit it to sentence than it is to limit it to sentence for a particular conviction as opposed to sentence for the whole ball of wax, all of the -- all of the horribles that Justice Breyer proposes would -- would be overcome if -- if you just adopted a rule that only applies to sentences.",
  "Mr. Lannet, in -- in connection with Justice Ginsburg's question, do you think that Apprendi would apply differently to a statute which, instead of imposing a higher penalty for a crime committed with a firearm, said that the penalty will be 30 years for burglary unless the defendant did not commit the crime with a firearm, in which case it will be 15 years? Do you think if the -- if the statute were framed in that way, that Apprendi would not apply and we would leave it to the judge whether a firearm had been used or not?",
  "Well, regardless of who proved it, I mean, the issue is can it be left to the judge to decide whether the -- the -- the beneficent determination that he did not use a firearm could be left to the judge instead of sending it to the jury?",
  "I don't see a dime's worth of difference between that and Apprendi.",
  "Booker/Fanfan as well, as adopted, right? I mean that was what the dissenters in Booker/Fanfan would have - -",
  "The core question is is the defendant entitled, entitled, to get no more than a certain penalty if a particular fact is found.",
  "And the answer would be, yes, he is entitled if the fact is found that he didn't use a gun to get a lesser penalty. And once you bring in the legal entitlement, as I understand Apprendi, it means that it has to be found by the jury.",
  "No entitlement to a lesser sentence?",
  "Do that again, will you?",
  "Why do you say in light of the jury finding when you have disavowed any necessity that the jury had found this?",
  "I mean \"in light of the jury finding,\" why don't you just drop that.",
  "Why just a homicide? What was -- what was the indictment here? What was he tried for?",
  "Why wouldn't assault with a deadly weapon suffice or, alternatively, why would you have to know that it was first degree murder or second degree murder? I don't know how you get from the text of the Washington statute that all you have to know is that it was a homicide?",
  "But -- but he wasn't prosecuted for homicide. I mean, the crimes are much more specific - -",
  "-- first degree murder, second degree murder.",
  "How does that appear from the statute? If I read the statute, I would have thought that you have to have knowledge that he was - - would negligent homicide suffice?",
  "Where is that? Is that in the charge to the jury?",
  "It's not in the court's charges.",
  "Did -- hadn't other Washington State courts made a similar error in their interpretation of the Washington statutes?",
  "And the same -- and hadn't the prosecutors in Washington in misstating the standard the same way and using \"In for a dime, in for a dollar\" to mean precisely the wrong thing, namely that even if you were in for beating him up that's enough for holding you liable for homicide?",
  "Including this one in an earlier case.",
  "The only reason I raise it is, is to show that this jury was obviously perplexed on the point. It asked for further instructions three times on this precise point, what did -- did he have to know. And all the trial judge did was say read, you know, read my instructions, which essentially recited the statute. And what all of what you've just acknowledged shows is that reading the statute doesn't help a whole lot. It doesn't clarify. It doesn't, it doesn't correct any misimpression that the prosecutor could have created.",
  "Let's look at -- where is that?",
  "In the white?",
  "You -- you know, you are taking on more of a burden than you have to. And you could say, yes, it would be reasonable to say that, but it would also be reasonable to say -- to say otherwise, right?",
  "It's not objectively unreasonable to say the opposite.",
  "But when -- when would there be a tort remedy? What -- what situation would you envision?",
  "What if they found out about new information which would, if properly considered, alter what the labeling ought to be? Would there be a tort remedy for the failure to bring that new information to the attention of - -",
  "You mean if you failed to provide the FDA the new information that you think negates the provisions on the -- on the label, you still couldn't be sued?",
  "What if -- what if you brought it to the FDA's attention and the FDA just hasn't acted on it? You would be authorized to change the label on your own.",
  "I understand, but in the interim, you could -- could you be subject to a State tort suit for not changing the label when -- when you had the power to do so?",
  "You can supplement only when there is new information?",
  "Excuse me. Those -- those risks were set forth on the labeling approved by the FDA. Surely that sentence means it shall be revised to include a warning as soon, as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard that the FDA has not considered. And that is not already addressed on the labeling. I mean to read it as -- as opening up stuff that's already been considered by the FDA would -- would -- would make a -- a mush out of it.",
  "Well, you're just contradicting the label. The fact is they could not have approved that label unless they made that determination. Now, if you're telling me the FDA acted irresponsible -- irresponsibly, then sue the FDA.",
  "But the labeling made it very clear that the preferred method of administering this medicine was -- was -- was muscular and -- and that there were serious risks involved in -- in the IV push. Moreover, your client didn't follow the labeling or your client's physician didn't follow the labeling prescription for IV push, did he?",
  "No. No. Wait, wait. He administered a -- a level of the drug that was vastly in excess of -- of -- of what the labeling said could safely be used for IV push.",
  "Had no bearing. Are you serious?",
  "You established that there were new problems? I mean, if there were new problems, then -- then they could have simply supplemented the labeling. But did you establish that there were problems that had not been considered already by the FDA? I mean, the labeling says, you know, that this is dangerous to use -- use IV push. It made it very clear that it's dangerous.",
  "It proposed a more restrictive label to the FDA, didn't it? And the FDA said, no, you use this label. In other words, it's - - what you're saying was not its call. It was the call of the FDA.",
  "What if it referred to new drug risks, then, in your preceding sentence, where you are saying manufacturers change it all the time as new drug risks become apparent?",
  "What you mean is whether or not new drug risks become apparent, they have to change, right?",
  "And -- and is entitled to amend the labeling automatically.",
  "I envision a -- a scheme under which manufacturers who are worried about jury liability of -- of the magnitude that occurred in this case saying, gee, why should we take chances? And every time there is a jury verdict on some -- on some other - - some other ground not -- not prohibited by the label, they just add that to the label; and they submit it to -- to the FDA and the -- and until -- unless and until the FDA conducts an investigation and disapproves that label, that labeling change occurs. How many -- how many -- you mentioned a number of -- of times that -- that label alterations are -- are proposed. I mean, this is going to be a massive operation for the FDA.",
  "It would not promote public safety if you believe that the name of this game is balancing benefits and costs.",
  "And if you are simply eliminating certain drugs which people who -- who have real desperate need for could -- could be benefited by, you're not benefiting the public.",
  "And that applies even if it's approved by the FDA?",
  "You're saying FDA approval doesn't -- doesn't give you any protection at all?",
  "But -- but -- but the marketing may be a misbranding?",
  "Well then, gee, then all of the qualifications you were making earlier about whether it's new information or a new assessment, that's irrelevant.",
  "You're saying whenever it's unsafe, whatever the FDA has approved, you have a lawsuit.",
  "There -- there was nothing about new information in what you just said. You said it's misbranded if it's not safe, new information or not.",
  "Is that -- is that -- is that your position?",
  "If that's a fair statement then you have to retract your -- your earlier assertion that whenever it's not safe it's misbranded. I mean - -",
  "-- which is it? Whenever it's not safe, it's misbranded, or what you just responded to Justice Souter?",
  "But the label doesn't. I mean, the label ask discusses the high risk from IV push and sets forth particular cautions for that -- for that specific means of administration.",
  "Of course, I suppose if the phrase \"now under the jurisdiction of the United States\" did not have any clear meaning when the statute was enacted, it -- it wouldn't have any clear meaning for the future, either. So you don't -- you don't solve that problem by reading \"now\" to mean \"then,\" right?",
  "Yes. I'm saying it doesn't help if you do what the Government suggests. That doesn't give any clearer content to the meaning of being under Federal jurisdiction. It is still going to have to be worked out somehow. The question is whether you work it out and apply it as of the time of the statute or work it out and apply it time by time.",
  "Where -- where were you reading from? I - -",
  "That's what's causing me confusion there. You're talking about -- I wish we would just use the statutory numbers, but do what you like.",
  "Thank you.",
  "What section are we talking about -- 19? Or are we talking about some other number?",
  "I assume that you think \"Indian\" modifies \"organized band\" and \"pueblo\" as well.",
  "Where -- where was this interesting conversation? Was it even on the floor of the Congress? It couldn't have been, because one of the members wasn't a Congressman, right?",
  "It was at a hearing, oh.",
  "He can include anybody else? He can include, for example, people who are only one quarter-Indian blood, even though, you know, they went to the trouble of defining it as 50 percent Indian blood?",
  "Very strange statute, just leaving it up to him to do whatever he wants.",
  "So -- so there is no limitations. It includes this and it also includes whatever else he wants. Is that it?",
  "That's -- that's a very strange reading of \"shall include\" when you're dealing with a word that does not itself have any solid content. When you're dealing with a word that's pretty much self-defining, yes, you can say \"shall include this,\" because what in addition is included is -- is pretty clear. But these words have virtually no -- no content; and if you say \"shall include\" means, you know, it has this, I'm still left with well, what else does it have? I can't believe that the statute was meant to be that expansive, to let the Secretary buy land for whomever he wanted.",
  "It's pretty clear what the Court thought it meant, though, isn't it? Whether it's dictum or not, it's pretty clear that the Court thought it clearly enough meant that, that they were willing to say bracket -- you know.",
  "I agree.",
  "I agree.",
  "It suggests that it's not very ambiguous, I think.",
  "I'm interested -- I'm interested in the Secretary's conclusion that recognized \"tribe\" and \"tribe now under Federal jurisdiction\" are one and the same; that the words are used redundantly. Does he know the rule that we usually don't -- I guess he doesn't because he interprets \"now\" to mean nothing. Does he understand that we usually do not interpret words to have no meaning? Why would they say both if they both mean the same thing?",
  "\"Recognized tribe under Federal jurisdiction,\" that, to me, means two different requirements.",
  "I don't -- I don't understand how you say that -- that the term \"tribe\" has no limitation to Indians. \"The term 'tribe,' whenever used in this Act, shall be construed to refer to any Indian tribe, organized band or Pueblo, or the Indians residing on one reservation.\"",
  "Well, it's -- I mean circular definitions are nothing unusual in the legislation that Congress comes up with.",
  "What meaning -- what meaning do you think the sentence has when it says: \"The term 'tribe' shall be construed to refer to any Indian tribe, organized band, Pueblo, or the Indians residing on one reservation\"?",
  "How can you interpret that not to be limited to Indian tribes?",
  "Are there -- are there in counties some charitable drives that occur annually and that permit employees to donate to those charities through deductions from their wages?",
  "And would they presumably be covered by this? United Fund drives, so-called, my -- my recollection is that usually the contributions to that simply come out of -- are deducted from the wages. And if they existed in the counties, presumably they would have been covered. But we don't know if they would.",
  "Oh, it's only political activities?",
  "I see. Well, none of those would allow that - -",
  "Would -- would they include contributions to an organization that makes contributions to political parties - -",
  "-- such as a right-to work-organization?",
  "Does the State give some particular favor to unions? I mean, does it allow - - what -- what is the situation? Can you be forced to contribute to the union even though you're not a union member?",
  "But unions do have a special prerogative which -- which no other organizations, as far as you're aware, have in the State, which is to have money deducted from people's payrolls?",
  "Yes. The point of my question is it doesn't seem to be terribly discriminatory if indeed the only organizations in the State that are given the right, whether by Federal or State law, to deduct, private organizations, given the right to deduct from the salary a municipal or private employer pays. It doesn't seem to me particularly discriminatory to say that, moreover, in making those deductions, no part of it will be given for political activities. I mean you're only addressing a narrow class, but it's a narrow class that has a special benefit.",
  "What about a Hatch Act? Does -- does -- does the State allow State employees to engage in political activity?",
  "I don't know -- I don't know what that means.",
  "That's interesting. Why not?",
  "Mr. Collins, suppose -- I gather Idaho doesn't have it, but suppose Idaho wanted a Hatch Act similar to the Federal Hatch Act that prohibits Federal employees from engaging in political activity, and suppose it decided that not only should the State employees at the capital not engage in political activities, but it's a problem for any governmental employee to do that; they ought to be neutral and we don't want patronage to be passed out on the basis of whether they are campaigning for one party or another, and we don't want them to be coerced into campaigning for one party or another. Now, I assume that such a law would violate the First Amendment if it were extended to all employers. Saying no -- no company employee, no private employee can engage in political activity would surely violate the First Amendment. Would it violate the First Amendment if it was extended? Certainly, it doesn't when it's applied to State employees because there are a lot of State Hatch Acts. And you're saying it would violate the First Amendment as applied to county and municipal employees?",
  "Why not?",
  "You're saying -- you're analogizing these to private entities. That's your whole point.",
  "This is not a creature of the State. You're saying what the First Amendment -- as the First Amendment applies to private individuals, so it applies here. This is regulation by the State, rather than the State's control of State government.",
  "Well, but common law would have treated it that way, you say?",
  "That's pretty good authority.",
  "What's a SWU? You lost me on the SWU. What's a SWU?",
  "If you put in more time with the uranium, with the same amount of 235, if you put in more time you can get out more?",
  "And those have been cases where the very same product is returned with value added, right?",
  "No, old mills used to do that. The farmer used to take his harvest to the mill, and it would be ground right there while he was waiting.",
  "That's absolutely true.",
  "Your brief constantly assumes that there has been no sale, that throughout the entire transaction, the utility owned what ultimately becomes the rods, as though it was indeed the same feedstock that produced the rod that was ultimately delivered. And that is simply not true. There is a change -- there is a change of ownership. The feedstock that somebody else put into the mix is now transferred to the -- to the electric utility.",
  "That's exactly right. You don't know. So, you had cannot say that there has been no transfer of ownership.",
  "No, we've got the same molecules. I mean, when you are talking about whether there has been a transfer of ownership or a transfer of title, you are talking about molecules; you are not talking about whether you ended up the same in, you know, in monetary terms. You are talk about whether you have the same thing that you delivered to the person overseas. And you don't, or at least you can't say that you do.",
  "That makes no sense, what you just said. That contract makes no sense. They hold title to it until they get the uranium rods, right?",
  "Most of it is back overseas. It's still mixed with the other fungible U 235.",
  "Ms. Halligan, try this hypothetical, and it really gives you the benefit of the doubt. Let's assume a department store buys raw wool from some sheep herder, sends it overseas. And it's worth $1,000, this raw wool. It is processed, spun and knitted into sweaters, and then shipped back to the department store. The sweaters, all made from the same wool, not even fungible, so that's why this is even better than your example -- the sweaters when they come back, are worth not $1,000, but $20,000. Do you think it would be unreasonable for the Commerce Department to treat that as a sale of sweaters by the European knitting wool or -- or home knitters who did the sweaters?",
  "Say it again?",
  "I'm talking about the -- I'm talking about the sale from the European mills to the American department store.",
  "A processing transaction. It has changed a value of $1,000 into a value of -- what did I say -- $20,000? And that's just processing?",
  "They said there was no sale.",
  "When the pasta was imported, there was no sale into the United States.",
  "But that's what we are talking about here.",
  "Get back to your pasta case. Was the holding of that case that there was no sale into the United States?",
  "That's a different issue. We are not talking here about which transaction establishes the price. We are talking simply about whether there was a sale into the United States.",
  "Now, wait. Suppose these knitting mills in my example, in fact, are selling their sweaters for a much higher price in Europe. Instead of $20,000 for this batch of wool, in Europe they are selling it for $40,000. And they nonetheless sell the wool back into the United States for only $20,000. You are telling me that that transaction doesn't -- doesn't count for purposes of our antidumping law?",
  "That you have to look at the price at which the department store then sells to individuals?",
  "But the department store is not dumping. It's -- it's the knitting mills that are dumping.",
  "Okay. And accepting that, you -- you have to begin the whole thing, however, with a sale, with a sale into the United States, right?",
  "And I thought this is - - this is what you say fails in this case. That is the link of the chain that doesn't exist. You say there is no sale in the United States.",
  "What does -- what does the government do with respect to these other transactions where, indeed, the utility does not provide the feed uranium but just pays for, you know, getting -- getting the rods?",
  "There is no down -- you know, there is no domestic sale there, either. Is it conceivable that there, therefore, can be no dumping in such a case?",
  "Did it -- did it reconsider its policy? In the first order, I would -- I would have gathered that it had, but its second order said basically, we've never had a policy that single use of these expletives is okay. Which is it? Are they changing their policy or not?",
  "The latest order, the one that's up here, says that all of the statements to that effect in the past were simply staff statements and that the Commission had never held to that effect before.",
  "But I think it rewrote that in its last order, and I think it even explained away the Golden Globe statement by saying it was not as categorical as it might appear.",
  "Which is, indeed, why it's used.",
  "Although they don't, I gather.",
  "Because they find it offensive, I gather.",
  "They had a 5-second delay at the time these things occurred, didn't they?",
  "And it wasn't -- it wasn't that they weren't fast enough or something?",
  "Right, right.",
  "It depends on whom you are dealing with, right?",
  "This Paris Hilton incident was scripted. The use of the indecent word was almost invited, wasn't it?",
  "But it was sort of an invitation. I mean, before she was introduced, said, \"Now we're on live television, you have to watch your mouth\", or something like that.",
  "It was a setup.",
  "But you didn't fine them, anyway, did you?",
  "Oh, it's funny. I mean, bawdy jokes are okay if they are really good.",
  "Are they -- are they supposed to be more virtuous than courts?",
  "I mean, courts all the time, you know, distinguish prior cases by saying, \"well, you know, it was dictum, or we didn't really hold that and whatnot. \" And I read their opinion as somewhat the same -- somewhat the same thing. They acknowledge at the end, and that's why they didn't impose a fine, that although this, you know, nothing that they had done up till now -- although their staff had -- would have misled anybody; still and all, it wasn't all that clear, and therefore we won't impose a fine. It seems to me - -",
  "It - -",
  "Well -- it was also, they said, you know, we sort of made this change without getting comments from the affected parties.",
  "Give us a chance to receive comments and then -- and then explain.",
  "They said that. They gave the reason for their current belief. They said even when it is used just as a swear word or as an expletive, the reason it has its impact is precisely because it refers to these excretory or sexual activities; that's what -- that's what gives -- gives it its zing.",
  "Of course there is.",
  "Don't use golly waddles in -- instead of the F-Word.",
  "And I thought we've held that the Court can't engage in such expansion of and additions to the Administrative Procedure Act. I thought that was - -",
  "-- one of our landmark decisions that what it says, it says, and we cannot add additional procedures. You are suggesting we add an additional procedure that when it deals with speech, the explanation has to be really good.",
  "Not just - -",
  "You are asking for a higher standard than the APA - -",
  "You should have complained to the lower court about that. You should have said, please don't decide this on the APA issue. This is a First Amendment case. You should reach the constitutional issue.",
  "But you went on the APA issue, and then you come up here and say: I don't want to -- I don't want to discuss the APA; I want to discuss, you know, the First Amendment.",
  "The APA simpliciter; not the APA, you know - -",
  "He does good stuff now and then.",
  "These arguments apply not just to the isolated, once-upon-a-time use, but even to continued use. You could say the same thing about just filling a program with these expletives, right?",
  "That's not - -",
  "That's not, I suppose, what you are arguing against here, is it?",
  "There goes Pacifica.",
  "Isn't that a - -",
  "Isn't that a heckler's veto?",
  "What if people like, you know, going on and on with expletives and offensive words? Are those of us who are offended by that hecklers and you can't take our positions into account because you're giving effect to a heckler? I mean -- I don't think so.",
  "Do you think your clients have had anything to do with that?",
  "You do, indeed, but you don't have them presented as something that is -- is normal in polite company, which is what happens when it comes out in -- in television shows. This is a coarsening of manners that is -- that is produced by - - by the shows. So I am -- you know, I -- I am not persuaded by the argument that people are more accustomed to hearing these words than they were in the past.",
  "More tolerant or more used to hearing it?",
  "Candidly, I think there is a difference.",
  "Let me ask about deferring there. You seem to be suggesting that since there is a criminal penalty for a violation of this statute, the agency has no role in -- in defining what -- what the terms of the statute mean.",
  "Suppose it is denied by - - by the State court. And suppose it's denied by the State court more -- more than a year after the conclusion of the original proceeding. What -- what is the consequence then?",
  "Suppose he institutes it, however, within the year.",
  "That's assuming that he files the appeal within one year, right?",
  "What if he doesn't?",
  "Yes.",
  "The game is over.",
  "What if he doesn't find out about the fact that notice, proper notice, wasn't given to his counsel, so he doesn't find out about the gravamen for the appeal until after a year?",
  "Right. Right.",
  "I don't think (d)(1)(B) does. It requires an impediment to have been removed. There is no impediment being removed. He just didn't find out the facts.",
  "Right. Right.",
  "I just made one up. I mean, it's a hypothetical.",
  "There is more of a problem than that, as the other side just said. (1)(B), which is the gimmick you are using to get out of this, doesn't speak of not being able to find out in time; it speaks of the date on which the impediment to file an application - -",
  "-- is removed.",
  "Oh, you said (D), not (B).",
  "The problem with (1)(D) is that the claim or claims presented that is referred to in (D) is not the denial of the appeal. It's the claim or claims that he wants to bring in his Federal habeas. That's why (1)(D) doesn't work, you have to go back to I'm talking to you.",
  "But that's your fault.",
  "Convicted felons don't always make intelligent decisions, you are saying.",
  "Mr. Pincus, could I ask about your description of the Government's position as saying that it's purely objective and that there's no mental factor whatever. Is it clear that the Government not only would not take into account coercion, the fact that it was done under coercion, but also would not take into account the fact that the individual even knew?",
  "-- that he was persecuting somebody?",
  "Has the Government taken that position here in in this case?",
  "I guess I should ask the Government?",
  "I could think that that's wrong without thinking that you also have to take into account whether there was coercion.",
  "Well, but it's very -- - it's very common in -- in criminal statutes to require knowledge of the act. Indeed, if the person doesn't know what he's doing, you know, he may be insane, but he's not a criminal. Whereas, it is not automatically clear that the fact that the -- you killed somebody because otherwise they'd break your arm would -- would be a justification. I mean, it seems to me the two are quite separable.",
  "So you wouldn't balance. So, you know, gas these 20,000 people or we will kill you?",
  "You gas the 20,000 people, right, and that's okay?",
  "Well, to give the devil his due, it's not just the BIA that took that view, it's every court of appeals that -- that has looked at this provision has said that Fedorenko is a guide to what it means, right?",
  "So you are faulting the BIA for -- you are saying it's beyond reasonable interpretation for the BIA to adopt the -- the resolution of the ambiguity, assuming there is an ambiguity, which comports with every court of appeals to address the matter has said?",
  "Why do you think that's clear? What's -- what's the text you rely on?",
  "Do I have it in front of me?",
  "Well, gee. I mean, if this is central to your case, don't you think I ought to have the language in front of me somewhere?",
  "Wonderful.",
  "It's a \"see\" citation, right?",
  "Well, I mean, you know, it's just not a flat citation which would say that governs. It means this is a relevant case that you should look to. And you don't deny that it's relevant. You try to distinguish it, but it's certainly something you should consider, no?",
  "And that's all you have to say that they -- they based it on Fedorenko?",
  "That's not very much.",
  "It's a \"see\" cite again, isn't it?",
  "All right, that's good.",
  "You say \"Citing Matter of Laipenieks\"?",
  "Citing it. It says \"citing Matter of Laipenieks.\" Do you know if they cited it just flatly or was it a \"see\" cite?",
  "Do you want to bet?",
  "Mr. Pincus, can you tell me: What is the consequence of this? I mean if, indeed, your client is -- is denied asylum because - - because he participated in -- in, under coercion or not, discriminatory action against others, what is the consequence? He is not sent back to the -- to the country that -- that is persecuting him, is he? Well, his -- his deportation has been deferred under the Convention Against Torture. So he has some -- some protection, not the protection, not the full protections that he would be entitled to if he were found to be a refugee.",
  "What -- what happens to him? Does he -- does he stay here or - -",
  "Until some other country other than the one that will persecute him will receive him, is that -- is that it?",
  "Oh, really?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, if I claim I would be subject to persecution in Denmark if I were sent there, that might be an easy question. But they typically come from a country where there is persecution, and they could easily have been subjected to it, or they could also just as easily have read about it or heard about it in -- along their way here. You think that's an easy determination?",
  "Your unprovable question upon unprovable question. I mean, to say that one question is really, really hard to figure out is no justification for laying on another one.",
  "Mr. Pincus, I didn't -- I didn't get the bottom line of your exchange with Justice Breyer. Is it your position that there -- there has to be some -- some coercion defense, but it's up to the Attorney General to say what it is? I mean, he could say only if he were threatened with death?",
  "And only if you were threatened with torture, not if it was threatened that your family would be exterminated? Where do you get that discretion in the -- in the statute?",
  "Any old coercion defense he can do -- make. So long as there is some coercion defense, that's all you want. Some coercion defense?",
  "You said -- you never get past step one of Chevron. You say that this statute is clear. You say it's not ambiguous.",
  "I think it's pretty ambiguous if, you know, there is some old coercion defense, but we don't really know what it is.",
  "It seems to me if you are going to say step one is clear, there has to be some coercion defense that -- you know, of -- of a substantial nature that the Attorney General cannot fritter away.",
  "Mr. Katsas, can I bring you back to Aristotle?",
  "Thank you. This is not a criminal statute.",
  "The government is not imposing punishment upon this person - -",
  "-- for some malfeasance. Rather, it's -- it's giving a grant of a great benefit - -",
  "-- to a class of people. And your position is that it has narrowed that class, perhaps now more than was necessary, but that the government thought that, rather than letting in and giving asylum to the commandant of Trebenko, it would be better to have a provision that simply excludes those who, under coercion or not, persecuted others. Isn't that - -",
  "Did Aristotle say anything about that? Limiting - -",
  "Limiting the nation's generosity on the basis of a provision that may or may not have anything to do with blame?",
  "That's very helpful.",
  "You -- can I get from you an answer to the question that I put to Mr. Pincus? Do you -- does the Government deny even the necessity of knowledge that what you are doing is assisting in the persecution of somebody? You don't even have to know that you are assisting in the persecution?",
  "Good for them. I mean, that is really an extreme position.",
  "Mr. Pincus, who has the burden of proof? Assume there is an exception for coercion.",
  "The applicant would. And -- and what -- how do you decide? There's not going to be any evidence on the other side, I assume. The applicant's going to say I was coerced. And -- and the only basis for rejecting is -- a sufficient basis is just, I -- \"I don't believe you\"?",
  "And do they have shifty eyes?",
  "That is certainly -- you know, that's an interesting theory, but it's certainly not the theory on which the decision below was based. The decision below says \"Neither\" -- speaking of Imbler and prior cases -- \"Neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has considered whether claims regarding failure to train, failure to supervise or failure to develop an officewide policy regarding a Constitutional obligation like the one set forth in Giglio are subject to absolute immunity.\" And I could quote portions of the opinion they are.",
  "They are talking about supervising prosecutors. They are talking about training prosecutors and having an officewide policy regarding what you do with -- with Giglio information.",
  "Page 5?",
  "They are not talking about just collecting information.",
  "They are talking about, as they clarify later on, a -- a system in which they train and supervise and develop an officewide policy regarding the Giglio obligations.",
  "There is really a problem about -- about what you suggest. It may destroy the whole benefit of the categorical approach. I mean, you can always shave something down to become a narrower crime. An escape statute, for example, I suppose you could look to see whether the particular escape in question from the charging document was an escape that used firearms or was an escape that, you know, that injured or killed guards. And, you know, that gets us into the case-by-case examination that it is the whole purpose of the categorical approach to avoid. Now, how do we -- how do we avoid getting to the bottom of that slippery slope?",
  "Okay. I mean, the charge mentions -- mentions a firearm. Anything that's in the charge can be used to narrow the crime that we are looking at.",
  "It has to be an element of the crime. If using a firearm is not an element of escape, then I don't have to worry about it.",
  "Okay, but it doesn't have to be an element. So, if all the evidence in the case was that, you know, he wrestled a gun from the guard and made his way out of the prison that way, if the jury found him guilty, that was the only basis on which it could have found him guilty, that would be enough.",
  "Well, that sounds like an element. That sounds like an element.",
  "Surely it depends upon how, how, what should I say, how often that prospect is realized.",
  "I mean, the statute itself lists robbery and robbery very often doesn't involve any threat of injury, but all and all we think it does. Obviously, Congress thought it did, right?",
  "I didn't mean to say robbery. I meant to say burglary. Why is burglary violent or aggressive?",
  "I mean, burglary by its nature is-- you do it at night. You don't want to be detected. It's not violent or aggressive at all. It's sneaky, is what it is.",
  "Robbery is violent or aggressive. You're quite right about that.",
  "Yes, but -- that may be, but it does not in its nature indicate violence or aggressiveness.",
  "It gets you right back into the soup. What you're saying is all it requires is that there be a potential for violence, for aggressiveness, right? And that's what the Government says here: There is a potential for violence and aggressiveness.",
  "That doesn't square with the answer you gave me with regard to burglary. If what you just said is true, burglary wouldn't be among the listed crimes.",
  "Say that again. I didn't understand it.",
  "But it's not common sense that the person who has been guilty of a crime so gentlemanly that they only made him report to prison on the weekends would confront the policeman with violence when he comes. This is not normally what you think of as a violent type who has -- who has been told to report weekends to the prison.",
  "But did he get additional time, by the way, when -- when they finally brought him back?",
  "So he just -- he just had to make up the weekends that he had lost?",
  "Well, this guy doesn't sound to me like Jack the Ripper. He really doesn't.",
  "But they didn't use a gun.",
  "The problem is you say if he had used a gun. And he didn't use a gun. I mean, to come up with your statistics on the basis of something that didn't happen is not using statistics; it's using imagination.",
  "What was he serving those weekends for? What was the crime?",
  "He just gets weekends for that? How many weekends?",
  "Pretty good deal.",
  "But -- but you would ask - - if a supervisor did it, what would you ask the supervisor? You'd say, you know, did you -- did you do this? Can you testify to your own knowledge that this is what the analysis showed? And he would have to say, no, it was one of my subordinates who did it, but I can tell you he was a very reliable person. How would that -- I don't understand how that would work.",
  "Mr. Fisher, how many States do things the way -- the way you would have them done? I mean, how many States don't have these -- these notice laws, but in fact bring in the analyst to -- to give the information?",
  "Well, they bring in witnesses if -- if defendants demand, but - -",
  "Mr. Fisher, I am interested in the history since that's what the Court held in Crawford, that the content of the Confrontation Clause is not what we would like it to be, but what it historically was when it was enshrined in the Constitution. As a matter of history, was there a business records exception, not from the hearsay rule but from the Confrontation Clause?",
  "Why isn't that a business records exception? I don't - -",
  "Oh, wait. You say it's - - that business records would often or usually not be testimonial?",
  "Would have been nontestimonial. So they'd come in on that basis, not because they were business records?",
  "I don't see the difference between the two. I mean, the one, he saw the blue car going down the street, which through other evidence can be connected to the defendant; and here the witness says this is cocaine, which through other evidence is going to be connected to the defendant. And in both cases that -- that connected fact is deemed essential by the prosecution for the conviction. I don't see the difference between the two.",
  "For the indictment, not - - not as -- not as independent evidence in the prosecution. It would form the basis for the indictment, as I understand what the history is. It would not be introduced and -- and -- and shown to the jury as evidence that -- that indeed the cause of death was thus and so.",
  "Ballistics as well? You would extend this to ballistic tests?",
  "You -- you don't have to bring in the ballistic expert? You can just - -",
  "I don't understand that difference.",
  "Why not? I know I prefer one thing, the custody. It's very important to know whether indeed this was the particular substance that was taken from the defendant. And to establish that, you have to establish a line of custody. And you can't do that without getting in the person who did the test.",
  "He says -- the policeman says, \"And I gave it to the University of Massachusetts lab.\"",
  "\"And I watched when they marked it in a particular way.\"",
  "How do I know that that thing is the one that got to the desk of the analyst who wrote this report?",
  "So you say you can require witnesses to show that, right up to the analyst who did the testing, you can require witnesses to testify? All the way up to there but not the analyst himself?",
  "No. No. They are admissible in criminal cases as far as the Confrontation Clause is concerned because they are not testimonial.",
  "We are back to Roberts then.",
  "Don't these people have to appear before the same judge again and again? The point made these are repeat attorneys, and I don't think you make friends and influence people among judges by insisting upon testimony in criminal cases where it is obviously not needed.",
  "But - -",
  "It's not material prepared for trial. It's not material that was generated precisely in order to prosecute an individual.",
  "Exactly.",
  "Let's, let's assume that it's critical to a particular murder prosecution what time the shot was fired, okay? And you mean to tell me if -- if somebody says I heard the clock strike 12 at the time the shot was fired, that would not be testimony? Yes, the clock is a machine, right?",
  "He is just reciting what the clock said.",
  "And there was not a broad exception at common law for public records created in anticipation of criminal litigation.",
  "Have you found cases where the material was admitted as a public record despite the fact that it was a public record created for prosecution?",
  "Well - -",
  "So you say they could introduce the squiggly line and put on the stand an analyst who says what that squiggly line shows is that this was cocaine?",
  "Well, Respondent says that may be because a lot of people in Congress wanted it to be a dead letter. They would have wanted the whole thing to be a dead letter. There are a lot of people who didn't like this statute because it was a gun control statute.",
  "Well, if it's a compromise with the people who wanted no statute at all and you come out with a statute that covers one-third of the States anyway, I mean that's, you know -- that's the deal.",
  "How do we know -- how do we know that?",
  "But it also substituted this structure that we are -- that we are discussing today. Didn't that come in at the same time?",
  "So, why -- why say it's only the former provision that was the compromise and not the addition of this later language?",
  "You can't. I mean, you have the \"that,\" and the \"that\" applies to both (i) and (ii), and this is part of (ii). I think you've got to either say \"that committed\" or -- or put in an \"is\" - - \"that is committed.\" It just doesn't parse, and that lack of parsing is much worse than the one that you - - you point to in the other side's reading. Yes, it's not usual to talk about committing a use of force, but it happens sometimes. It's -- it's not the most elegant language, but there are many examples of such usage that have been brought forth by the other side and by some of the amici. So they have something that -- it's not elegant, but people have spoken that way. Nobody speaks the way you want us to speak: \"An offense that committed by a person or an offense that\" -- \"committed by a current or former...\" Nobody talks that way.",
  "Nobody.",
  "I wouldn't agree with that. You'd still have the \"that\" up above. You would have to have a hard return and take out the \"that\" or -- or that (A) is a misdemeanor, \"has as an element\" and then a hard return, and you have to add \"and is committed.\" You still have to add language besides the hard return.",
  "I want to follow up on Justice Kennedy's inquiry about the rule of lenity. Don't you think the rule of lenity is particularly important when you're dealing with conduct that is not malum in se? I mean, to say that, well, we are not going to apply the rule of lenity to a statute that posits an increased sentence for kneecapping or for some violent conduct, the person knows he shouldn't be doing that stuff anyway. But this imposes a -- a -- a penalty for conduct that no one would think is unlawful. This fellow is -- wasn't it his father's gun he was taking to sell at a gun show or something?",
  "Well, he could have ten, couldn't he?",
  "Why?",
  "But -- but for this language that you say makes his owning of a firearm unlawful, it wouldn't be unlawful at all, would it? He would have no reason to think he couldn't have a firearm.",
  "Should be. Is that right?",
  "A misdemeanor -- a misdemeanor offense. And -- and -- and he should suspect that because he committed a misdemeanor, he cannot have a firearm?",
  "I don't think anybody would assume that. Indeed, there are some who assume that you -- you cannot prevent the owning of a firearm for a mere misdemeanor, as opposed to a felony.",
  "Make it clear. Make it clear, so that when -- when his lawyer pleads to the offense, he doesn't have to read in a little (iii) where there is not a little (iii). And he -- well, you did not plead guilty or you are not accused of the offense of using violence against a family member. You're just -- just accused of -- of using violence, a misdemeanor.",
  "What -- a serious violent offense. Are there -- is there felony assault and battery?",
  "And this was misdemeanor assault and battery, wasn't it?",
  "So it's not that serious an offense. That's why we call it a misdemeanor.",
  "Then he should have been charged with a felony, but he wasn't. He was charged with a misdemeanor.",
  "I think -- I think that people are governed by the law that is passed, not by the law that Congress intended to pass.",
  "So, really, if a lawyer reading this would not think that it applied, I don't care what Congress intended. If -- if the law doesn't say that, the person is not governed by it. You think a person could be governed by it despite the fact that it doesn't say that because Congress intended it?",
  "Of course.",
  "Well, wait. You say that that was the compromise. I don't know that you have any evidence to -- to show that that was an intentional - - an intentional alteration made in the House of Representatives. Do you? I mean - -",
  "But the other side says that the reason that was the case was that they objected to the fact that -- what was its language -- the -- the old version did not say a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\" It was -- it was broader.",
  "Where -- where is the earlier version? Do we have the earlier version anywhere - -",
  "-- in the materials in front of us?",
  "Thank you.",
  "Did this structure come from Senator Lautenberg?",
  "Where did it come from?",
  "It came out of the House version. The House version had this which was different from the Senate version that Lautenberg was responsible for?",
  "So this language came from the House?",
  "Excuse me, Senator Lautenberg would not have been the drafter of this language.",
  "What do you mean would have? Did it language come over to the Senate from the House or not?",
  "This very form that was ultimately enacted was the form that came over from the House to the Senate?",
  "I suppose it gives greater assurance of what exactly the prior conviction was. If there is just a prior conviction of misdemeanor violence, you have to go back, I suppose, and look at the conviction, look at the testimony to find out whether indeed it was domestic violence. It was just a general -- general assault statute. You don't know it was committed in the home or not. Whereas if you're -- if you're convicted of the crime, the misdemeanor of violence against a spouse or a relative like this, you know exactly what the - - what the crime is?",
  "I understand that -- that when someone purchases a firearm, they have to affirm, check a box, I have been convicted of a crime of domestic violence. Is that how it reads? And that goes to, you know, to the Federal Government and they check the records of convictions. How -- how would your client check that? I have been -- I have been convicted of a crime of domestic violence, if he had been convicted of assault and the assault happened to be domestic assault would - - would he be perjuring himself if he said no?",
  "Does -- does it make clear whether the offense has to be domestic -- a domestic violence offense or whether an ordinary assault offense will qualify if as a matter of fact it was domestic?",
  "I don't understand what you've said.",
  "Oh, and it's drafted the way the statute should have been drafted. Isn't that interesting. In other words, it breaks out the \"was committed by a current or former spouse\" and makes that a separate provision, rather than a part of the element \"use of attempted force against a family member.\"",
  "Well, sure it would. Just as an \"is\" - -",
  "I mean, if you want to add words you can add \"if,\" you can add \"as is,\" you could rewrite the statute a lot of ways.",
  "Excuse me. Under anybody's view, it made it narrow. Under Lautenberg's view, it made it narrow.",
  "How did it make it broader? I mean, it used to cover cutting -- cutting a credit card. Now, it no longer does.",
  "Of course it does.",
  "You have to add words. It is unavoidable. To come to your reading, you must add words to the statute. To adopt the reading of the other side on the other hand, you need not add a single word. You just have to resign yourself to the -- to the usage that is unusual but not unheard of, that a particular use was committed. And the other side gives a number of examples, as does the brief by -- by linguists, a number of examples where that appears. So it's an unusual usage but not an unheard of usage. They don't have to add a single word or a single hard break in the text. You have to, to get to your construction.",
  "You'd would have to put a \"that\" - -",
  "You'd have to put a \"that\" at the beginning of (ii) as well, wouldn't you?",
  "It makes it easier to identify it. You don't have to go back and look to see whether this particular assault conviction was an assault on a family member or not. It's there on the face of the indictment. Pretty important, it seems to me.",
  "Why wouldn't he have brought that new evidence to the attention of the State court first? Why wasn't he obliged to bring it to the attention of the State court?",
  "Well, he could have a post-conviction proceeding in the State court.",
  "A State habeas.",
  "Mr. Bress, this case involves Section 2254(d), right? Does that appear somewhere in the briefs? It would be nice to have it in front of me.",
  "I mean, it's a central thing the case is about. I cannot find it in any of the briefs. Appendix to the petition for cert; I got -- I got to go back to that. Don't you think it's important enough to be in your brief?",
  "How do you want us to dispose of the case that doesn't, that doesn't do that? What do you want us to do?",
  "That's it?",
  "Why shouldn't the district judge in light of the new evidence decide whether the judgment of the State court was -- would have been reasonable if it came out the same way, including this new evidence in the -- in the consideration? Why shouldn't he do it that way.",
  "I know it could. But I'm asking whether it should.",
  "Well, it seems to me the statute certainly contemplates that the States have the first - -",
  "-- the first cut at this thing, right? How else do you give them the first cut?",
  "So the Federal court is supposed to do what?",
  "Okay.",
  "Having established cause, he would then in your view not have the Federal court decide the matter de novo. But the only question before the Federal court was whether there was in addition prejudice.",
  "That is to say, whether - - but for the error, any reasonable factfinder would find by clear and convincing evidence that he was innocent - -",
  "-- right?",
  "I guess the State court can say, you know, 60 days after the trial is -- is doomsday. No more new evidence. We are not going to consider anything new after that, even if you find Brady stuff or anything else. Suppose that's unconstitutional -- but it isn't. I mean, is that unconstitutional?",
  "Right. So if it's not unconstitutional, then you just provide what you say, that the district court sees whether by clear and convincing evidence the case would have come out the other way. If it were unconstitutional, and I guess this is what is sticking in our craw -- my craw, anyway -- if it were unconstitutional, it seems to me there ought to be a way to make the State take the first cut at it. Make the State say oh, yes, even with this new evidence we would still find this person guilty; and then in Federal habeas you would -- you would apply the deference that 2254(d) requires. You'd ask whether that was a reasonable determination.",
  "That's the fallacy in my - - in my reasoning. Or you're saying I shouldn't be troubled by what has been troubling me, namely that he had no way to get this before the State court. They are entitled to close -- close the gates?",
  "Well, you know, it does read -- 2254(e) -- it does read, \"a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\" That sounds like exactly what you're describing, the discovery of DNA evidence you didn't know about.",
  "Mr. Bress, I want to apologize to you for accusing you of not printing 2254(d) and (e) in your brief. You indeed did.",
  "I'm grateful for your not throwing it in my teeth.",
  "I suppose it depends on what the Government speech consists of, what it is the Government is saying about the Ten Commandments. If the Government is saying the Ten Commandments are the word of God that's one thing, and if the Government is saying the Ten Commandments are an important part of our national heritage, that's something else.",
  "I think 38 is the cut-off point.",
  "Is this a challenge to the Ten Commandments monument?",
  "I thought this case did not involve an Establishment Clause challenge. Why are we --",
  "It goes to the same thing, doesn't it? I mean, whether it's the Government stating the message or whether it's the Government creating a limited public forum for the presentation of only those messages that it thinks are important, it comes to the same thing, doesn't it?",
  "It seems to me the Government could disfavor homosexuality just as it could disfavor abortion, just as it can disfavor a number of other things that in -- in many States people are free to do. The Government can disfavor all of it, can't it?",
  "It's not only absolutely entitled, it has to do so. It -- it has no choice, does it?",
  "You can't run a museum if you have to accept everything, right?",
  "Well, maybe they can't do it in museums, either. I mean, yes, we've been doing this for a couple of hundred years, but maybe we've been wrong all along and maybe the Government can't run museums. It's possible, right? It's a brave new world.",
  "You say in a public forum. I mean, that sort of begs the question. I mean, that - - that encapulates your -- your -- encapsulates your answer. Has the -- has the city allowed anybody to put up a monument there willy-nilly? I mean, a public forum, as you know, we can have praise in the park, we can have protest. Anybody can do it, so long as you get a license and you're not interfering with some other group. That's a public forum. Has this city said anybody can put up a monument in this park?",
  "It's a public forum for some things. Is it a public forum for everything? It may be a public forum for processions, for parades. But it is a public -- is it a public forum for anybody constructing a monument?",
  "The other side says that some of these monuments, especially in the Civil War battlegrounds, do indeed show who the donors are.",
  "What -- Mr. Sekulow says that some of these monuments, notably those in the Civil War battlefields, do show who the donors are. Now is that Government speech or private speech?",
  "So they have to go?",
  "Now that the Government converted them, it passes a law saying, what, we -- we adopt this?",
  "Isn't it enough that the Government accepts ownership of it and places it on the Government's property? Isn't that a manifestation of the Government's adoption of it?",
  "It depends on what you mean by adopting one version. If it's adopting the version by saying these Ten Commandments are the word of God, that's one thing. If it's adopting it by just saying this is a version of the Ten Commandments that has had a very significant place in the history of the American people.",
  "I wouldn't care what version it was if that's all they're doing.",
  "Nor would the Mormons in Utah, I think.",
  "Ms. Harris, we -- we need a clear rule here. We -- we can't expect the courts or the cities for that matter to investigate in every case what the degree of the Government's involvement in the -- and what is the degree, 50 percent, 45 percent, 36 years? I mean, we are going to make up a percentage? That's -- that's not the way threshold constitutional questions ought to be resolved or resolvable. We need a clear rule that the cities can rely on.",
  "Is there an historical basis for that, or you just made it up? You think it would be a good idea? I mean, if that had been the practice over the past 200 years for all of these monuments that -- that, you know, are strewed across the landscape, then I'd say yes, that's probably what the difference is. But I'm not aware that there is any such - - such requirement and any such practice on the part of Government. You're -- you're creating a new world.",
  "It may be a very nice world but it happens not to be the world under which our Constitution has subjected this country.",
  "So that's all right, the first 95 monuments, whoever -- whoever put them up, okay? It's a monument to chocolate chip cookies or whatever else, is that it? First 95?",
  "This is a practical solution to the problem?",
  "You will say just the opposite when you come back here to challenge the Ten Commandments monument on -- on Establishment Clause grounds. You will say something like this: Anybody who comes into this park and seeing this monument owned by the Government, on Government land, will think that the Government is endorsing this message. That's what you will say now.",
  "Now why would it be true there, but it's not true here? Would anybody think that on public land owned by the Government the Government disagrees with this message?",
  "Suppose the resolution of adoption by the City Council just says, \"The City Council agrees that this monument of the Eagle Association expresses an idea worthy of the public's attention.\"",
  "Is that enough?",
  "What if it's just a statue of George Washington? What kind of a resolution does the city council adopt? \"We endorse everything George Washington ever said\"?",
  "Well, if - -",
  "That's right, and I think they would adopt a resolution that says, \"We think George Washington is worthy of respect and emulation on the part of our citizens.\"",
  "If it could say that, why couldn't it say the same thing about the Ten Commandments? \"We think the Ten Commandments are worthy of respect and\" -- and I wouldn't say \"emulation\"; I would say \"respect and reverence by our citizens.\"",
  "Would that be enough?",
  "I don't know what that means.",
  "It has acquired the memorial. The City has acquired property in this memorial and has agreed for this memorial to be placed in the city park. Period. \"We believe that the Ten Commandments which are embodied in this memorial are worthy of respect by the citizens of Pleasant Grove\" - - is that enough?",
  "I don't know what that means. You keep saying it, and I don't know what it means.",
  "I would have thought adopting what I said shows that it is adopting the content of the monument insofar as the monument says the Ten Commandments should be respected by the citizens of Pleasant Grove. Is that enough?",
  "Or it has to say, \"We believe in the Ten Commandments\"?",
  "You don't think that's fairly implied by the mere fact that it is there in Pleasant Grove's park and that Pleasant Grove City Council has allowed it to be constructed there? Don't you think that's implicit?",
  "Maybe the City doesn't know - -",
  "-- know what you mean by \"We adopt,\" just as I don't know what you mean by \"We adopt.\"",
  "Is this included in the question presented anyway?",
  "Does it have anything to do with the way the Second Circuit resolved this case?",
  "The Second Circuit simply said you could not deprive an individual of the right to a court trial.",
  "And the issue is whether - - now, if -- if we held that you can require the individual to go to arbitration, in some later case we could confront the question of whether, if the union is in exclusive control of the arbitration and the -- the individual will -- will not get a fair arbitrated deal, that would invalidate it. But it has nothing to do with the question presented: Is an arbitration clause which clearly and unmistakably waives the union member's right to a judicial forum enforceable.",
  "I -- I hate to get into this, you know, 9 years history of dealings between the union and -- and the employees.",
  "What does that mean? Does that mean that they must go to arbitration even if the union decides that, you know, this claim is -- is so insignificant we don't want to take it to arbitration?",
  "Mr. Salvatore, I -- I didn't think we took this case to -- to determine the specific meaning as to this issue of this -- of this particular contract, which is not an issue of national importance. Why -- why must we decide the case here? Could we not simply decide that the Second Circuit was either correct, in which case the case would be over, or incorrect to say that you -- that you -- you cannot -- you cannot in a collective bargaining agreement have the union responsible for arbitration of Title VII claims? Why couldn't we just decide that? And then if there is any issue of whether such concession to the union deprives an individual of even the right to arbitration, that can -- that can be decided on remand by the Second Circuit, couldn't it?",
  "And the Second Circuit could look into all of these details.",
  "And inquire into the New York law that you're talking about now and that I don't recall being in any of the briefing.",
  "Mr. Salvatore, would you - - would you object to or oppose a ruling that said -- that says yes, the -- the right can be subjected to union arbitration, but if the union chooses not to arbitrate it the individual must have the right to arbitrate it on his own?",
  "He has got an arbitration instead of a lawsuit.",
  "Why has it? Why has it? I mean, let's assume that my gripe with my employer is that he hasn't paid me my salary for the last two months. Now, you can't take away my right to that unless I voluntarily waived it. What is sacrosanct about the fact that my grievance here has some discrimination attached to it? Your briefing talks as though it is something totally apart from a mere economic right. Ninety-nine percent of the time, you're talking about economics. \"I was fired because of discrimination.\" \"I wasn't promoted because of discrimination and therefore I lost this -- this amount of money or that amount of money.\" Why is it unthinkable that the -- that the employee would have to go through the union-prescribed arbitration for the fact that he wasn't paid for the last three months but does not have to do it for an economic injury that occurs because of discrimination?",
  "You did raise that issue, but you didn't say that the consequence of that issue was that you win. You said the consequence of the fact that that issue was involved in this case was a good reason not to -- for us to accept cert. And we didn't take your advice on that.",
  "But it's a totally different issue whether because of that question you - - you should -- you should win the case.",
  "It doesn't have to be within the question presented. You -- you can sustain the judgment below on any ground.",
  "The only question is whether we will -- we will agree that we should inquire into new ground. That's all.",
  "Why -- why doesn't this come within that?",
  "Why don't many of these cases, if not most of them, come within that? The union negotiates the salaries for various levels, and then the person says: I should be at this level. The only reason I didn't get it was that I was discriminated against.",
  "You -- you call it a non-economic theory. Phooey, it's an economic case.",
  "It is not taking away the right. The -- the union is not taking away the right. It's just saying to vindicate it, you have to go to arbitration instead of to the courts.",
  "Article 7, no.",
  "You said Article 6. Isn't it Article 7, if it's on 47a?",
  "Oh, I see. Okay, so you are on 6. I got you.",
  "Where does that appear?",
  "Where does that appear?",
  "We should have the discretion. Why do you keep talking about the Special Master? He's just -- he's just our amanuensis. Ultimately it's our discretion, isn't it?",
  "Well, I assume -- I assume your answer is that it's -- that it's our business, and we don't have to agree with Congress; that we -- we may think $40 a day for the zookeeper and for Albert Einstein is ridiculous. And, therefore, if it's up to us, we would adopt a different rule. Isn't that your answer?",
  "Could you save that for the lower courts? I mean, you are -- you are trying to distinguish what it can say for the Supreme Court when the Supreme Court is the trial court vis-a-vis what it can say, and has said, for the lower courts.",
  "Why?",
  "You think that, so long as Congress could not create the lower courts at all, once it creates them it can -- it can tie their hands to any sort of absurd rules?",
  "I -- I just don't agree with your assumption that just because Congress need not have created any lower Federal courts, the only Federal court required by the Constitution is this Court, therefore once Congress creates them, it can do whatever it wants with them. I -- I don't agree with that.",
  "What is magical about original actions? I mean, what -- what is magical is that we are the only court that is required by the Constitution. But we are -- we are not just the only court for original actions in -- in -- in all appeals. Can Congress prescribe division of costs and expenses in the appeals that come to us from the lower Federal courts?",
  "It's not a matter of unfairness to Einstein anyway. I mean, you know, the expert witness is going to get his money.",
  "The question is - -",
  "The question is whether one side can get some money from the other to help pay for it. Do you happen to know whether at the time the original jurisdiction of this Court was established, there was such a thing as the charging of expert witness fees?",
  "I don't either.",
  "The Constitution says that no money shall be -- shall be withdrawn from the Treasury except by appropriations made by law. I think -- I think you need a law to spend -- to spend the government's money.",
  "Could I ask you what - - what are the fees to be charged by its clerk, referred to in 1911. \"Supreme Court may fix the fees to be charged by its clerk,\" and then the next paragraph says the fees of the clerk. Is that what the first paragraph refers to, the fees of the clerk? Or does it mean other fees that the clerk charges which could include costs? Are the costs part of the fees to be charged by the clerk?",
  "They are not? Fees of the clerk -- in 1920 says fees of the clerk in Marshall, but that could be taxed as costs. Right? A judge or clerk can tax as costs the following. 1911 says Supreme Court may fix \"the fees to be charged by its clerk,\" and you say that doesn't include costs. Boy, it's a messy, messy bunch of statutes, don't you think?",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, that's some comfort.",
  "Yes, but that taxes costs, and it doesn't say the Supreme Court may fix costs. May fix the fees to be charged by its clerk, which you say don't include costs.",
  "So that wouldn't allow to us fix that.",
  "Well, it tells you how they are to be taxed. It doesn't say what their level is to be. May be taxed against the litigants as the court directs, but I don't see any authority to fix them - - fix the amounts. It's not a very good statute, really.",
  "Maybe lawyers get even more.",
  "And you don't get that back either.",
  "What if Congress -- really you think Congress could set any -- there's not some point at which it is so destructive of the process here? What if Congress provides that the winning -- that the winning party shall pay the costs of the losing party? Can Congress do that?",
  "Maybe the question ought to be whether this Court intended to have the Title IX action which it invented preclude 1983. Why don't we look to the intent of this Court?",
  "Mr. Rothfeld, we were -- we were warned about all these problems in the brief in opposition, weren't we?",
  "Didn't that focus almost entirely upon the fact that there is no 1983 cause of action anyway?",
  "And we nonetheless granted -- granted cert?",
  "Yet the other side says that there may be, and I don't know why we ought to get into that. Why can't we just send it back and let them figure that out? And -- and -- and decide what we took this case to decide, namely, the split that now exists in the Federal courts over whether Title IX precludes the use of 1983. That is an important question. It's why we took the case. Why can't we decide that issue and then for all these loose ends, send it back to the court of appeals?",
  "He says there is an issue in controversy, that's good enough for me.",
  "That -- but that doesn't cover the situation in which a plaintiff says, I don't want to proceed under Title IX; I want to proceed first under 1983. Then there is going to be no question about whether 1983 is -- is unavailable because of issue preclusion. He is starting with 1983.",
  "What is your position on that - -",
  "You can't proceed under 1983.",
  "So you are disagreeing.",
  "Well, does that provision apply only when there is a Title IX cause of action?",
  "Oh well, if it doesn't, then it -- then it has validity whether or not you agree with your position.",
  "They thought only in cases where there is no Title IX action.",
  "Oh, you don't think they mean whether there is a valid claim? Even when there is a claim that isn't allowed under the law?",
  "\"Reduce\" in any event is - - is not -- is not the same as what you are arguing. You are arguing reduce to the maximum extent reasonably possible. The word \"reduce\" alone doesn't convey that. The word \"reduce\" would just mean, you know, if you - - if you knock it down any amount, you have reduced it. But you are saying \"minimize\" requires more than that. It means reducing it to the maximum extent reasonably possible. Isn't that what you are saying?",
  "Just to reduce.",
  "I didn't understand that to be your position. You -- you don't think that \"minimize\" even means that you reduce it to the maximum extent reasonably possible?",
  "You think any reduction constitutes minimizing?",
  "Yes.",
  "Let me say it again and you tell me whether you agree. I had thought that what you meant the meaning of \"minimize\" was is that you reduce the -- the harm to the maximum extent reasonably possible, not merely that you reduce it to some extent.",
  "Of course, \"reasonable\" includes everything.",
  "Ms. Mahoney, I -- before you go any further. I am not clear. I -- I did not understand that for 30 years the only test has been a grossly disproportionate test. You seem to accept that as true.",
  "Wholly disproportionate?",
  "And you're -- you're happy with that?",
  "Okay. You think they can use a wholly disproportionate?",
  "And you'd be happy if they continued to do that, but you wouldn't be particularly happy if we prescribed that as the only available test? Is that the - -",
  "Except -- except, you say, when it's grossly disproportionate?",
  "Where -- where -- where do you find that? Or the Second Circuit said, anyway.",
  "You are using the word in a strange -- economically available? Economically feasible maybe. But you wouldn't say economically available. You wouldn't say I can't buy the house because for me it's not economically available. I might say it's not economically feasible, it's not economically possible, but it's not economically available? That's weird.",
  "I disagree with that.",
  "But that -- but that -- but that doesn't answer, it seems to me, the question. Yes, the best available for that purpose, but what is best for that purpose could include other factors such as how expensive is it and -- and how much it harms the industry and all sorts of things.",
  "Why? Why does it? I don't know how you draw the lines you are drawing. You say yes, \"best\" includes whether it would bankrupt the industry. Well, if it includes whether it would bankrupt the industry, why shouldn't it include whether it would bankrupt the individual power company?",
  "I -- I agree with you on that, whether it's borne by the industry. But you draw the line there.",
  "Why isn't it where that line is drawn up to the agency?",
  "Okay.",
  "I assume you can't get a variance and you also would say the EPA cannot take it into account if this particular plant -- although the company as a whole is quite prosperous, this is a small plant, and it's not generating that much electricity. It's really just not worth it to put in this big tower. We are going to close down.",
  "That would not be something that EPA could take into account.",
  "Well, it has -- it has required, not just permitted but required cost-benefit analysis in other areas. What - -",
  "What -- what is your response to the fact that it -- it seems ridiculous to allow it, and indeed require it in effluent situations where human health is at stake, and yet to forbid it in this intake situation when you were just talking about the snail darter. What -- what's your response to that?",
  "And did that section 307 not allow cost-benefit?",
  "He can still get that in Federal court, can't he?",
  "But it's okay for the State to say, we don't want any tort actions in our courts? That would be all right?",
  "That's strange. Why -- but it can't do the lesser thing of saying, we don't want this particular type of tort action. One is jurisdictional -- you would say it's jurisdictional, right? And this one is not jurisdictional, just because it's narrower? It's still directed to the type of action.",
  "But -- but not if New York said, we don't want any tort actions. What about if New York says, we don't want any -- uh -- personal injury tort actions? Would that be enough, or is that too narrow? And I'm going to narrow it down after that until I get down to your case.",
  "I understand that. I just don't understand -- you acknowledge it's okay if it's jurisdictional; and you acknowledge that it is jurisdictional if you don't allow any tort actions. I just don't know what makes this to be non-jurisdictional. I don't know.",
  "No, we would discuss what is analogous.",
  "But you have acknowledged that it would be okay and would be a jurisdictional rule if the court -- if the State courts did not entertain tort actions. That's a rule that goes to the substance of the claim, isn't it?",
  "Yes, it's picking and choosing tort claims.",
  "Yes.",
  "They're -- they are liable in Federal court.",
  "They're certainly not immune in Federal court.",
  "General Underwood, your friend on the other side acknowledges that if New York states closed its courts to tort actions, that would be okay. But I don't see how closing your courts to tort actions has any administrative -- particular administrative rationale behind it, do you?",
  "He's still responsible, right? I mean - -",
  "He's still responsible.",
  "Even if it were, it would be discriminatory and invalid, right?",
  "Or discriminatory. It's picking on - -",
  "Even if it were, it would be discriminatory and invalid, right?",
  "Or discriminatory.",
  "That -- that's an important factor, I would think. Let me ask another question. It -- it's a standard rule of international law that no State will enforce the penal laws of another State. I assume the Federal Government could not -- maybe I am wrong to assert this, but could the Federal Government require New York to prosecute federal crimes?",
  "I don't, either, but I think it can't. I think it can't, probably. Then my next question is going to be: Why aren't punitive damages penal laws as well? And if that's the same principle, maybe there's no big deal about New York excluding penal damages - -",
  "I find it hard to regard this as a non-neutral law when it was put on the books before there were any of these 1983 actions.",
  "Excuse me. What -- what issue was debated here four times?",
  "Did our opinion decide that -- that question? Did our opinion say that that question was decided against your opponent?",
  "Why didn't the trial judge just stop there? I mean, if this is the ruling in the State - -",
  "-- once the trial judge found that one of the other instructions was bad, he could have just said, I throw the whole thing out. Why did he go to all the trouble of going into this, the governing one?",
  "You -- you are acknowledging that the trial court did not apply the rule - -",
  "Mr. Peck, are you -- are you asserting that our remand order was in error? After all, it did say, \"We remand this case so that the Oregon Supreme Court can apply this standard we have set forth.\"",
  "If you say it's in error, my next question is going to be - -",
  "-- can -- is it up to a State court to sit in judgment about whether our remand orders are in error or not?",
  "If that's what they took it to mean, they were just wrong. I mean, that's not what it says.",
  "The opinion concludes, \"As the preceding discussion makes clear, we believe the Oregon Supreme Court applied the wrong constitutional standard when considering Philip Morris's appeal.\" And it goes to the constitutional issue we are talking about.",
  "\"We remand so that the Oregon Supreme Court can apply the standard we have set forth,\" which has nothing to do with the issue we have been discussing this morning.",
  "So it was wrong?",
  "That's very nice, but that's not what we remanded for.",
  "Why do you say that? That it was understood so? Because of the Attorney General's commentary on that?",
  "Excuse me. Why is that? I'm not sure I follow you on that point. Once he's got up to the next level and finds what the notice should have told him, why can't he come up with it then?",
  "You say it's a de novo, right, at this next level?",
  "Would that lie here first? I mean, you don't -- you don't think -- you don't think that the regulatory agency would be acting properly if it prescribed a price that was predatory or allowed the charge of a price that was predatory, would you?",
  "They wouldn't permit it. Then is there -- is there no such thing as primary agency responsibility to take care of that problem rather than rushing into a court and take care of it through the -- through the Sherman Act?",
  "Well, they are dealing with the problem there. They are decreeing the price that could be charged, aren't they? Don't they have to approve the pricing?",
  "How -- how long has this case been going on? When -- when was -- when was the crime?",
  "The crime was committed in 1980, 28 years ago.",
  "And when was the -- when was the conviction and the sentence of death pronounced?",
  "And you want to go back down again, for another - -",
  "How old is this -- is this defendant?",
  "How many claims were -- was this a case where there, what, 81 separate claim counts?",
  "I mean, I can understand giving a lick and a promise to -- to each one if you come up with 81.",
  "52. Close enough. I'll say the same for 52.",
  "Well, you know, I'll give you the first, that he appeared drunk or high. That's pretty clear, but I think you tend to look wild-eyed after you're running out after a jewelry store robbery, and I think you're -- you're certainly inclined to look \"agitated\" and \"looking about in a frenzied manner\" when you've just committed two brutal murders. I don't think that's evidence of drug addiction at all, of being under the influence of drugs.",
  "He was conceded that he was a drug user.",
  "And that he was dangerous because he admitted the murders.",
  "Do -- do you agree the prosecutor was arguing, when he said that he's a drug dealer, that he was not a drug user? Was it -- was it conceded that he was a drug user? I suspect it was not. I said earlier it was, and it seems that it was not, because he introduced one witness to say that there were no -- no needle marks on his body, which would suggest that he's trying to make the point to the jury that this person doesn't even use drugs.",
  "What was the photographic evidence?",
  "Of course, for a Terry - - for a Terry pat down you don't need, do you, articulable suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous? So long as you have a suspicion of unlawful activity, you can stop the individual and pat down. Do you have to have, in addition to stopping the individual, an articulable suspicion that he is armed and dangerous?",
  "Both armed and dangerous?",
  "Well, but I -- I thought you said that there has to be an articulable suspicion that he is armed and dangerous.",
  "A bulge would not be enough to conduct a pat down after a Terry stop, therefore.",
  "Well, then why should it be enough to -- to justify a pat down here?",
  "No, I understand. I weigh all the factors, and there's nothing but a bulge.",
  "Okay. So the bulge alone -- Well, whether I believe? There has to be, you know, a reasonable basis for - -",
  "-- an articulable basis for the belief, right?",
  "So I don't see why a bulge alone would -- would satisfy.",
  "We have a whole separate line of cases apart from the Terry stop cases which allow officers to protect themselves by conducting a search of the surrounding area when they arrest somebody. And that justifies a pat down of the person that they arrest also, doesn't it?",
  "Whether or not they think that -- that he's about to -- to draw the gun and shoot them.",
  "Why wouldn't that line of cases be extendible to this kind of a situation?",
  "Why -- why during a traffic stop shouldn't they be able to ensure their own safety by -- by patting down the people who have been stopped, whether or not they have an articulable suspicion that they are about to draw and shoot? But that's not what you're proposing, is it?",
  "Yes.",
  "Why -- why go the Terry route instead of the route that -- that covers search of the area around the person who is arrested?",
  "Why -- why had this descended from a -- a seizure to a post-seizure consensual encounter? Why was the seizure over?",
  "Well, it seems to me you're -- you're acknowledging that she said that it was a purely -- you're not arguing it as based on a purely consensual encounter? I thought that that's what you - -",
  "Even though she said so?",
  "Okay.",
  "Mr. Pincus, I want to go back to the previous subject for a minute. We certainly didn't take this case to decide whether the passenger was free to leave or not. That -- that was not the issue on which we took the case. And you claim that that issue has already been resolved by findings of the lower courts?",
  "In order to contradict that, would we have to find that that's clearly erroneous?",
  "I guess what about -- I -- I guess if we held that you could do this, this pat-down search here, it would probably carry forward to any other kind of seizure like a -- a roadblock to inspect for drunken driving or anything like that?",
  "We would say the same thing: That if there is a passenger in that car, you could tell the passenger to get out and conduct a pat-down search.",
  "Not so fast.",
  "The \"armed and dangerous\" requirement, does the \"dangerous\" requirement mean endangering the policeman, or is it enough -- is it enough if -- if you think this fellow is -- you know, he's just a dangerous character. Is that enough, or does it have to be an immediate threat to the policeman?",
  "What do you think?",
  "It's -- it's not enough if you think he's -- he's Al Capone?",
  "What do you -- what do you say about the other -- the other side's point that in the case of a Terry stop there's a -- a mutually enforcing -- reinforcing aspect? You have a suspicion that -- there is crime afoot to begin with, plus the -- the suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous; whereas, here, you know, it's a traffic stop is all.",
  "So what -- what is required where you think criminal activity is afoot is not necessarily going to be the same as what's required when you -- when there's just a traffic stop.",
  "Well, you -- you could have said the same thing about the existence of a conspiracy in -- in the antitrust case. I mean, that was the argument. How can we prove an agreement until we have discovery?",
  "We say you need something more in order to go forward, something more than, you know, you prevented these people from talking to Johnny Cochran. That's not going to do it.",
  "Well, there are two possibilities here. Number one is the possibility that there was a general policy adopted by the high-level officials which was perfectly valid and that whatever distortions you are complaining about was in the implementation by lower level officials. That's one possibility. The other possibility, which seems to me much less plausible, is that the -- the high-level officials themselves directed these -- these unconstitutional and unlawful acts.",
  "Well, I mean, that's lovely, that -- that the -- the ability of the Attorney General and Director of the FBI to -- to do their jobs without having to litigate personal liability is dependent upon the discretionary decision of a single district judge. I mean, I thought that the protection of qualified immunity gave them -- gave them more than that.",
  "It doesn't give them much, if that's all it gives them.",
  "But they pleaded a conspiracy -- they pleaded a conspiracy in Bell Atlantic. It wasn't a matter of not -- not setting forth in the complaint the substance of what produced liability. They pleaded conspiracy.",
  "When?",
  "Does it say when? Does it say what basis?",
  "I don't know on what basis any of these allegations against the high-level officials are made.",
  "Well, we'll -- we'll check that.",
  "The Solicitor General contests that.",
  "Is -- is no penological interest enough?",
  "I mean, is that the only basis -- after an attack on the country of the magnitude of 9/11, is that the only basis on which people could be held? Namely that these people are the -- are the guilty culprits, and we are going to put them in jail?",
  "Surely for at least a period, you can hold people just -- just to investigate?",
  "Well, it wasn't solely on that.",
  "But the net was surely not cast wide enough if anybody with that race, religion was -- was swept in.",
  "I mean, if it's solely for that reason, there would have been hundreds of thousands of others.",
  "-- implausible.",
  "If you are right, you win assuming you get a district judge who is also right.",
  "Yes, but I thought the question was whether it was unlawful at the time, before the later statute.",
  "And -- and you say that, even though discriminating against pregnancy leave was itself lawful, a retirement plan that did not give you credit for the time of that pregnancy leave was unlawful?",
  "And you say Gilbert had nothing to do with it?",
  "Go on, finish. I --",
  "I don't understand why you say that the retirement plan is facially discriminatory now. You contend that right now it's facially discriminatory.",
  "It seems to me what the retirement plan says is that there is deducted from your seniority, for purposes of calculating what you get under the plan, all periods in which you -- you were lawfully not deemed to be -- to be working for the company. Now, that doesn't seem to be facially discriminatory at all.",
  "No, but it didn't. Not -- not during the period for which it is used in -- in the retirement system.",
  "After the new legislation was passed, yes, pregnancy leave counts for seniority. But -- but during the period before that occurred, it was not counted towards seniority, and it -- and it was lawfully not counted towards seniority. So what you have is a retirement plan that says all lawful periods of work -- all periods of work are -- that lawfully must be credited will be credited to the -- to the employees. I don't see how that is facially discriminatory.",
  "Is -- is there a difference between \"facially discriminatory\" and \"discriminatory impact\"? I mean I can see how you could say it has a discriminatory impact, but to say that on its face, when all it says is that you are credited with all of the periods in which you were lawfully working for the company and you are not credited for periods in which the company lawfully deemed you not to be working for the company, I don't see how that is facially discriminatory in -- in any sense.",
  "Did it say it was facially discriminatory? I'm -- I'm just talking about your -- your assertion that it's facially discriminatory. Did Basemore more say it was facially discriminatory?",
  "What -- what do you do about section 703(h) of Title VII, which -- which we have held says that -- that makes it lawful for a bona fide seniority system to perpetuate the effects of pre-Act discrimination?",
  "That hinges -- that hinges on your \"facially discriminatory.\"",
  "Well, yes, that's -- that's rather implausible, but 70(h) covers sex discrimination and even race discrimination, but it doesn't cover pregnancy discrimination. I mean, I --",
  "You need pretty clear language to persuade me of that.",
  "You mean there are a lot more suits coming behind this one --",
  "-- for any kind of discrimination that preceded Title VII? When was Title VII enacted?",
  "There may be still some of those people around.",
  "I mean, you're scaring me.",
  "Why not? Why not?",
  "That would be a subsequent -- a subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings, his retrial in state courts.",
  "Excuse me. I have lost you. Where is the \"appropriate\"? I don't see any \"appropriate.\"",
  "It says \"shall represent the defendant throughout every subsequent\" -- every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings.",
  "Yes, right.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, it says \"and all\" - -",
  "Right.",
  "\"Other appropriate,\" but as far as what's covered by the first clause is concerned, \"appropriate\" doesn't apply to that.",
  "\"Represent throughout every subsequent stage of available proceedings, including pretrial, trial, sentencing, motions for a new trial, appeals, applications for writ of certiorari. There is no \"appropriate\" in any of that.",
  "\"And shall also represent\" -- and \"other appropriate motions and procedures,\" but that doesn't cover the earlier stuff.",
  "Well, but -- but, you know, it mentions trial proceedings, trial, motion for a new trial, appeals, applications for writ of certiorari. And then, in the next clause it just says \"and all available post-conviction process.\" Now, you would acknowledge that going back to exhaust claims that had not been exhausted before the State courts would be post-conviction process or not?",
  "\"Subsequent stage\" does not apply to this clause. I'm reading the clause \"and all available post- conviction process.\"",
  "Okay.",
  "Right.",
  "Ms. Chavis, what do you do about(a)(1)? That also is not limited by its terms - -",
  "-- to federal prisoners. Would you argue that it says \"in every criminal action, which defendant is charged with a crime that is punishable by death.\"",
  "So even in the original State trial, he is entitled to a federal defendant; is that right?",
  "Why not? It doesn't limit it to Federal trials.",
  "Right. It says he \"shall be entitled to the appointment of one or more attorneys.\"",
  "So what? I mean, it still is -- is unqualified.",
  "And part of your argument, not your only argument but a large part of your argument, is since it is unqualified in (E), the last clause, it has to include State. Well, you could say the same about (a)(1).",
  "Oh, but -- but - -",
  "So -- so if the State doesn't provide counsel, the Federal Government will provide it, and the States can recede from their obligation to provide counsel, right.",
  "Why? Why? So long as he has counsel, we don't care who pays for it.",
  "What -- what about expert services? I think most States don't provide for that.",
  "The Federal Government will provide expert -- compensation for the use of experts when the States won't?",
  "Under (a)(1)?",
  "Sure.",
  "It seems -- it seems to me, counsel, that the mere fact that it doesn't mention \"federal\" explicitly is -- is not a very strong argument unless you are going to take the position that even (a)(1) applies to federal and state. And -- and really what you are -- the only strong strength to your bow is that it says \"executive or other clemency.\" And -- and there -- there seems to be no federal clemency except executive clemency, I guess. I guess. Can Congress declare something that has been a crime no longer a crime and set the guy loose? I don't know. Is that \"clemency\"?",
  "It says here the President can. It doesn't say Congress can't. Does it say Congress can't?",
  "And we know that they read this text carefully before they voted for it, right?",
  "We don't know any of that.",
  "These are all assumptions. That's all.",
  "I thought this was a Federal law. Is this a Conyers law; is that what it is here?",
  "Did his colleagues know what he said?",
  "Should the Constitution be amended it would cover that, right?",
  "Mr. Jay, I assume that (a)(1), which provides for the appointment of counsel to conduct the trial in a capital case, would not have very much application either, would it?",
  "Only in federal capital cases, of which there are very, very few.",
  "Surely, you could. You could put all I don't remember weight on the other executive or other -- and you could say that's the only provision where it's apparently clear from the text that State proceedings were included. Assuming you are wrong, that there are non-executive State clemency proceedings, you are sure that there aren't?",
  "Excuse me, what do you mean by the federal-State balance? Because this is funding somebody to argue against the interests of the State, isn't it?",
  "I mean, assuming the state has convicted somebody, you are arguing against the State.",
  "And the federal government is funding that.",
  "And that's the government's position, under this provision, even if -- even if State funding -- well, as you say State isn't covered anyway.",
  "Assuming State funding is covered, assuming representation in the State is covered, it does seem to be the case that the test of whether you get some Federal lawyer appointed is not whether you don't have a State lawyer, but rather whether you can pay for counsel, right?",
  "Can pay.",
  "That's strange.",
  "Fill material trumps effluent, in other words?",
  "But it can contain it so long as it is -- as it -- as it is not transitory.",
  "I mean, isn't it arguable that the best place for -- for really toxic stuff is at the bottom of a lake so long as it stays there and is not carried - -",
  "Is nontoxic covered by 402?",
  "Nontoxic is covered by 402. You -- you can violate the effluent guidelines by -- by pouring into the waters of the United States even nontoxic materials, isn't that right?",
  "And under 404 it'S only toxic.",
  "And that's the big difference.",
  "If EPA were to amend the performance standard to say that it doesn't apply in the situation in which the fill rule applies, would that be a valid regulation?",
  "Could the -- could the EPA allow a point source to discharge sand slurry -- there's nothing in it but sand -- into a river? Wouldn't you have to -- wouldn't you need some permission from the EPA to do that? Wouldn't that violate the Act?",
  "I want to discharge. I have a pipe and there is sand on my land which is being washed away. I'm discharging all that sand into a river.",
  "Would that violate - -",
  "Discharge of a pollutant.",
  "Now, if I do the same thing in a lake, because I want to fill the lake, of what possible application is the fill standard unless it permits what would otherwise be prohibited under - - under the earlier sections?",
  "Even though it violates effluent standards.",
  "But you say -- you say that if you discharge sand into -- into a river it violates effluent standards.",
  "Yes, but -- but do you have a -- a case over these 40 years where a company was trying to use the emission from the mine as a fill material in a lake rather than in a settling pond, and where the EPA, despite the fact that it was using it to fill a lake, applied its effluent standards?",
  "Well, then - -",
  "Evidently not. I mean, the EPA says not. Do you have a -- an instance where it was prohibited where a company wanted to -- to emit fill material into a lake and the EPA said no, you can't do it, because of the effluent limitations?",
  "But your -- your 40 years of experience then really don't -- don't cover this case. People have been putting it into settling ponds. Let me ask you another question. The other side says that the alternative to this would be even worse, or it sounds worse to me, anyway. What -- what is your solution, closing down the mine? Is there - -",
  "Why do you said the EPA preferred the -- the solution of filling in the wetlands and creating an ash Pentagon?",
  "Well, if it really felt that way, couldn't it simply have vetoed the permit?",
  "So it couldn't have felt very strongly about it.",
  "Right.",
  "It couldn't have preferred it very much, or it would have vetoed this one.",
  "Plankton and stuff.",
  "Well, I guess it could be -- it could be if we have an opinion that makes it clear that you -- you must grant an evidentiary hearing in - - in certain cases. And if the State court did not grant an evidentiary hearing, I guess you could say that that was contrary to established Supreme Court law, couldn't you?",
  "But unless -- unless there is a Supreme Court requirement that there be an evidentiary hearing, I don't see how holding an evidentiary hearing could show that the State court decision, which was legitimately held without an evidentiary hearing, was contrary to our opinions. I don't see how you can do that.",
  "Why -- why should we hold a hearing ourselves in the -- in the hypothetical situation that Justice Souter mentioned? Why shouldn't we just reverse the State courts for not having held an evidentiary hearing? Remand it to them, let them hold it, and let -- let them make the factual determination on the basis of that, after which we would -- we would apply the rather strict 2254 standard to -- to the result of that hearing?",
  "No, I understand that. So your -- your answer to Justice Souter would -- would not be that -- that you can conduct a hearing if the State should have conducted a hearing? What you should do if the State should have conducted a hearing is send it back for the hearing.",
  "Mr. Mercer -- Mr. Mercer, I guess we could resolve the case by saying if there was any error it was harmless, but we didn't take the case for that. That wouldn't be very helpful to the bar, would it? I mean, I thought that the important issue here is -- is the one you've been discussing, whether - - whether, in fact, you're bound to stick with the facts that were -- were adjudicated by the State.",
  "So let's not do that, then. Let's -- let's decide something.",
  "Good.",
  "Excuse me. The issue is not whether it's unreasonable or not. The issue is whether it's an unreasonable application of -- of clearly established Supreme Court law.",
  "Reasonableness or unreasonableness is out of the question. You -- you first just have to look to Supreme Court law and say, is it conceivably an unreasonable application of that. And the -- and the answer to that is we -- we haven't decided the question of whether this is reasonable or unreasonable, and therefore, it cannot possibly be an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.",
  "That's right. That seems to me - -",
  "Is that precisely what we have to decide? Or wouldn't it be whether it would be unreasonable for the State court not to come to that conclusion, which is one step removed?",
  "So -- so the usual test that the State court has to be affirmed unless it's unreasonable application of Supreme Court law is altered when the State court has not had an evidentiary hearing that the Federal habeas court believes should have been held?",
  "How do you get that out of the statute? I don't understand it; it makes no - -",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Excuse me. What do you rely on for the proposition that if -- if you deny a hearing, all of the facts for which the hearing was demanded have to be assumed in favor of the party who asked for the hearing?",
  "No, but that can't be. What if I deny the hearing because there are ample facts that show what the situation was, and a hearing would in my view be absolutely redundant? And therefore all of the facts that support the other side have to be washed out simply because I've denied a hearing?",
  "I wasn't addressing that. I was addressing the proposition that when you deny a hearing, all of the facts for which you demanded the hearing have to be assumed in your favor. I -- it seems to be - -",
  "Twenty-five -- 25, 26, 27, 28, he has 25 years worth of discretion, doesn't he?",
  "I didn't -- I didn't take that to mean under California law, since the jury found the one, it has to find the other. He wasn't making that argument. He was saying any jury that found that this was done intentionally, that this was done, you know, with -- with planning, with -- with cover-up and what not, that jury is not going to find that he was crazy. That's all he was saying, and -- and that seems to me entirely reasonable.",
  "I thought that the rationale of Jackson was that the confession is simply deemed to be coerced if the defendant has expressed - - has expressed -- his desire to have counsel present or even to be represented by counsel. It isn't clear that, which is already a stretch, to assume that simply because I said, you know, I would like to have counsel, if the police continue to say, well, come on, won't you talk to us -- it's already a stretch to say it's automatically coerced. But now you're saying, even if the defendant has never expressed even a desire to be represented by counsel but has simply had counsel appointed, in fact even if he doesn't know about the appointment of counsel, the -- his confession is automatically deemed to be coerced. That seems to me quite, even more extravagant than Jackson.",
  "Right. Right. What has he elected here?",
  "Why? Why would one do that?",
  "It is that, whether or not the defendant initiates the contact. I mean, in civil matters, it's contrary to the ethics of the bar to interrogate the party on the other side when you know he has a lawyer, and that would be the case even if he initiated it. You wouldn't think of negotiating with him without consulting the other lawyer, saying, \"Can I talk to your client?\" So that doesn't stretch over to this, to this situation. We're not applying bar ethical rules. We're applying, supposedly, a rule that determines when a confession is coerced. All right? That's what we're doing here.",
  "Why couldn't we solve your practical problem that we don't know in many States whether the defendant accepted appointment or not, by simply saying it is not enough to simply accept appointment of counsel; you must have requested counsel. To merely say, \"Oh, that's great, you appointed me counsel\" - -",
  "You must have requested it. And that would be in accord with the holding of Michigan v. Jackson and would solve all of your -- all of your practical problems.",
  "What happens under Michigan v. Jackson if I have never requested counsel? I've never asked the court to appoint counsel, but I've gone out and hired counsel of my own, right?",
  "Is it clear from Michigan v. Jackson itself, or - -",
  "We wouldn't be saying that. We would just be saying that it is unrealistic to think that a confession is coerced simply because the police initiated the conversation so long as he said: Okay, I'll speak without my counsel present. That's all we -- I don't see how it would infect any of these other areas. It would just say that's -- that's one bridge too far. This is prophylaxis on prophylaxis.",
  "That's true, but not much else.",
  "That's a different question.",
  "You have to assume that his voluntary relinquishment of it is somehow coerced. I mean there -- there is no way around that. The man has said: I know I have counsel, but that's okay; I'll talk anyway. And you say: So long as the police have initiated that conversation, we will deem it to be coerced. You can't get around the coercion aspect of - - of this matter. But that question is whether that is at all realistic.",
  "Excuse me. I think it's -- I think it's wrong. I think it's common ground that so long as he says, even though I have a lawyer, I'll talk to you, that's okay.",
  "And that's not okay in civil cases, but it's perfectly okay here.",
  "Ms. Landry, I don't really understand what you're arguing here. I thought you were saying there has to be a request in your response to Justice Souter, but then you accept as sufficient his merely saying thank you. That's not a request.",
  "That's what I thought, too. But you were saying there had to be a request. You abandon that? There doesn't have to be a request?",
  "\"Thank you\" is not a request.",
  "Well, I don't -- I don't -- I agree with Justice Souter. I -- acceptance is something different from a request. As I read the - - the State court's opinion, it was setting up a sort of offer and acceptance scenario. The State was offering him counsel, said, \"I appoint counsel,\" but it was ineffective until he says yes, \"I accept counsel,\" whereupon, you know, he's lawyered up, but he isn't lawyered up until he says \"I accept,\" and that's something quite different from -- from requesting counsel.",
  "Now, are you -- are you standing on the -- on the State court's analysis or not?",
  "Of course, the usual legal rule is that silence implies consent, right? Read the prosecution of Thomas More. That's the legal rule. So why shouldn't we assume consent just from the fact that he stood silent?",
  "Mr. Verrilli, I don't understand your response to Justice Ginsburg. I mean, it seems to me, if this thing was going to come in anyway, how could you possibly say it was harmful and not harmless error?",
  "What difference does it make whether it's introduced in the case in chief or whether it's introduced to refute the defendant's assertion that he didn't do it?",
  "I guess when -- when the last two lawyers withdrew because their contracts had expired, I suppose the court could have refused to permit them to withdraw, couldn't it?",
  "Couldn't it say you -- you have an ethical duty; having undertaken representation, and it being very difficult to get anybody else, you - - you stay in the case?",
  "Does it make it not the State's court -- not the State's fault no matter what? Is -- is the court's misfeasance the State's misfeasance? Do you attribute that to the State?",
  "Ms. Rainville, you -- you began your presentation with a statement that gave me so much hope. You said you were going to give us three reasons why we wouldn't have to get into the hairy facts of the case and could decide it on -- on issues of law. Okay? You only mentioned the first. What are the other two?",
  "Remind us of the first.",
  "Well, that sort of gets us into the facts at some point. I mean, that does get us into the facts. What's the third?",
  "What would you think of a rule that said where most of the delay is attributable to the defendant, he doesn't -- he doesn't walk? That seems like a reasonable rule. Whatever the delay is, if most of it is attributable to the defendant himself, it is -- it is not a basis for dismissing the indictment?",
  "That would make it easy to decide this case because the -- the supreme court's opinion acknowledges that most of the -- most of the delay was caused by the defendant.",
  "But it's not going to get you off.",
  "Excuse me, is that the proper remedy? I mean, it seems to me he should appeal to the judge and say, look, this lawyer -- is -- is that the way you solve the problem of -- of an attorney who is not ready, like fire him so you can get another attorney? That seems to me very strange.",
  "Right.",
  "And from what you told me it should have been given, right?",
  "From what you tell me, it should have been given if indeed he was unable to prepare adequately for the trial?",
  "But it doesn't say that; it really does say most of the delay was caused by the inability or unwillingness of assigned counsel, not of the -- of the institution that appoints them, unwillingness or inability of assigned counsel to move the case forward. That looks to me like - -",
  "What -- what do you mean by that precisely? Suppose you have a group of people, the ringleader goes and gets a safecracker, he gets a wheelman, and so forth, all the people he needs for the crime; and he says we are going to call this the -- the Brinks Job Group, okay? We are the Brinks Job Group. But that's the only thing that he has put the group together in order to do. But it's still a group. He calls it a group and he gets all these guys together and they -- they meet and have lunch together, and do a lot of stuff together. Would that meet your -- your condition of a separate association from the predicate acts?",
  "Except insofar as it is directed to the Brinks job.",
  "Why -- why do you need a hierarchy? Why do you need a boss? Why can't it be a democratic mob? I mean, there is no boss and they agree that all of their decisions will be taken unanimously?",
  "Well, that's what you requested. Isn't -- isn't that the instruction you requested?",
  "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I assume that he was responding to the argument that you can establish the enterprise from the mere existence of the pattern of the acts, from the separate acts. And if indeed it takes nothing more than the acts to constitute the enterprise, it seems to me he has a point.",
  "Oh, so we'll forget about your first one.",
  "So - -",
  "What appendix? Not the joint appendix?",
  "All right.",
  "And -- and were they shown to the jury, all of those bank burglaries?",
  "So it is not at issue in this case whether -- whether the entity can be - -",
  "-- derived simply from the predicate acts?",
  "I am -- I am really confused now. I don't -- I am not sure I know what your answer to the question presented is, which is quite simply must an association-in-fact enterprise under RICO have some ascertainable structure beyond that inherent in the commission of predicate crimes by its members and associates? And you -- your answer is no?",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "Right, right.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, but you would have to tell the jury -- you would have to tell the jury you would have to find it. Of course the jury can find it, but the issue is must the jury be told that it has to find it? I think he's conceding - -",
  "Be told it's not enough, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, for you to find that these predicate acts occurred; you must find -- and you can find it just from the predicate acts, if you think the evidence will justify that -- you must find an organization separate from the mere commission of the predicate acts.",
  "I don't know.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, I used to teach contract law and I'll tell you that would have been a breach of contract. That would have been a breach on his part. Now, the government has conceded the breach of the plea agreement. I don't -- I can't understand why they did that, but they apparently have conceded it. Does that mean that we have to ignore it for purposes of deciding what the -- what the remedy is? Ignore the reality that there was a breach? I mean, you know, if the government said, we will ask the court to sentence at the lower end because of the -- the remorse that the defendant has shown, and the defendant then demonstrates that he has no remorse by -- you know, suppose he comes and stabs the judge -- is the government really supposed to have to go before the judge and say, \"Your Honor, this man is really remorseful and you should sentence him at the lower end\"? It seems to me it's a basic principle of contract law that a party to a contract cannot take action which makes it impracticable for the other side to carry out his part of the bargain, and that's what your client did. The government couldn't practicably go in and make that argument when he had demonstrated himself to be an unremorseful criminal.",
  "Oh.",
  "Where is that in the record, do you know offhand? Where the plea agreement is?",
  "Thank you.",
  "Why wouldn't it suffice to give your client everything that he was entitled to if the case were remanded to a different judge and the government were required to go before that judge and make the commitment that it undertook in the plea agreement?",
  "Why wouldn't that be a perfectly satisfactory remedy?",
  "Well, you have to say that. But let's assume I don't agree with that. Let's assume I agree with Justice Alito that his entry into it was voluntary and all that's happened is that one of the commitments on the part of one of the parties has not been complied with. Why isn't it an adequate remedy for that problem to send it back to a new judge and have the government come before that judge and make the same commitment it was supposed to under the agreement?",
  "It doesn't -- it doesn't retroactively render the government's promise a misrepresentation. Every time a -- a party to a contract fails to comply with a contract, he hasn't been guilty of fraud. \"Misrepresentation\" would mean the government had no intention of complying with it when - - when it entered into it, and you -- you don't assert that was the case, do you?",
  "So you are saying, if -- if I understand you correctly, that even if at the trial your client's lawyer had objected and had -- and had said, Your Honor, the government promised to recommend, you know, a lower thing, what the trial judge would have to have said was, the plea agreement is invalid. And the trial judge could not say, oh, yes, the government has to make that recommendation. You are -- you are saying it is invalidated by the mere fact of the government's not having done it, right?",
  "So no objection need to be made or can be made, right?",
  "Wow.",
  "Well, that's inconsistent with the answer you gave me.",
  "The answer you gave me is that automatically the guilty plea is washed out - - automatically.",
  "It is automatically washed out?",
  "And, therefore, he cannot -- he cannot sit around and wait to see what happens. What happens is -- whatever happens, it's invalid. The plea agreement is no good. You have to have a new trial.",
  "Voidable -- then your answer to me would be different. It's -- it's not void. It's voidable, so that he can play dog in the manger and wait and see what happens, and then if it's in interest that -- in his interest to void it, he does. If it's in his interest not to void it, he doesn't.",
  "I think it's plain. What about paragraph 9? Are you ignoring paragraph 9?",
  "Why can't you argue that what happens when you are not within the safe harbor is simply that the time period cannot alone govern, all right, but it can still be part of the list of things that can be taken into account in determining voluntariness under (b). Why doesn't that reconcile the two provisions?",
  "But admissibility is defined in 3501 itself. (A) says that it shall be admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given; and (b) says what factors will be taken into account in determining whether it's voluntarily given.",
  "I agree with that. It is not alone enough.",
  "So if you are outside of that safe harbor you cannot rely upon the time alone. But why can't you rely on the time plus the other factors?",
  "It's not being admissible solely on the basis -- I'm sorry. Delay is not the only factor being considered in making the inadmissibility call. Delay is one of the things; whereas, within the safe harbor delay can't be taken into account at all.",
  "Right.",
  "No. It -- it leaves it in effect only if you ignore (a) and (b). (A) says that it's admissible if it's voluntary - -",
  "-- and (b) says it's voluntary if you take into account the five factors, one of which is the period of time before arraignment.",
  "But they are synonymous as used in (a).",
  "(A) says that if it's - - it's admissible if it's voluntary.",
  "Mr. McColgin, what do you do with the problem that the proviso only makes a delay longer than six hours nondestructive of the admissibility of the confession if the delay beyond six hours \"is found by the trial judge to be reasonable considering the means of transportation and the distance to be traveled to the nearest available magistrate judge or other officer.\" I can think of a lot of reasons why you can't do it within six hours other than the means of transportation and the distance to be traveled.",
  "You see, if you take the government's position that it really doesn't matter, it gets thrown back into (b), and you can take all those factors into account, and the ultimate question is whether the confession was reasonable. But if you take your position, the defendant automatically walks, or at least his confession is automatically thrown out, and the only exception made is if the means of transportation and the distance to be traveled made six hours impracticable.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, that certainly is a very back-door way of doing it, isn't it?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, wouldn't - - wouldn't you still have this disincentive which - - wouldn't you still have this disincentive, which is considerable? If you -- if you exceed the time limit, it may be taken into account in determining that the confession was involuntary.",
  "Isn't that enough of a disincentive? If you delay too long, that delay is one of the factors to be taken into account in deciding whether the confession was voluntary.",
  "But isn't your -- I'm sorry.",
  "I must be losing the thread of the argument. It seems to me that McNabb and Mallory only provide punishment for excessive delay where there has been a confession. Isn't that right?",
  "And so long as the length of the -- the delay can still be considered as one of the elements in determining that the confession -- that the confession is involuntary, there is still a degree of incentive based upon only the confession. Now, it - - it may not be as high a degree -- that it is automatically excluded -- but the police are going to have to consider that any confession they may get within that period of excessive delay may be challengeable.",
  "I knew you were going to get to 3501 eventually.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, I tend to think that what we should be focusing on is the language of 3501. Can I bring you back to that? What I do not understand about your argument is the following: The six -- the six-hour safe harbor applies only when the confession is made voluntarily, right? I would think that the proviso likewise assumes voluntariness. That is, the time limitation contained in this subsection, it's a time limitation applicable to voluntary confessions. And it says that time limitation shall not apply in any case in which the delay in bringing the person is beyond six hours is found by the trial judge to be reasonable. I think you have already voluntariness assumed in the proviso, but you want us to go back and re -- reconsider voluntariness under (a). I just don't think that's -- that's a fair way to read it.",
  "Well, I am reading it that way, too. Otherwise voluntary is in the safe harbor.",
  "Then when you have a proviso, which refers to the time limitation contained in this subsection, it's a time limitation upon voluntary confessions.",
  "When does -- when does the Sixth Amendment violation occur?",
  "Do you -- do we have any other situation in which, for purposes of impeaching testimony, a constitutional violation results?",
  "It's parallel to the Fifth.",
  "Ms. Saharsky, I am still a little hung up on -- on whether we would be allowing a constitutional violation. General McAllister said that in the Fifth Amendment area we -- we indeed allow - - allow it to be introduced in rebuttal even though that is the actual constitutional violation. Isn't that the case other than in the Miranda situation? I mean, suppose you have a generally coerced confession. Would we -- would we permit that to go in?",
  "Exactly, but why -- why is not that the case with the right to counsel?",
  "But its real meaning is that counsel is guaranteed at trial; isn't that right?",
  "Its root purpose is that counsel is guaranteed at trial. And here we're saying it's okay not to have counsel at trial so long as it's refuting a lie by the defendant.",
  "So you say that -- you say the Sixth Amendment violation occurs before trial?",
  "That's right.",
  "That wouldn't be deciding it the same way twice. Initially, they would just have to decide whether -- whether the alien has shown by clear and convincing evidence that he should win, and if they decide no, he hasn't, then at the merits stage they have to decide which one prevails by a preponderance of the evidence. So it's really a different call the second time.",
  "That's true.",
  "What do you claim that (f)(2) covers, if it doesn't cover these stays?",
  "Why would he seek to enjoin his removal when he is subject to a much lesser standard when he just seeks to stay the removal? I mean, does he have a bad lawyer or what?",
  "Why wouldn't he go to the court of appeals, is the next question.",
  "That's a fluke. I mean, that is a flukey situation. And I find it hard to believe that (f)(2) was meant to address just that.",
  "Also a fluke. We don't expect the -- the executive to ignore a stay.",
  "Is that in IMLA or is that in the Rehabilitation Act?",
  "The other side says that certain standard provisions in the IMLA leases did not exist in this lease. Is that accurate?",
  "With the forms?",
  "I don't understand your answer. If you say that those were not relevant and, therefore, they were not covered - -",
  "In the Rehabilitation Act, the requirements for approval of lease, is -- is that applicable to mineral leases?",
  "Yes.",
  "What do you do about the fact that the term of this lease would -- would not be permitted under the Rehabilitation Act?",
  "Which is all that the Rehabilitation Act -- I'm sorry.",
  "Expired - -",
  "Mr. Phillips, the government says that by the time this lease was executed, the Rehabilitation Act was a dead letter. That it was meant to stimulate economic activity on the Navajo reservation, and there were funds appropriated for that purpose and that all had been played out by the time this lease was entered into. Is there something wrong with that?",
  "You bring in Federal officials to testify years after the fact as to what basis they acted earlier? That's very strange to me. I don't know what -- what motive Secretary Udall has today that might induce him to say that.",
  "If there was some statement at the time, I could understand it, but bringing him in how many years after -- 40 years after?",
  "What did Secretary Udall think about this?",
  "You don't need a good reason for a peremptory challenge.",
  "That's the whole fun of a peremptory challenge: You don't need a good reason.",
  "Exactly. And for some reason, I just think this person is not going to vote for me. I don't know why. I just don't think so. I don't want this person sitting on the jury. That's all the reason you need.",
  "Well, if you - -",
  "The authority to challenge preemptory challenge rights entirely? Right?",
  "So this is not a hard question.",
  "And, therefore, it could take the much lesser step of allowing the trial judge, if he has any suspicion that a peremptory-challenge right is being used in violation of Batson, to disallow it. What is wrong with that.",
  "Well, does it really? Suppose I agree with you that there is -- there is no Federal constitutional violation. But I also think that in assessing the consequence of a State-law violation the Illinois court here was looking to Federal law and was trying to apply the Federal law of harmless error. If that's the situation, would we not have the obligation to determine, or wouldn't we have the obligation to determine, whether it was properly applying the Federal law of harmless error? Even though it didn't have to, it chose to use the Federal law of harmless error to -- to apply to this State violation.",
  "So the Illinois Supreme Court can happily go along blaming everything on us, so when it stands for reelection, it can say, well, we are just applying Federal law.",
  "I know, but that's the consequence of your answer to that question. It seems to me there is much to be said for the disposition that where a State court even in resolving a State-law question uses a Federal principle, adverts specifically to Federal law and cites Federal cases, it would cover you.",
  "I would certainly agree that if the only reason the Illinois Supreme Court used the Federal harmless-error rule was because it was assuming a Federal constitutional violation, once we reject that assumption, the whole thing drops out. But is that entirely clear from the opinion?",
  "Is it clear that the Illinois Supreme Court wouldn't have used the same test under simply Illinois law?",
  "The problem is the -- the only reason the Illinois Supreme Court found: That there was no error of constitutional dimension, meaning Federal constitutional dimension. The only reason it - - it found that is because it found that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.",
  "It is the cart before the horse.",
  "You have to get rid of Quackenbush, too, don't you?",
  "Throw that overboard, too?",
  "Well, that's right, but what if we want to get rid of it?",
  "I would have thought you would have similarly answered Justice Kennedy's question differently and would have said that just because something's wasted doesn't mean that it is waste. I mean, you may waste part of what is delivered, but what is spilled is -- it doesn't seem to me to be waste.",
  "Excuse me. You say in the process of delivery. I thought that this material became the property of the buyer when the truck arrived. Are you saying it only -- it only became the property of the buyer when it was unloaded from the truck?",
  "What does \"FOB\" normally mean?",
  "I think -- I think it's something of a misdescription to say that this spillage is occurring in the course of delivery.",
  "I think as far as Shell was concerned, delivery had been made when the truck pulled up.",
  "You're making it.",
  "Excuse me.",
  "You mean it could have - - could have adopted some other means?",
  "That's all you mean by having control over it.",
  "All right. So all you're requiring is knowledge that using this means will - - will result in a spill. I don't think knowledge alone is enough for -- I think you need purpose. If you arrange for disposal, I think you have to have a purpose. It -- it has to be your object to have the oil leaking along the highway as you go. Merely knowing that it's going to be leaking, I mean, there may be some other way under the statute that you can find liability on the part of the shipper, but not, it seems to me, on the -- on the ground that the shipper arranged for this leak. He didn't want the leak. He knew it was happening, but that was not the object of the transport.",
  "All right.",
  "Is that a finding? Do we have to take it as a given that this was an indivisible harm?",
  "That -- that would not?",
  "Would it violate the Admission Act if the legislature had not said -- said we are giving it to them because we want to, because we think it's a good idea. No, we are giving it to them because we think they have a right to it.",
  "And we feel that we must give it to them because it's theirs.",
  "Would that violate the Admission Act?",
  "Did you answer my question just then?",
  "Please, let me put my question again. Let's assume that the legislature does not say, we want to give it to the Native Hawaiians because we like the Native Hawaiians or because we think they deserve it; but, rather, we think we have to give it to the Native Hawaiians because it's theirs.",
  "I think it would be.",
  "Is -- is it the function of the Hawaiian Supreme Court to declare moral obligations?",
  "Would there be any problem -- certainly there is noted the legislature deems there to be a moral obligation and gives the land away on that basis. But do you -- do you think there -- there might be some democracy problem if -- if the Supreme Court of Hawaii goes around pronouncing moral obligations and - - and giving away land on that basis?",
  "Why doesn't the Hawaii Supreme Court's reliance upon Hawaiian law to establish that there is some property right on the part of these native Hawaiians -- why doesn't that conflict with Federal law?",
  "I don't care what you call it; it's a property interest.",
  "As I read the Federal law, it extinguished all property rights in these lands; the lands were transferred to the Federal Government; and the Federal Government transferred them in absolute fee without any encumbrances to the State of Hawaii. Now if you are telling me the Hawaii Supreme Court is now finding as a matter of State law that there is a property interest on the part of the Native Hawaiians -- I don't care what you call it, equitable or whatever - - it seems to me that is flat contradiction of Federal law, and probably is an issue that we ought to address in this opinion.",
  "They do nothing at all? Could I get back to Justice Breyer's three-sentence pro curiam, where we just say to the extent that the Supreme Court of Hawaii relied upon the Apology Resolution as creating any -- any property entitlement in the Hawaiians, it was in error. Okay, we send it back to the Hawaiian Supreme Court and the Hawaii Supreme Court smiles, and doesn't do a blessed thing. Leaves - - leaves the injunction against any distribution of the land in effect. What -- what happens then?",
  "You don't?",
  "Not if we said \"to the extent that.\" I mean, if we said it is -- it's grounded on the proposition that the Apology Resolution creates property rights, and that's wrong; then they have to do something.",
  "To the extent that it may be grounded on that, we take no position on whether it's grounded on that or not - -",
  "Is the court the trustee?",
  "The State is the trustee. So I assume it would be up to the State officers to decide to what extent the obligation to the Hawaiians, among the five obligations, should be given precedence. Is the Supreme Court of Hawaii directing the State officers to give it precedence?",
  "And saying that the trustee must direct it primarily to -- to that among the five ends.",
  "And all this comes from the fact that Congress made reference to and approved a so-called reconciliation process?",
  "So in -- in perpetuam, this land can't be transferred because Congress approved the this reconciliation process?",
  "I see.",
  "Or denying it to them?",
  "I don't quite understand. You mean -- you mean a Federal court can enjoin the sale of my house, and there is nothing I can do about it inasmuch as I do not have any present intention of selling my house - -",
  "-- except to live under that injunction.",
  "You -- you say there is no controversy, so I -- I cannot get its validity adjudicated, right?",
  "I don't think that -- I don't think that the State has to have an immediate intention to sell any particular piece of land in order to object to an injunction against any sale of land by the State in the future. I -- I don't think it has to wait until it -- it wants to sell a particular plot.",
  "But there is. The State says that I am free to sell the land, and -- and the Court says, no, you are not. Isn't that a dispute?",
  "Mr. Shanmugam, you -- you didn't raise in -- in your opposition to the petition the -- the question of mootness.",
  "Well, you don't have to preserve it. I mean it's -- it's an issue of Article III jurisdiction, so we would have to look into it on our -- on our own. But it does suggest that it is not a very strong string to your bow, if I may put it that way.",
  "You think he knowingly stole the car that belonged to Mr. Jones, would that be the parallel?",
  "You left out the \"knowingly.\" Once you put in \"knowingly\" - -",
  "You are making it very hard for me to vote with you, I must say. I thought you had a pretty good -- a pretty good case. But if you are going to say somebody who has five identity cards, faces of individuals, presumably they are real individuals - -",
  "I thought that was the hypothetical. Five different -- the person has five identity cards of real people, and -- and you don't know that he knows that its the identity cards of a real person, but he used it.",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "Of course.",
  "You have to rename it the rule of, you know, who gets hurt the most or something.",
  "Is this in the statute?",
  "Well, let's not say Congress, then. Does -- does the Committee?",
  "You could also say you get two years for knowing that there is a discreet victim. I mean -- I -- you can describe it either way.",
  "And it makes sense either way.",
  "Is any of them called punitive damages? Do you know of any case in which a court has - -",
  "And punitive damages, of course, requires that you first find the guilty person to lose the case. So what if a person makes these terrible allegations, but ends up winning the case anyway, and -- and -- well, you couldn't impose punitive damages.",
  "We've got to call it something else, don't we?",
  "Whose dissent was that? I have forgotten that. Whose dissent was it? Do you recall? Stewart?",
  "Excuse me, that the maintenance and cure claim could proceed or that the punitive damages claim could be made?",
  "Well, why -- why does joining it to a Jones Act case help?",
  "Do you think Stewart knew more about these -- these obscure, ancient cases than we do?",
  "Do you think he knew more about these obscure, ancient cases than we do?",
  "Had he had the benefit of briefs by Professor Robertson and -- I think not, right?",
  "It was just sort of off the top of his head that he thought there should be punitive damages.",
  "They -- they normally are, but the question is whether there -- whether this - - this is a different quiver.",
  "We've abandoned that.",
  "Exactly. We've abandoned that in this hearing. We said what we do with these admiralty causes of action we should be guided by what Congress has done in the Death on the High Seas Act and the Jones Act. Do you acknowledge that there are no punitive damages available in the event of death?",
  "Well, that -- you want to talk about what's a sensible system and what is not a sensible system. In the days when Massachusetts used to have a -- when I was in law school, they had a compensation limit for wrongful death, but to limit for pain and suffering, for negligence; and the line was back her up again -- back her up again, Sam, she's not quite dead yet.",
  "Is -- is -- is this going to be the same thing, where -- where the ship owner says, well, you know, if -- if -- if I treat him badly enough that he dies, I don't get hit with the punitive damages?",
  "Yeah, but it is invited, isn't it?",
  "It certainly makes these maintenance and care cases a lot more attractive to the plaintiffs' bar doesn't it? I mean, one of your complaints is there's just no money in it. The claim is not for that much.",
  "Of course it shouldn't be the goal. But we're inquiring into the question of whether granting punitive damages will increase or decrease the number of lawsuits. I -- I -- I would think it would be astounding if it would decrease the number of lawsuits.",
  "I wish it were as clearcut as that. I mean, what if the seaman says, you know, I should have had this very expensive treatment? And the ship owner's medical counsel said, no, this treatment is not necessary. Is that -- is that a punitive damages claim? I bet it is.",
  "He's going to say that was willful and wanton. I obviously needed this more expensive treatment. He just didn't want to pay the money.",
  "Would the other side concede the premise that he doesn't say that this is going to exonerate him? That he has -- you know - - here's some -- some evidence out there. It may help me; it may hurt me. I don't know which, but I'd like to see it. Is that the only claim he's making? If so, it's - - it's a lot less -- what should I say -- a lot less plausible a constitutional claim. There's some evidence that I'd like to look at; I'm not saying it will prove me innocent. I'd just like to look at this evidence. Might, might not. That's a lot weaker claim than what I had thought he was making, which is the claim that this -- this new scientific evidence will -- will prove my innocence.",
  "Well, which is he doing here? Is he saying the latter or not?",
  "So it's not a constitutional claim of entitlement to evidence which he asserts will prove his innocence, but rather a constitutional claim to evidence which might or then might not prove his innocence? Is that - -",
  "Well, we're assuming the premise, though, in the questioning.",
  "That was not the state of the art at the time, was it?",
  "He didn't ask for that.",
  "Of course, that relief would require him to assert his innocence, wouldn't it? He would have to bring a habeas corpus action claiming that the State has no business holding him because in fact he's innocent? He doesn't want to do that? He just wants to say, I'd just like to see this evidence. It might help me. It might not help me, but - -",
  "I thought you said the State has -- has indeed granted a habeas request. In that case, where it granted the habeas request, although it turned out that the evidence was destroyed, in that case surely the same situation -- the same situation existed.",
  "It is the case you are referring to. I didn't -- I didn't make it up. You did.",
  "No. I'm talking about the case you alluded to earlier where you say the State of Alaska had indeed provided DNA evidence or had agreed to provide it - -",
  "-- but for the fact that it no longer existed. Now, in that case surely the same problem existed that Justice Souter is -- is raising. That -- that person also, while claiming innocence, couldn't say for sure what the evidence would produce, but that didn't stop the State from providing it; did it?",
  "I thought you said they were still pending.",
  "You think we could attach that to the new constitutional right that we invent? It would be a constitutional right to get it if -- if - - but if you lose, you get another three years? Could we say that?",
  "Especially, I would assume, one constitutional right in which you do not even have to assert your innocence.",
  "Which apparently he had told her about.",
  "If you accept that -- of course it does; and this is not a new procedure. I -- I didn't understand it to be a new procedure, as Justice Breyer has described it. It is the procedure of habeas corpus. They have a procedure for habeas corpus which includes discovery, and all he has to do is come in and say, you know, I have been wrongfully convicted; I am innocent; and I want to discover this evidence in order to establish it, so that I can get out of jail.",
  "It is very strange. Why did they do that, I wonder.",
  "There was a lot of other evidence in the case, wasn't there?",
  "I don't know what they thought they were doing.",
  "And you will see cases where the defendant maintained that the defendant was innocent. Now, whether this was a requirement imposed by Alaska or not, it seems to me you cannot point to the practice of the other States and say Alaska must have the same practice. When, in fact, you don't comply with the practices of the other States. Almost all of them do require an assertion of innocence, which your client has not made. I cannot imagine how you can simply -- oh, look at all these other -- 44 other states, when your client does not meet the requirements that those States would impose.",
  "His counsel -- his counsel forwent the DNA testing, and we attribute the actions of counsel to the defendant.",
  "But they will have acquired the advantage of having a chance of the jury's acquitting them at the trial. Because by not asking for the DNA testing, they was a chance the jury might let them off. Had they asked for it then and had it shown conclusively, the game was over. So it is gaming the system.",
  "Ex-ante. We're -- we're looking at it at the time of the trial. Does its pay for the defendant to ask for a DNA test? Well, of course, it doesn't. Because if he asks for it and it - - it finds that he's guilty, that's the end of it. There is no chance of the jury acquitting him.",
  "So why not just not ask for it and if it turns out that the jury happens to convict him anyway, then ask for it?",
  "That's a biggie, though.",
  "I am quite dubious that - - that he would indeed sign it. I -- I was really struck by his affidavit in this case, number -- or paragraph 9 of which says: \"I have no doubt whatsoever that retesting of the condom will prove once and for all time\" -- and one expects to follow -- my innocence. That's not what it says. \"Will prove once and for all time either my guilt or innocence.\"",
  "I mean, you know, what is this?",
  "Well, you would still want to leave yourself open to make the objection that he had a chance to get this at trial and -- and -- and decided not to get it.",
  "Wouldn't those objections continue to apply?",
  "I mean, it -- it seems to me that -- that all -- all that you have to concede is that there is some means for him to get into court, with those -- those exceptions that other States make; and other States make an exception for gaming the system. So, so long as he can get in in habeas corpus it seems to me you can very well leave for later whether you are going to concede that even though -- even though he didn't ask for it at trial, he can get it now.",
  "Well, why give it away?",
  "-- any more than you gave away the fact that this is going to - -",
  "Why do you say that section 2 -- it isn't at all clear to me that section 2 says State law determines whether somebody not a party to the arbitration agreement can -- can enforce it.",
  "Including enforceability by whom?",
  "If he can do it under State law?",
  "Who says? Have we ever held that?",
  "A guarantee against even - -",
  "\"Has always endeavored.\"",
  "\"Has always endeavored.\" \"Has always endeavored.\"",
  "And there are rules in the States that do endeavor to do that.",
  "And you claim that there is such a temptation here because of gratitude?",
  "You've been around Washington a long time. How far do you think gratitude goes in -- in the general political world?",
  "Yes, but that -- that person contributed money to my election because he expected me to be a fair and impartial judge. And I would be faithful to that contributor only by being a fair and impartial judge. That is showing gratitude. I should do what he expected me to do, and I have no reason to think he expected me to lie and distort cases in order to come out his way. What I expected he wanted me to do was to be a good judge, and I'm being faithful to him and I'm -- I'm showing my gratitude by -- by being a good judge.",
  "It isn't a matter of honor and sacrifice. You talk as though what gratitude consists of is coming out in favor of this fellow, but that is not necessarily what gratitude consists of. Gratitude consists of performing the way this person would like me to perform. Now, in this case, I will acknowledge that you seem to have a contribution based upon more. This contributor never even met the judge, did he?",
  "They're certainly not good buddies.",
  "And his contributions, as I understand it, were mainly based upon his opposition to the incumbent, who he thought was an activist judge that -- that was distorting the tort law of the State, all in favor of the plaintiffs' bar. And if -- if the contribution were to engender any gratitude, it seems to me it would simply be that this other candidate would do what he promised in his campaign and that is not be an activist judge and not distort the tort law of the State.",
  "No, they don't say that.",
  "There are only two categories of cases, only two categories. One -- one is where the judge is almost the aggrieved party in conducting contempt proceedings against someone who is contemptuous of that very judge, and the other one is cases where the judges have a financial interest. That's far from this broad category of whenever there is a possibility of bias. I was appointed to the bench by Ronald Reagan. Should I be any -- should I have been any less grateful to Ronald Reagan than -- than the judge here was grateful to the person who spent a lot of money in his election?",
  "Two categories are the only categories in which it has applied that.",
  "Nice, clear, and true. Are you going to tell me why I shouldn't have been grateful to Ronald Reagan?",
  "And he had a lot of, a lot of issues coming before me while his presidency continued.",
  "Was their standard the same as yours? I mean, that's frankly one of the problems in this case. The various amici and -- and you come up with, you know, a wide divergence of standards. And all of them say: By the way, these seven factors or five factors or six factors, whatever they say, are not exhaustive; There may be others as well.",
  "Right?",
  "But not the only central factor.",
  "You said it's one central factor.",
  "You really have no test other than probability of bias. We can't -- we can't run a system on -- on such a vague standard.",
  "Not -- not for situations that have such an infinite variety as -- as the appointment of judges and the election of judges and - - and as funding your opponent or -- or declining to fund or joining some agglomeration of -- of other institutions that fund. The -- the variety is immense, and you give us nothing to hang onto except, you know, case by case we're going to have to decide whether there's a probability of bias.",
  "Don't you think it would be easier to solve the problem, as some States have done, not by having this -- this raffle for -- for whatever judge gets -- gets stricken from the case or not, but simply limiting the amount of contributions that can be made? Isn't -- isn't that a much more sensible solution?",
  "And some of them are doing that.",
  "I thought they closed the 527 loophole that allowed him to contribute so much above the individual limit.",
  "I don't think we adopted his principle, did we, in the obscenity area?",
  "Of course the appearance standard is -- is wonderfully ratchetable. Once it is clearly established that a certain -- certain set of facts creates the appearance of impropriety, that is solidly established, then the set of facts right next to that suddenly acquires the appearance of impropriety because it's so -- it's so close to what is obviously improper. And -- and so we go down and down and down. And I -- I personally don't favor a constitutional rule that is a sliding scale like that.",
  "We have no choice with regard to the reasonableness standard. We -- it's not a standard we made up.",
  "-- as we would have been making up this one. It's there in the Constitution.",
  "We have to make the most of it, do the best we can do with it. But here we're being urged to adopt out of nowhere a new standard of probability of bias. That's not in the Constitution, and it's perfectly valid to ask, is that a sensible standard?",
  "Are you going to finally get to discussing the debt of gratitude point?",
  "I've been waiting and waiting.",
  "It doesn't matter what language you use because it's pretty vague anyway - - \"probability,\" \"likelihood,\" \"appearance\" -- it doesn't really - -",
  "I'm really anxious to hear what you have to say on debt of gratitude.",
  "Wait, you can't have it both ways. I mean, if your response to the first question is judges have lifetime tenure, you then can't respond to the second question would it make a difference if he was term limited by saying, no, it wouldn't make a difference.",
  "What is the purpose -- what is the purpose of saying who uses a communications facility? Is that purely a jurisdictional hook?",
  "Your argument sort of assumes -- more than sort of assumes; it assumes -- that facilitating is the same as aiding and abetting. If they meant aiding and abetting, it's a classic criminal law term, they could have said aiding and abetting. They didn't. They used a different term, facilitating. Why should I think facilitating means aiding and abetting?",
  "What -- this statute does not just apply to facilitating a drug offense. It applies to any of the felonies covered by subchapter 2 of the relevant chapter. I agree, it seems a little strange to have what is a misdemeanor by a buyer converted into a -- into a felony just by use of the phone. What other situations under other felony provisions would arise that create a similar oddity? Do you have any in mind?",
  "I don't understand what you're saying. The use of a phone may be more difficult?",
  "Not just that, he gets a felony on his record. Before that he would have had just a misdemeanor; right?",
  "Counsel, what do you do - - this case that I find pretty close to what we have here is Rewis v. United States, which involved a statute that prohibited interstate travel with the intent to, quote, \"promote, manage, establish, carry on or facilitate\" certain kinds of illegal activities, one of which would have been gambling. And we said the ordinary meaning of this language suggests that the traveler's purpose must involve more than the desire to patronize the illegal activity. So it wouldn't have been facilitating a gambling operation simply to be engaging in interstate travel for the purpose of playing the tables.",
  "Oh, it certainly focused on the word \"facilitate.\" That was the whole purpose of that passage. It said -- it quoted \"promote, manage, establish, carry on or facilitate,\" and the ordinary meaning of this language suggests the traveler's purpose must involve more than the desire to patronize the illegal activity.",
  "Don't you think that the \"knowingly\" in this statute also requires that you are knowingly facilitating?",
  "Okay. So this is the same thing here.",
  "Well, this didn't mention -- this statute didn't mention purpose, either, did it?",
  "I find it pretty close, I really do.",
  "Except that the use of a phone in this statute is applied to the seller as well as to the buyer. I mean, it seems to me it is parallel: use of a phone to commit the offense by the seller, and you want us to similarly sweep in the facilitating of the offense by the use of the phone by the buyer. It seems to me pretty parallel to what we've done in the buyer-seller rule.",
  "Let's feel sorry for this -- for the felon who is selling this stuff, too. I mean, the same thing is true of him, isn't it? Every time he makes another phone call he gets socked with another how many years?",
  "Yes, so four times four times four every time he makes a phone call.",
  "We should feel sorry for him, too.",
  "Excuse me. What -- what -- I guess I'm not following this. You say it would be true that if the blank -- if the bank guard fires his own gun when -- when the bank robber is fleeing, that would come within this?",
  "You say under the government's it would? I don't think it would under the government's either. Do you?",
  "Ah, that's different, yes.",
  "I guess it's also the government's view -- this is even weirder -- that it doesn't matter who brandishes the gun. The -- the bank guard grabs the gun and brandishes the gun, and that also gets additional time served for the bank robber. It doesn't seem fair.",
  "Well, this is conduct. I mean, it isn't just bad luck. This is -- what we have here is a negligent bank robber. I mean, he has left the safety off, okay, and -- and trips the gun. I mean, bank robbing is bad enough, but negligent bank robbing is something - -",
  "-- is something that should be punished more severely.",
  "Excuse me? That would be for the judge?",
  "Which -- it's during the bank robbery.",
  "Why? You place a lot of reliance on this: During and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime. But that - - that's in the prologue, and it applies only to the matter covered in the prologue -- to wit, \"During and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm or in furtherance of any such crime possesses a firearm.\" That -- that's what all that language \"during and relation to\" applies to. And then it continues: \"Shall,\" if that \"in relation to\" exists, \"in addition to the punishment provided for such crime:\" One, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than five\"; two; and number three, what we're dealing with here, \"if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than ten years.\" I don't see how that language during and in relation to any crime of violence applies to anything, except the use or carrying of a firearm.",
  "Why is that? How could you -- how could you make the lack of connection any clearer than by ending the first, the introduction with a dash, and then putting 1, 2, and 3? I mean, it seems to me that it applies to the portion before the dash.",
  "How would -- how would a discharge not be during and in relation to? Give me an example of -- of what you're worried about.",
  "But that -- excuse me. That's not -- that's not covered. Number 3 only applies to someone who has already been guilty of what's set forth in the prologue.",
  "And that's the only connection that's necessary. You have to have done what was set forth in the prologue, and it has -- has to be in the course of doing that. But \"the course of doing that\" means just in the course of using a firearm in connection with the bank robbery.",
  "Why do we have to find that the phrase \"if a firearm is brandished\" and the later phrase \"if a firearm is discharged\" require intentional brandishing and intentional discharging? Why can't we limit it by saying, oh, of course it means if the firearm is brandished by the bank robber or by the felon or if it's discharged by the felon, but leaving it quite undetermined whether it has to be intentionally discharged, or even intentionally brandished for that matter.",
  "The definition of brandishing, I guess, requires some intent to put another person in fear.",
  "Does it require that the discharge be during and in relation to the crime? I mean, suppose the bank robber, you know, he sees -- son of a gun, he sees among the customers a man that ran off with his wife a year ago, and he is just overcome with anger, and he -- you know, he takes a shot at this guy. It's not in relation to the bank robbery. Would - - would that discharge be covered?",
  "Yes.",
  "Do you think that - - regardless of whether it's intentional or accidental, do you think he has to discharge it or that he has to brandish it? It is the passive voice. Does it mean if anybody discharges it or brandishes it?",
  "Grabs it out of his hand and brandishes it.",
  "We don't really have to decide all this stuff, do we? We just have to decide whether if he discharges it the discharge has to be intentional.",
  "It has to be during the crime.",
  "And you say it can't come from the prologue, because if it came from the prologue, it wouldn't apply to the mere possession.",
  "And the possession could be at any time, before the crime, after the crime, whatever.",
  "So you have to import some -- some contemporaneous -- contemporaneous requirement into the 1, 2, and 3.",
  "What if it's committed when the guy is trying to escape, and the gun goes off accidentally? Is that in -- I mean is that during the crime?",
  "Two hours later when he got home -- he carried the gun in -- IN furtherance of the crime. He still had it with him all the way through, and the gun went off after he left the bank.",
  "It's not your argument because if that was the only -- if that was the source of the contemporaneous requirement, there would be no contemporaneous requirement for the in furtherance?",
  "The provision -- the in furtherance provision.",
  "And, of course, some of these difficult hypotheticals such as the one that Justice Stevens put about the gun going off while the - - while the individual is escaping, that's going to be a problem whether you adopt your interpretation or the - - or the petitioner's interpretation, even if you assume that it has to be during and in relation to it's still going to be a problem. Is this -- is this during and in relation to the crime.",
  "If it occurs, you know, five hours later while he's escaping, I don't know.",
  "You don't have to decide that.",
  "But we said -- we said in Ashe, didn't we, that you should take into account all the circumstances in determining what was decided in the first acquittal, all the circumstances. How can -- how can you close your eyes to the circumstance that is alleged here, that the -- the hung jury portion of the jury's verdict is simply inconsistent with the acquittal portion, and therefore you should not count the acquittal for double jeopardy purposes? Isn't this part of the total circumstances?",
  "It shows -- it shows that -- that the point on which they -- you assert they were unanimous and the point on which you say later prosecution should be disallowed was in fact a point on which the jury was confused, because they would have come out the other way if indeed they were unanimous on the counts that -- that acquitted. They should have come out the same way on the -- on the hung counts.",
  "The point is that they were deadlocked and would not have been deadlocked, assuming we don't inquire into -- into the issue that Justice Souter raised -- they were deadlocked and would not have been deadlocked if indeed they made the -- the acquittal finding that you're relying upon for double jeopardy.",
  "You can educate in 30 seconds. I mean in -- in a 30-second ad you present just one of these criticisms of the candidate instead of lumping all of them together for 90 minutes.",
  "Isn't that education?",
  "Wait, are you making a statutory argument now or a constitutional argument? What Congress was trying to do has nothing to do, it seems to me, with the constitutional point you're arguing.",
  "So you're making a statutory argument now?",
  "You're saying that this - - this isn't covered by it.",
  "Mr. Olson, I -- I think we've been led astray by -- by the constant reference to what Congress intended. As I understood your point, it was not -- it was not that, well, one is covered by the statute and the other isn't, but it is that one is covered by the Constitution and the other isn't. And it may well be that -- that the kind of speech that is reflected in a serious 90-minute documentary is entitled to greater constitutional protection. And it may well be that the kind of speech that is not only offered but invited by the listener is entitled to -- is entitled to heightened First Amendment scrutiny, which is -- which is what this is since you have pay for view - -",
  "And -- and you -- you get around the fact that this would extend to any publishing corporation by saying that there is a media exemption because the Constitution guarantees not only freedom of speech but also of the press?",
  "But does \"the press\" mean the media in that Constitutional provision? You think in 1791 there were -- there were people running around with fedoras that had press -- little press tickets in it, \"Press\"? Is that what \"press\" means in the Constitution? Doesn't it cover the Xerox machine? Doesn't it cover the right of any individual to -- to write, to publish?",
  "Well, I don't see any reason why it wouldn't. I'm saying there's no basis in the text of the Constitution for exempting press in the sense of, what, the Fifth Estate?",
  "I -- I'm a little disoriented here, Mr. Stewart. We are dealing with a constitutional provision, are we not, the one that I remember which says Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of the press? That's what we're interpreting here?",
  "Okay.",
  "Mr. Stewart, do you think that there's a possibility that the First Amendment interest is greater when what the government is trying to stifle is not just a speaker who wants to say something but also a hearer who wants to hear what the speaker has to say? I mean what is somewhat different about this case is that unlike over-the-air television you have a situation where you only get this -- this message would only air -- if somebody elects to hear it. So you really have two interested people, the speaker and the listener who wants to -- who wants to get this. Isn't that a somewhat heightened First Amendment interest than just over-the-air broadcasting of advertising which probably most listeners don't want to hear?",
  "You are talking about effectiveness. That wasn't my point. My point was the -- the seriousness of the First Amendment interest that's being impinged where -- where you have both somebody who wants to speak and someone who affirmatively wants to hear what he has to say, and the government says, no, the two of you can't do this.",
  "Don't you think that's somewhat worse than the government just saying to somebody who wants to speak, no, you can't speak?",
  "I am not saying will - - will want. I mean you have a situation here where you don't get it unless you take the initiative to subscribe. I'm not -- I'm not trying to figure out person by person who wants to hear it and who doesn't. Here you have a medium in which somebody listens only if that person wants to listen. So the -- the person speaking wants to speak, and the person hearing wants to hear. It seems to me that's a stronger -- a stronger First Amendment interest.",
  "Good answer.",
  "So therefore one could say that that point wasn't decided in the case, right?",
  "What do you mean, \"they must\"? Do you think it's unconstitutional to deprive them of that?",
  "That's what you mean by \"they must have\"?",
  "That's fine, but -- but is it unconstitutional for Congress to say military courts are different, they've always been different, the need for finality is greater there, and we're conducting a different rule for there?",
  "Oh, oh, oh, so it would be unconstitutional if they did not leave in its place an adequate and effective substitute - -",
  "-- which would cover every situation no matter how fanciful, right?",
  "Did -- did coram nobis relief -- you say it has to be there. Was it ever used before in the military courts?",
  "Indeed, yes.",
  "Worse still. My goodness. So you were - -",
  "-- convicted by a court-martial and had no basis for -- for getting that revised, and that -- that lasted for a couple of hundred years, right? And that was okay or it wasn't okay?",
  "Well, that's fine. I mean, you can patch it up and say that they thought it wasn't a good idea to have just military courts. But it's very hard to make the constitutional argument you're making when for a couple hundred years in military, in military courts, which are different, there -- there was no relief at all.",
  "And you were saying it is. Just say, no, it's not constitutionally compelled and I'll be happy.",
  "I don't think it's much of a lurk when for 200 years this was going on. It's not lurking to my mind.",
  "Was that person retried, do you know?",
  "Was he still in the military?",
  "It's talking about somebody still within the military, if I -- if I heard the quote correctly, right?",
  "Mr. Shah, could you tell us what the government's position is on whether, when somebody has been discharged from the service and then a conviction which he -- which he suffered while he was in the service is set aside, can he be retried in military courts?",
  "Well, there is a distinction between jurisdiction and whether the action taken by the bankruptcy court comes within the statute. But at some point, at some point surely the two overlap. I mean, suppose -- you know, you say simply because it is a bankruptcy action it comes within the bankruptcy clause and there is jurisdiction. But what if the bankruptcy court in connection with the bankruptcy decrees that a totally unrelated company has to pay a certain amount of money and it's conceded that this company has no relation to the bankruptcy, but the court says, this is a national problem and this other company ought to contribute.",
  "Do you think that would be within the bankruptcy power?",
  "They can do anything under the bankruptcy law?",
  "Okay, that's fine. I'm not arguing about that. I'm arguing about the principle that you are asking us to accept, to wit, that this challenge cannot possibly be based upon jurisdiction. Surely there are some things that simply do not fall within the bankruptcy power. Isn't that true?",
  "Okay. And that - -",
  "Well, what you are saying is this does fall within the bankruptcy power. But don't tell us that it is not a challenge based upon the jurisdiction of the court and based exclusively upon the statute. It could be based upon both.",
  "But you acknowledge that that's not true. You acknowledge that they couldn't have issued the hypothetical order that the Chief Justice proposed, even if that was necessary, even if Travelers said, we will not kick in the money up to the limits of our liability unless you make us immune from all traffic accidents. You acknowledged that that's no good, right?",
  "Excuse me. That -- that statement may be wrong depending upon how you read Price Waterhouse, might it not? The first statement, that we've never imposed such a requirement. I mean, if you think Justice O'Connor's opinion was the determinative opinion in Price Waterhouse, then -- then we had.",
  "It was dictum. They may have been wrong.",
  "Could -- before you sit down, I -- I have been trying to figure out Justice White's opinion in Price Waterhouse. I mean, indeed he -- he voted to -- to remand the case, as did -- as did the four in the plurality, but for a very different reason. They remanded because -- \"We reverse the court of appeals' judgment against Price Waterhouse because the courts below erred by deciding that the defendant must make\" the proof of he would have been fired anyway by clear and convincing evidence. That -- that was the basis for their reversing and remanding. That was not Justice White's, because -- he said \"because the court of appeals required Price Waterhouse to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have reached the same\" -- \"in the absence of the improper motive. Rather than merely requiring proof by a preponderance of the evidence, I concur in the judgment reversing this case in part and remanding. With respect to the employer's burden, however, the plurality seems to require that the employer submit objective evidence.\" And he disagreed with that.",
  "Yes, but you -- you want us to ignore the -- the State tax. Do you really want us to do that? I mean, it would be the easiest thing in the world for the State of Alaska, instead of imposing it at the State level, to authorize the municipality to do it. I don't want this case to come back here for a second time.",
  "Now -- now that the municipality is imposing the taxes that the State used to impose, don't you think you have to count both of them?",
  "You are going to get a fragile judgment if -- if we go on those grounds. All it takes is a modification of the -- of the legislation.",
  "Including a -- a cruise ship is covered. I - -",
  "Was your answer to the Chief Justice that if there is a tonnage tax imposed on everything including -- including ships, it would still violate the Tonnage Clause. Is that right?",
  "It's my -- it's my hypothetical. I made it up.",
  "Do you think it would be okay?",
  "It's only discrimination that counts?",
  "Well, there's some - - there's some fight about that, obviously. There - - there is no fight about the fact that this tax is based upon how long the ship remains in port, right?",
  "Right. How many days it remains in port.",
  "Which means, the argument could go that this is obviously a -- a tax for the use of the port. And that's exactly what the Tonnage Clause was directed against, preventing Philadelphia and New York from taxing the consumers in New Jersey by imposing taxes on ships that bring in goods.",
  "But you don't think a daily -- a daily charge on vessels for remaining in port violates the Tonnage Clause?",
  "Is this anything else than that?",
  "Not felt by the other States, felt by the consumers in other States. Ultimately, it's not going to be the oil companies that pay this tax; it's going to be purchasers of oil.",
  "All of whom are going to be outside of Alaska, since this oil is leaving Alaska, right?",
  "It's a neat tax, you know, get somebody else to pay your taxes.",
  "Not fishing ships, right?",
  "None of -- none of Valdez's fishermen have to pay this tax at all?",
  "And nonmobile homes are not taxed as real property?",
  "So was all other personal property exempt from taxation, they didn't have a personal property tax, right?",
  "That's nicely targeted as well. But there is no constitutional impediment to targeting the people of New Jersey through taxing the oil equipment.",
  "But you can't -- you can't make vessels bear the overall burden of municipal governance. You can make them bear the burden of the services provided to them in harbor. But you cannot make them the instrument of funding all other municipal services. That's what the Tonnage Clause means.",
  "You are counting the state tax as well, right?",
  "You are counting the state tax on oil equipment?",
  "Wait a minute, owed to the State for what? What would be owed to the state? It's still a State tax and they are the collection agent, and it's a -- a credit against what they owe for their collections, right?",
  "What -- what's it a credit against? I don't understand what it's a credit against.",
  "What does the city get a credit against?",
  "-- as referred to in the - -",
  "Oh, I thought it was the city that got the credit - -",
  "Which is -- for a commercial vessel, is a rough calculation of how much it's worth.",
  "The more cargo you can carry, the more valuable the commercial ship.",
  "It offended them aesthetically?",
  "So all the State has to say is we are not -- we're not taxing you qua vessel.",
  "I mean, what - -",
  "Mr. Olson - -",
  "-- let me ask you something about -- about discrimination. Let's assume that I think it is relevant whether the tax is a discriminatory tax, property tax just levied on -- on ships or not. If that is my position, why should I count as establishing nondiscrimination the fact that Alaska or Valdez is also taxing -- most of its other property tax revenue comes from taxing oil equipment, right? And the burden of all of that tax, just like the burden of this vessel tax, is paid by people in New Jersey. I mean, you know, that - -",
  "It's getting somebody else to bear the burden of your taxation.",
  "Taxing that equipment raises the price of oil, almost all of which the oil goes out of Alaska and is paid for by people in other states. Why should I count that property tax as proving that either the State of Alaska or Valdez is not being discriminatory? Just because it -- it can't possibly violate the -- the Tonnage Clause doesn't mean that it isn't as much discriminatory against other states.",
  "No, I - -",
  "And if -- if California taxed vessels, I would not allow California to come in and say, oh, we are just subjecting them to the same tax that our own citizens are subjected to.",
  "I wouldn't let them point to the Silicon Valley tax.",
  "If that's all it applied to, then the wharfage tax would have been perfectly okay. You can't say that was - -",
  "I also gather that the ability of the President or the United States to seek some compensation from Iraq through diplomatic channels on behalf of these plaintiffs is not affected at all by this outcome, right?",
  "It's a long section. Which part of the section - -",
  "Why -- why does it say then any other provision of law? You know, Congress could have explained its more narrow purpose in a few words.",
  "Oh - -",
  "Who's paying for these shipments? I mean, is that a real problem when there is nobody over there to pay for them? You are worried about -- about armaments producers shipping -- shipping goods when there is nobody who has ordered them and is going to pay for them? I mean, that's absurd.",
  "Well, no. I mean, it's also a debate as to whether the call on that question should be a Federal one or a State one, whether -- there are all sorts of conditions attached to the -- the suits that are allowed under 620A. And you are saying that, even without those conditions, any State -- Oklahoma - - can decide Americans can -- can sue foreign countries.",
  "I know, but we have been talking about it - -",
  "-- for a couple of minutes, so we - -",
  "I didn't start this.",
  "I think -- I think what they say is that the designation remains in effect. I don't think they say that the power to undesignate disappears.",
  "I'd be -- well, I'll ask them, but I'd be surprised if it's - -",
  "You want to clarify this last part - -",
  "-- we have just been discussing?",
  "I thought you'd say that.",
  "Excuse me. I am not following this exchange because I don't understand whether the -- the statewide percentage is the statewide percentage of English learners or the statewide percentage of all students.",
  "If you can't answer that, I think Justice Breyer can. But I would like to know what comparison - -",
  "I don't. That's -- that's exactly true. But - -",
  "I assume it's - -",
  "I also assume the State law does not require that any -- any judicial decree with respect to a particular district be expanded to the whole State. It seems to me you could comply with the State Constitution. If and when a judgment is rendered as to the district, it would then be, under the State Constitution, the responsibility of the State executive to make sure that the other -- other districts are equalized. But why the attorney general had to come into the Federal court and say, do it to the whole State, because the whole State has to be equal, I -- I can't understand that, to tell you the truth.",
  "The fact is he wanted to be thrown into the briar patch, didn't he?",
  "The State attorney general wanted the decree.",
  "Yes, but didn't -- didn't the court -- you say plan A is no longer in effect; they have a new plan under the No Child Left Behind Act. But didn't the -- didn't the district court find that the funding for that plan is inadequate, for the two reasons that were mentioned earlier?",
  "Well, I -- I agree with that. I think it was a vast mistake to extend a lawsuit that applied only to Nogales to the whole State, but the State attorney general wanted that done.",
  "But that's -- that's water over the dam. That's not what this suit is about now.",
  "Which would be good enough to fix Nogales. So you are quite right. There is a vast difference in each district. But that attorney general wanted enough money to fund the whole State the way you have to fund to -- to fix Nogales. That's what he wanted.",
  "Can I ask whether the requirements of the EEOA are at all affected by Congress's later enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act? I mean, you know, it's a very vague requirement that you make a good faith effort to -- to provide language assistance to children. Why shouldn't the courts decide that what constitutes a good faith effort is pretty much what Congress thought was necessary in the -- in the No Child Left Behind Act, and if you comply with that, you are doing okay?",
  "Okay. I would call that good faith, but that's fine.",
  "That's fine.",
  "What -- what page is this?",
  "What degree - -",
  "What degree of improvement do you think is necessary? Do you agree with the Ninth -- the Ninth Circuit says, \"We cannot say the district court clearly erred when it found this burden was not met. A district in which the majority of ELL tenth graders failed to meet State achievement standards while the majority of native English speakers passed is not one whose performance demonstrates that the State is adequately funding ELL programs.\" Do you really think that you haven't complied with adequate funding of ELL programs until you raise all of the ELL students up to the level of native English speakers?",
  "Well, that's all this says. The majority doesn't - -",
  "-- doesn't meet the -- a majority of ELL tenth graders fail to meet the standards, but the majority of native English speakers do.",
  "Counsel, I - -",
  "I find it bizarre that we are sitting here talking about what the whole State has to do on the basis of one district which is concededly the district that has the most nonnative English speakers and has been a problem district all along. And we are saying whatever this district court says for - - for this school district applies statewide. Now, that is bizarre.",
  "And the mere fact that the State Attorney General acquiesced in that kind -- kind of a system at the outset, does that force us to still accept at this time that whatever is -- is necessary for Nogales is also necessary for the entire State?",
  "I'll let - -",
  "I'll let Arizona worry about that. It's -- it's another matter to have a district court decree that the whole State has to do this thing. And whether -- whether it's done equally or not would be a matter for the State courts to determine, instead of for this district judge to determine, right?",
  "Right but - -",
  "I understand that. You could get the plan approved and then not fund it. But at least the additional funding demanded by the district court should be whatever additional funding is necessary to comply with the No Child Left Behind Act. Right?",
  "Well, then -- then it's not as simple as you made it. Of course, I agree with the fact that if you get approved under the No Child Left Behind Act and then don't fund it, of course that - - that won't satisfy your obligation. But if you have gotten approved, the test for whether you are satisfying your obligation should be how much money would it cost to implement the program that you have gotten approved under the No Child Left Behind Act.",
  "It doesn't approve programs?",
  "I thought the States had to submit a program.",
  "Right. Right.",
  "So you are saying you can't calculate costs.",
  "You cannot calculate costs under the plan approved by the Secretary - -",
  "-- because all the plan is is testing.",
  "Okay.",
  "Ms. Saharsky, I have one late arriving question. Do you think that the constitutional -- State constitutional provision at least there has to be equivalent funding in districts, do you think that would be called into play if the Federal Government under a federal program gave additional funds to a particular district? Which I am sure it does, those districts that have federal facilities probably get additional -- additional money, would all the rest -- under this constitutional provision, would all the rest of the State have to belly up to that -- to that same level?",
  "I doubt it.",
  "Yeah.",
  "Well, if federal funding doesn't count, why would a federal decree applicable only to a particular school district count?",
  "It is no content to the equal child -- No Child Left Behind. There is no content to it. All it requires is testing.",
  "You can't say how much it's going to cost.",
  "But I -- I think you're really caught in -- in a dilemma here. Your answer suggests that you would not have allowed a cavity search in this case.",
  "But people have been known to secrete contraband in -- in bodily cavities. What is the -- what is the principle under which you would allow a strip search but disallow a cavity search?",
  "Had it been - -",
  "Had it been the case that, as I recall, someone had -- well, students were popping ibuprofen, weren't they?",
  "I guess they might pop aspirin as well. I'm not aware that one gets a high on either one of those. Somebody in -- in the school had gotten almost fatally ill about a year before this incident; isn't that right?",
  "On over-the-counter drugs.",
  "A prescription, not over - the-counter.",
  "Did the school know what - - what particular pills it was searching for?",
  "Did it know that -- what - - what the threat was was ibuprofen or aspirin or -- or some prescription drug?",
  "How did he know it was an OTC pill?",
  "Just by looking at it?",
  "Okay.",
  "What was in it? Did he say --",
  "Any contraband, like the black marker pencil that -- that astounded me. That was contraband in that school, wasn't it, a black marker pencil?",
  "Oh, is that what they do?",
  "They sniff them?",
  "Really?",
  "Could I come back to your distinguishing a strip search from a cavity search. What would you require before you would allow a cavity search?",
  "No cavity search in school, no matter what?",
  "I assume a school can assign a student to study hall. That's not considered a government seizure. Isn't that an obvious part of the parental supervision that a school exercises, sit here and stay there.",
  "Schools do that all the time, don't they?",
  "Well, I suppose you could say that about any strip search, couldn't you: That there is never a need for a strip search? You could always give the -- you know, the suspected felon, you know: Here, change into this suit. And -- and we haven't adopted some such rule, have we?",
  "Well, one of the defendants doesn't have qualified immunity.",
  "So don't we have to, for that defendant at least, decide the constitutional question?",
  "You -- you have to, under your standard, have reason -- a reasonable suspicion specifically that -- that the student is hiding the contraband in the student's underwear?",
  "Now, if -- if you have a reasonable suspicion that the student has drugs and you search every other place, you search in the student's pack, you search the student's outer garments, and you have a reasonable suspicion that the student has drugs, don't you have, after conducting all these other searches, a reasonable suspicion that she has drugs in her underpants?",
  "All right.",
  "Your logic fails me.",
  "You -- you reasonably suspect the student has drugs. You've searched everywhere else. By God, the drugs must be in her underpants.",
  "Excuse me. That wouldn't -- that wouldn't satisfy the test you've just given us. I thought you said there had to be specific indication that she was carrying it in her undergarments. And what Justice Alito posed was not that, just specific indication that she had it on her person. Is that enough? Do you want to revise your test so it's not just specific indication that it's in her undergarments, but specific indication that it's on her person? That's enough?",
  "So there is a sliding scale for the dangerousness of what you're looking for?",
  "You're saying the whole search, not just the search of the undergarments. You're saying they couldn't even have searched her backpack, right?",
  "Why?",
  "So you want a sliding scale?",
  "As -- as I understand your - your presentation, you qualify as a strip search any search that requires the outer garments to be taken off. So it didn't really matter whether they required her to shake out her bra or stretch the elastic of her underwear?",
  "But is a strip search and -- impermissible along the lines you say, to require the student to even take off the outer garments?",
  "The police would require - -",
  "The police would require probable cause, wouldn't they, not just suspicion?",
  "Is probable cause a jury question too?",
  "Yes, probable cause in the ordinary criminal investigation cases. Is that a jury question?",
  "I don't think it's a question. You can -- even -- even in a 1983 action, I don't think the courts allow a jury to decide whether there was probable cause for an officer's search or seizure. That's new to me.",
  "Unless the people feel differently.",
  "Some school districts have rules against - -",
  "-- simply forbidding strip searches on any -- right?",
  "So that's the question, whether that's enough or whether the government's power to prevent discovery, which it can do, is that alone enough?",
  "I understand that. But - - but I'm saying there are various steps the governments -- the government can take, and I -- I think you have a point, that even though this case may be an easy one, we're going to have to decide in future cases how much -- how much activity by the government is enough activity to make the government a party.",
  "And if it turns out the government is not going to come in, you can always dismiss the appeal.",
  "Well, anyway, a rule's a rule and discussing all of these consequences is beside the point. If, indeed, the government's a party, it's 60 days, right, and you say the government's a party?",
  "And is -- is it your position that the government is a party to this case for all purposes, for all purposes of all the rules, or is it just some of them?",
  "As opposed to the government's view, which does sort of pick and choose between - -",
  "Well, your argument goes - - is replying to the government the Respondent's argument that there is no sense in giving 60 days to the government, and what you're saying is, yes, sometimes there is.",
  "Even when the government has not actively participated. So it really negates, you know, you're doing something that has no point. It could have a point, to give the government 60 days, even in a case where it has not actively participated. It may need that long to consult with other agencies as to whether to accept a defeat in this case or -- or on its own to conduct an appeal if the relator doesn't want to.",
  "I'm sure the government will agree with that. I'm sure that's one of the contexts in which they agree that the government is a party.",
  "But there are some provisions that -- that seem to indicate the government isn't a party. For example, it specifically provides that even when the government hasn't intervened, the government may request copies of the pleadings. Doesn't it have to make requests for them?",
  "Well, why would it have to do that if it's a party?",
  "So you're -- I mean, you're saying they are not a party for that rule at least, that requires the pleadings to be served upon the other party.",
  "Right.",
  "I'm not following you. I'm saying if -- if the government is a party, Rule 5 would apply and the government would automatically get copies of the pleading whether or not it requested them. So the provision in the False Claims Act that the government will only get copies if it requests them seems to indicate that the government is not a party.",
  "Can I come back to the Rule 5 point just for a minute? You say that the effect of the False Claims Act is simply to restrict what would normally be the right of the government to get copies of all the pleadings. That's really not how it reads. It doesn't say that the government shall receive copies of the pleadings only if it requests them. It says the government shall receive copies of the pleadings if it requests them, as though without that provision it wouldn't have a right to receive copies. Isn't that the way it reads?",
  "Well, that's what we are down here, you know.",
  "Precision.",
  "May be for other purposes? I thought you told me before that it was for other purposes as well.",
  "Okay. Let's stay on track.",
  "Where is that? What provision is that? I didn't focus on that.",
  "Yes. I am sorry. I didn't mean to eat up your time with this.",
  "I mean, where is it in the stuff that I have?",
  "Yes, but that doesn't say anything about discovery in particular. I thought you were talking about some declination provision that - - that said the government is -- is not subject to discovery.",
  "And -- and the fact that it cannot conduct discovery also involves the fact that it's immune from discovery, how do you get that? And it is; is it not?",
  "Oh, I'm sure it's the government's position.",
  "But how can that -- how can that be if it's a party?",
  "The declination provision doesn't say that. The declination provision just says that it is not actively conducting the case. But how do you get its exemption from discovery?",
  "I agree with that, but - - but it's -- it's for me a problem with your assertion that for all purposes the government is a party. It seems to me it is not a party for purposes of discovery, and there is no provision in -- in the -- in the False Claims Act that exempts it from discovery.",
  "Except that the government here has considerable powers even without intervening, and they include its ability to move to stay discovery, which normally a party would only be able to do. It can object to any voluntary dismissal or settlement, which normally would be a party's right.",
  "And some courts have allowed the government to move to dismiss.",
  "So unlike -- unlike your adversary here, you -- your adversary says the government is a party for all purposes; you are not saying the government is not a party for all purposes. You're saying it's not a party for some purposes?",
  "You are saying that.",
  "But you're also saying as for the rest, sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't.",
  "You rely a lot, counsel, on -- on intervention, as that's what makes the government a party.",
  "Right?",
  "The original statute or the earlier statute did not use the word \"intervention.\"",
  "I forget the different word it used?",
  "Appearance?",
  "Well, I really wonder whether they didn't intend the same -- the same result. If you think they consciously -- under the prior statute, you would say the government - -",
  "The government would have been a party?",
  "Because you can be a party and not appear.",
  "The other side acknowledges that. They say, however, it's different when you have real party in interest plus the party named - -",
  "-- and these things are styled \"United States.\"",
  "No, no, no. No, no, that's -- that's unfair. If you are a real party in interest and you are the named party - -",
  "You're normally a party.",
  "Except the United States has a lot of power. Unlike the -- the government's presentation here, you would not allow any degree of activity on the part of the government to cause it to be a party, even if it exercises all these other powers short of intervening? It must intervene in your - -",
  "Well, do you want a bright line or not a bright line?",
  "Do you agree with the government?",
  "Do you agree with the government's presentation that it becomes a party when it reaches a certain ineffable degree of activity in the case?",
  "I don't think they were relying on Devlin. The - -",
  "The point they are making here - -",
  "--- is not that we're a party for some purposes and not for others. The point they're making is we're a party for all purposes, once we reach a certain degree of activity in the case.",
  "I think they were.",
  "We disagree on that.",
  "We'll hear from them.",
  "I have a question for you, Mr. Wall.",
  "What is the government's position on that point?",
  "Doesn't it need the 60 days to figure out whether it would want to intervene in order to be able to appeal?",
  "But they are not statutes which give the government an extended period of time in order to allow the consultation. This is a statute that does that. And why would they -- why would they not envision the need for that consultation in the situation where the government has had no participation but comes up with a -- with a decision contrary to what it thinks the good law is, and it has to decide whether it wants to intervene in order to appeal. Why shouldn't they be given 60 days?",
  "But it is -- it is a potential appellant. I mean if you say Congress is concerned about situations in which the government is a potential appellant. It is a potential appellant in these cases until the 30 days have elapsed, at least. It -- it can intervene, and why shouldn't it have the 60 days to decide whether to appeal or not?",
  "I understand, but this - - this goes to your argument about congressional intent: That they were concerned about preserving to the government time as a potential appellant to think the matter over. It seems to me that argument is -- is a wash.",
  "Can the United States intervene within those 30 days - -",
  "-- and then appeal?",
  "I think it's a potential appellant.",
  "That's -- that's true, but that's not the point that Justice Souter was making. This is a self-denying position on the part of the government. You would expect the government to come in and say, yeah, give us 60 days to think this over. They're saying, no, we'll only take 30, because they're worried if we come out your way on that issue, there are other issues on which they're also going to be considered a party, and it's not worth the risk.",
  "They would not have discriminated against any particular - -",
  "-- white or -- or majority applicants in -- in that selection, which is what occurred here. You had -- you had some applicants who were winners, and their -- their promotion was -- was set aside. That doesn't exist in these hypotheticals at all. It's just an abstract question of which of these two systems should be adopted.",
  "What -- one of the briefs said that, and maybe it wasn't done below, but one of the briefs said part of the claim is that some of the things that this test tested for were not -- were not qualities or abilities that were needed in New Haven, although they might be needed in other fire departments. The test had not been localized. Wasn't that part of the -- part of the objection?",
  "Can I hear his answer to this one first? I'm getting confused.",
  "They are at war with one another.",
  "How can one avoid - -",
  "If it looks like or if the employer just in good faith believes?",
  "When I say they're at war with one another, I mean they become at war with one another when you say that all that is necessary to permit intentional discrimination is the employer's good faith belief that if he didn't intentionally discriminate, he'd be caught in a situation of disparate impact.",
  "At that point, they're at war with each other.",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "And a reasonable response to that, is your position?",
  "Not just in response to that.",
  "A reasonable - -",
  "And you would say that - - and I'm asking the same question the Chief Justice asked earlier -- you would say that if it had come out the other way - -",
  "And if there had been a disproportionate number of minorities who -- who passed the test - -",
  "You would say that it's neutral to set that test aside?",
  "I don't think you'd say that.",
  "It's whether it is -- it is neutral to set aside a test simply because one race predominates.",
  "How you can call that race-neutral I -- I do not know.",
  "Isn't that a controverted issue of fact? How can you possibly get around that?",
  "I mean, one side says what you say is just pretext; the real reason was just politics. Isn't that an issue of fact that has to be tried?",
  "I don't see how you can call it facially neutral. It's neutral because you throw it out for the losers as well as for the winners? That's neutrality?",
  "Of course you're not saying that -- that the test is -- is compliance. You're - - you're saying the belief that it's necessary for compliance is a compelling State interest.",
  "I mean everybody would probably concede that if -- if continuing would clearly be in violation, of course, it's a compelling interest. But the issue here is: Is it enough if the employer simply worries that if he doesn't make the change, he may be in violation?",
  "What -- what's the line there?",
  "You acknowledge strong basis in evidence is -- is what -- what the city has to have?",
  "Right.",
  "I thought you just said that. I just thought you just -- I was -- almost wrote it down.",
  "Absolutely positively?",
  "Mr. Moseley - -",
  "I don't -- I don't understand how you squeeze your -- your modified categorical approach, which seems to be a deus ex machina which is intended to blunt the government's argument that very few statutes would be covered by this. I don't see how you get that out of the word \"convicted.\" Are you convicted of an offense involving more than $10,000 if in a separate interrogatory the jury, though it has no obligation in order to find you guilty to say how much you stole, in an interrogatory the jury says, oh, yes, the amount was more than $10,000? Does that cause you to have been convicted of that? You are convicted of what you are charged with. You are convicted of the elements of the offense, not - - not of whatever, whatever the judge chooses to allow the jury to be questioned about.",
  "-- your earlier -- your earlier assertion that it was necessary to -- that - - that it would be necessary to get that -- that amount specified for sentencing purposes is simply not true. I mean, we didn't -- we didn't hold that the guidelines are mandatory, and you -- that you need a -- a jury determination. We've said they are discretionary.",
  "So if you don't have a jury determination, you can still sentence on the basis of the amount taken, even though that was not found by the jury.",
  "I hope in rebuttal you'll address the argument about deferring to the agency's finding about what it means. We usually do that.",
  "You can save it for rebuttal.",
  "Well, except -- except for his modified hangout. His modified -- his modified categorical does -- does expand; doesn't it?",
  "And also interrogatories to the jury.",
  "You -- you wouldn't allow that exclusion to have any effect on deportation, would you?",
  "I'm not -- I -- I'm losing you. I would -- I would have thought that you have to have convicted him of the larger scheme.",
  "Oh, I didn't - -",
  "Well, I would -- I thought that was the whole case we had before us, Where you haven't proved either as an element or -- or by a separate jury finding how much money was involved. Your point is you don't have to.",
  "You can establish that later.",
  "I -- I would have thought you would not accept the Chief Justice's premise, that a crime of violence is an aggravated felony.",
  "It isn't.",
  "It depends on how you read the language. I guess -- I guess grammatically it could be read either way. You can read it: an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which -- in which the loss to the victim exceeds $10,000. Or you could read it: convicted of an offense that involves fraud or deceit, in which the loss to the victim exceeds $10,000. I mean, \"convicted\" doesn't necessarily apply to the last -- to the last phrase.",
  "-- and that's basically what we're arguing about.",
  "To come back to the deference point, you say -- is this relevant to the criminal conviction? He's convicted criminally regardless of how you read that. You acknowledge it doesn't -- it isn't an element of the crime, and so to be convicted criminally you acknowledge you don't have to show the amount - -",
  "-- right?",
  "Well, in that later criminal proceeding, they would have to prove it undoubtedly - -",
  "But this is not a later criminal proceeding; this is an administrative proceeding. And why shouldn't it be up to the BIA initially to determine how to interpret this language for purposes of the deportation laws?",
  "But there -- was it not true that there the interpretation placed upon the statute by BIA would also be the interpretation necessary to secure the criminal conviction? And that's not the case here.",
  "Of course, (ii) through (iv) don't -- don't limit or contradict any explicit requirement of (i).",
  "(i) is only at most a negative implication, which -- which one would not draw in light of (ii) through (iv), is what you're saying.",
  "Of course, the parents here didn't -- didn't run off to a private school only after the school district had found that their child didn't require any special education, did they?",
  "They -- they put him in a private school without even consulting the schools.",
  "Saying by the way, we can get some money. How much -- how much money are you talking about imposing on the school district here?",
  "A month?",
  "Maybe -- I'm sorry.",
  "This school does not have to come up with an IEP. It could tough it out and say, we're going to rest on our belief that this child does not need any special education, right? And unless the school proposes an IEP, the parent cannot come within subsection (2) by sending the kid to get the special services.",
  "Could the district appeal? That's the end of the road? Can't the district say the hearing officer is wrong?",
  "And if it does, does it have to take any action in the interim.",
  "Which is - -",
  "Would you be surprised to find a court decision which says that when the reason that the plaintiff cannot comply with the requirement that he first be in a plan, when the reason is -- is the district's refusal to abide by an order to prepare a plan, that subsection (2) does not apply?",
  "You can't profit by your own malfeasance.",
  "But you -- you don't think -- you don't think a court could say the only reason these people could not comply with (ii) is that the school district made it impossible by not complying with the order to provide an IEP; and, therefore, they - - they can recover for the private placement?",
  "I think it's more than conceivable. I know a lot of courts that would hold that.",
  "Except that you are reading (C)(i) to say something that it doesn't say. It just says you don't have to pay if the agency has made a free appropriate public education available.",
  "And you read it to say you must pay whenever it hasn't made, and it just doesn't say that. It -- it's a safe harbor for the school district. It says, so long as you've made an appropriate public education available, you can't be liable for any -- any private school tuition. Now, you want to expand that to say, and whenever that condition doesn't exist, you are liable. But it really doesn't say that. And -- and the later sections suggest that it meant not to say that.",
  "Yes, but if -- if you avoid that collaborative relationship entirely and just run off to a prior -- to a private school right away, you get reimbursement. Why?",
  "Why would Congress -- huh?",
  "I'm not following this. I don't know what section.",
  "Are any of these other procedures -- I took these to be procedures that have to be provided by the school district, not -- not by the hearing officer.",
  "But it doesn't say hearing officers. \"An opportunity to present complaints with respect to any matter relating to the identification\" - -",
  "-- to present the complaint to the principal.",
  "And it might make also sense to say that if the hearing officer has no authority to award a certain type of relief, neither does a court, under that general provision that - -",
  "That's right, but -- but with these new provisions, if the hearing officer doesn't have the authority to award the kind of relief that was awarded here, then the court wouldn't either.",
  "Well, you agree they go, as we say, in pari passu - -",
  "-- that -- that whatever the hearing officer can do, the court can do.",
  "-- and whatever he can't do, the court can't do.",
  "(i)(2)(B)(iii) - -",
  "(i)(2)(B)(iii)?",
  "It's now (C)?",
  "(C)(iii).",
  "Let me be clear. Am I correct that under -- under the theory of the statute that you are supporting, it would be possible for a parent, without first consulting with the school at all, to put the child in a private school and then later to request public school services, and when it is -- when they are denied or they are inadequate, all that public school -- private school tuition would be reimbursable?",
  "Excuse me. The same rule would not apply in Michigan and Hawaii, anyway, even under the Federal Government. The Federal Government acknowledges that Michigan can have its own law - -",
  "-- and Hawaii can have a different law. All the Federal Government is arguing is: We want to be the ones to enforce the separate Michigan law and the separate Hawaii law, right?",
  "You don't deny, do you, that the Federal Government can, if it wishes, enforce the State laws?",
  "So this provision isn't really contrary to what you are saying. You are just saying the State can do it as well?",
  "I thought that was your position, that the -- that the visitation authority includes the power to enforce general laws.",
  "Of the sovereign. But that a separate action to enforce the laws of the sovereign does not necessarily mean that visitorial powers are being exercised.",
  "So there would be no inconsistency, if you believe that.",
  "Well, wait a minute. I - - this is state law. And if the State supreme court has said that the statute means a certain thing and that certain thing is a little bit different from what the Federal antidiscrimination law is, I assume that the Federal Government in applying State law has to -- has to take that difference into account, doesn't it?",
  "The Federal Government doesn't -- doesn't have the right to alter State law.",
  "I don't see any difference whatever in that regard between using the active and passive.",
  "Well, that's not State law applying of its own force, just as your second example was not State law applying of its own force. It was State law that had been converted into Federal law by the Federal Government's adoption of it.",
  "That's a different situation.",
  "You are arguing for conflict pre-emption. I mean that's a -- that's a different issue than, say, that the -- the State law shouldn't apply. But don't tell me the State law applies, but only the Federal Government is -- what incentive does the Federal Government have to enforce State law?",
  "It -- it has so much spare time after enforcing Federal law that it's -- it's going to be worrying about State law?",
  "That's conflict pre-emption, and that goes to the -- to the law. You shouldn't have a separate State law that -- that provides a separate standard that conflicts with the Federal standard. So you pre-empt the law. You don't say the law is in effect, but the State can't enforce it. That's a weird way to solve that problem.",
  "Sure, there is.",
  "Would -- would you acknowledge, counsel, that there is a difference between enforcing State laws through visitation and enforcing State laws apart from visitation? And what Waters involved was enforcing State laws through visitation. Of course, you can do that through -- through visitation powers, but you can also do apart from that by bringing a lawsuit or whatever.",
  "I'm sorry, did I skip over an axis here.",
  "I didn't mean to.",
  "Ms. Underwood, I -- I forgot the response you made in your brief. I know you did make some response to subsection (b) of section 484. How do you -- how do you explain that?",
  "Yes. Why -- why do they list those exceptions, unless one would think that everything is covered?",
  "I suppose if -- if enforcement pre-emption is the lesser step, we probably ought to revise our jurisprudence so as not to tread any more heavily than we have to upon the States so that where there is conflict pre-emption, all we should say is the State law is not invalidated, it is simply not enforceable?",
  "I mean that would - -",
  "Well, has preclearance been denied to you?",
  "But you're subject to preclearance and you cannot make changes without going to the Attorney General and asking for his permission.",
  "Is it any different from, from a -- a Federal law prohibiting certain speech? Do you have to subject yourself to the -- to the penalty for that speech before you can attack the law? I don't think so.",
  "No, the parallel -- the parallel isn't there. I mean, there are laws against intentional discrimination. So there should be laws against wiretapping. There should also be laws against intentional discrimination. But where the -- the argument here is not that those laws be eliminated. It's just that the preclearance requirements be eliminated.",
  "A long time ago. How much of the evidence that Congress amassed was specifically circumvention evidence?",
  "Not comparative, however. Not comparative with the rest of the country except in -- in - -",
  "Oh, let's talk about the bailout provision. That -- that was inserted in 1982.",
  "How many years is that? Over a quarter of a century, there have been 15 bailouts that have gone through? All of them in the State of Virginia?",
  "You bring this before us as a justification for the legislation.",
  "It's obviously quite impracticable - -",
  "-- for anybody to bail out.",
  "The question is whether it's right, not whether Congress rejected it.",
  "It fends off Section 2 suits, I assume. I mean, that's great. You get a declaratory judgment, here -- you know, a benediction, and you skip off without having to face suits. That may be one reason. Another reason may be that they like the packing of minorities and the other -- the other districting tricks that can be -- that can be pulled because - because of the requirements of the Voting Rights Act.",
  "Well, they get elected under this system. Why should that they take it away?",
  "I say, everybody who voted for this -- this system was elected under this system. Should it be surprising that they think it it's a good thing?",
  "We are not insisting that they -- the other side is not insisting that they be kicked out. If they want to voluntarily stay in, fine. In fact, you should let other States and other jurisdiction opt in if they want to.",
  "If you want to make this a voluntary system that's something entirely different, but the question is assuming a State or -- or a covered jurisdiction does not want to be in, do you have the right to coerce them to be in? That's all we are talking about.",
  "If they want to stay in, that's fine.",
  "That was 1980?",
  "The bailout provision was adopted in 1982, 27 years ago. There have been 15 bailouts since then. Is that what you think Congress contemplated when it enacted the bailout provision in 1982?",
  "Less than one a year?",
  "What I understand it, is this incorrect? As I understand it for Travis County to get a bailout, it would -- it has within Travis County something like 106 political subdivisions that are covered, and Travis County would have to go to all of those 106 and demonstrate that there has been no violation by any of those 106 for the preceding whatever it is, five years, whatever the bailout provision is. You think that's -- you think that's feasible?",
  "Travis County is not the superior of many of those subunits, as it is not of this district here. This district is a subdivision of the State, but not of Travis County.",
  "Mr. Adegbile, what was -- I read it in the briefs, and I forget what it was. What was the vote on this 2006 extension -- 98 to nothing in the Senate, and what was it in the House? Was - -",
  "33 to 390. You know, the -- the Israeli Supreme Court, the Sanhedrin, used to have a rule that if the death penalty was pronounced unanimously, it was invalid, because there must be something wrong there. Do you ever expect -- do you ever seriously expect Congress to vote against a reextension of the Voting Rights Act? Do you really think that any incumbent would -- would vote to do that?",
  "Twenty-five years from now? Fifty years from now? When?",
  "Thirty-three members of the House and nobody in the Senate.",
  "Wasn't Virginia the first State in the Union to elect a black governor.",
  "And it has a black chief justice of the supreme court currently.",
  "Do you think Congress could prevent foreign individuals from funding speech in United States elections?",
  "Private individuals, foreigners who -- who want to - -",
  "Well, it's not different. I asked it because I thought it was related to the question you were answering.",
  "It -- it covers totally - - totally owned corporations, too, doesn't it?",
  "I mean, if I owned all the stock in a corporation, the corporation still can't - -",
  "It didn't say it would come out differently. It just said, we're not deciding that case, right?",
  "I don't mind citing that. Bellotti didn't decide that.",
  "I -- I -- I thought that Buckley had narrowed the statute precisely to magic words and still found it unconstitutional as applied to corporations that made independent expenditures.",
  "Isn't that what happened in Buckley?",
  "And some of the plaintiffs were corporations.",
  "Don't keep us in suspense.",
  "There are -- there are two separate questions that -- that have been raised in opposition to your position. One is -- one is that we should not resolve a broad constitutional issue where there are narrower grounds, and that's the question you are responding to. An entirely separate question is the issue of stare decisis, and you acknowledge that stare decisis was not involved in New York Times v. Sullivan, but the first question obviously was.",
  "Wait, wait, wait, wait. We never questioned it, but we never approved it, either. And we gave some really weird interpretations to the Taft-Hartley Act in order to avoid confronting the question.",
  "I don't understand what you are saying. I mean, we are not a self -- self-starting institution here. We only disapprove of something when somebody asks us to. And if there was no occasion for us to approve or disapprove, it proves nothing whatever that we didn't disapprove it.",
  "Let's -- let's talk about overbreadth. You've -- let's assume that that is a valid interest. What percentage of the total number of corporations in the country are not single shareholder corporations? The local hairdresser, the local auto repair shop, the local new car dealer -- I don't know any small business in this country that isn't incorporated, and the vast majority of them are sole-shareholder-owned. Now this statute makes it unlawful for all of them to do the things that you are worried about, you know, distorting other -- the interests of other shareholders. That is vast overbreadth.",
  "I'm not talking about the corruption interest. You -- you have your quid pro quo argument, that's another one. We get to that when we get there. But as far as the interest you are now addressing, which is those shareholders who don't agree with this political position are being somehow cheated, that doesn't apply probably to the vast majority of corporations in this country.",
  "So that can't be the justification - -",
  "-- because if it were, the statute would be vastly overbroad.",
  "Congress has a self-interest. I mean, we -- we are suspicious of congressional action in the First Amendment area precisely because we -- at least I am -- I doubt that one can expect a body of incumbents to draw election restrictions that do not favor incumbents. Now is that excessively cynical of me? I don't think so.",
  "General Kagan, most -- most corporations are indistinguishable from the individual who owns them, the local hairdresser, the new auto dealer -- dealer who has just lost his dealership and - - and who wants to oppose whatever Congressman he thinks was responsible for this happening or whatever Congressman won't try to patch it up by -- by getting the auto company to undo it. There is no distinction between the individual interest and the corporate interest. And that is true for the vast majority of corporations.",
  "Yet this law freezes all of them out.",
  "Oh, he wants to put up a sign - -",
  "What happened to the overbreadth doctrine? I mean, I thought our doctrine in the Fourth Amendment is if you write it too broadly, we are not going to pare it back to the point where it's constitutional. If it's overbroad, it's invalid. What has happened to that.",
  "So you're -- you are a lawyer advising somebody who is about to come out with a book and you say don't worry, the FEC has never tried to send somebody to prison for this. This statute covers it, but don't worry, the FEC has never done it. Is that going to comfort your client? I don't think so.",
  "Great aggregations of wealth. The brief by the Chamber of Commerce, the amicus brief by the Chamber of Commerce points out that 96 percent of its members employ less than 100 people. These are not aggregations of great wealth. You are not talking about the railroad barons and the rapacious trusts of the Elihu Root era; you are talking mainly about small business corporations.",
  "I don't understand that answer. I mean, if that's what you were concerned about, what Elihu Root was concerned about, you could have said all corporations that have a net worth of more than, you know, so much or whatever. That is not what Congress did. It said all corporations.",
  "Mr. Allen, except for the fact that you and I are lawyers, do you really think that the -- that confidentiality right is any more important to the proper functioning of society than, let's say, the protection of trade secrets? So that in a case of discovery where the defendant says, if I produce this I would be giving up a trade secret and it's not necessary for the case, and the judge says no, turn it over -- would there be in your view a right to interlocutory appeal in that case? And if not there, then why here?",
  "The same thing with a trade secret. It is a suit between another company who is a competitor of yours - -",
  "And the Judge says, turn over your trade secret, the formula for Cocoa-Cola, and you say no. No interlocutory appeal, right?",
  "Or do you say there should be an interlocutory appeal there?",
  "Okay. Let's talk about predictability. Once you make an exception for waiver, there is already that limitation. It's not absolute. Maybe it can be waived. Secondly, you have to worry about a district court finding it to have been waived, even though it really wasn't. That's another point of doubt. And, thirdly, you have to worry about the Supreme Court affirming a district court that wrongly found it to have been waived because we give, you know, weight to the fact-finding of the -- of the district court. Once you -- once you factor in all of those uncertainties, you are not talking about a -- you know, about a fail-safe privilege at all. There are those doubts, and I'm not sure the doubts are increased enormously, by simply saying a district court may make a mistake without -- without your being able to go up to the court of appeals on that mistake.",
  "Why do you say the rule is three days? What rule is that?",
  "Yeah, but you -- you are not arguing for a seven-day limit no matter what, even if he is held in jail, are you?",
  "Right.",
  "Would it be a good idea to say that?",
  "I thought we liked clear lines in this. I mean, the police won't know what to do.",
  "You started to tell us why this case was important. Would you -- would you finish that? You said there were - -",
  "I -- I thought that you couldn't approach him. I thought that once he's invoked his right to counsel, you can't approach him and say, would you like to talk now? Right? Isn't that -- isn't that the rule?",
  "Well, if the incarceration is a continuation of custodial custody, to be redundant, if it is a continuation of the custody, then why wouldn't asking him whether he would like to see visitors who want to ask him about a particular crime, why wouldn't that be a violation of Edwards?",
  "I'm sure they would.",
  "So the -- the -- the scheme that Justice Stevens proposes wouldn't work. You would be violating Edwards when you asked him if he wanted to see interrogators.",
  "Or to the police who have to decide whether they can interrogate or not.",
  "It doesn't mean badgering.",
  "We ought to get another term for it then.",
  "Questioning?",
  "There was no attempt in this hypothetical to get him to change his mind. They didn't know he had made up his mind.",
  "Do -- do we have to ask him, you know, what visitors? I mean, is that the question?",
  "Do you want to have any visitors today?",
  "He says, I don't know. Is it my mother?",
  "Or -- or do you ask him, are you willing to speak to investigators about a crime? And he says what crime? I mean, how specific does - - does the request for permission to have visitors have to be?",
  "-- for this rule to cut in?",
  "Excuse me, what is the ethical rule about counsel? I thought if -- if there's counsel in a particular case and you want to approach the client about that case, you can't do it without going to counsel.",
  "But when there is an entirely different case, there is totally different litigation, you can't approach the fellow without going back to the counsel whom he hired for a different case? I don't think that's the ethical rule. But that's the effect of Edwards. Even if it's a different crime, you have to go back to the counsel whom he hired for a different prosecution? That bears no relationship to the ethical rules of -- of counsel.",
  "What if -- what if we limited Edwards to the same crime? That would -- that would really make it much easier form the police to - -",
  "-- to know whether this person in fact invoked the right to counsel.",
  "So that would - -",
  "Well, you are being very unrealistic. Have you ever known defense counsel who says, \"Oh, yes,\" to submit to the interrogation? I mean -- you know, once they are lawyered up, they are not going to talk. You know that.",
  "Doesn't -- but doesn't the beginning of the Miranda warning tell him that he doesn't have to - -",
  "Do I misunderstand Miranda warnings? Isn't he told, at the very outset of the Miranda warning, that he doesn't have to talk, if he doesn't want to talk? Is that -- is that any less strong than - - than asking him whether he wants to receive visitors, in general? Or, in particular, a visitor who wants to ask him about a particular crime? I mean, he is -- he is told that with the Miranda warning, which he is given the second time. If you don't want to talk, you don't have to. If you want a lawyer to be present, you are entitled to a lawyer, or -- and -- and or, else, we terminate. I don't know why that isn't enough.",
  "He doesn't care whether he gets an attorney, so long as he doesn't have to talk to investigators. That's the issue, whether he must talk to these investigators, and he is told, right up-front, You don't have to do it, and if -- if you want an attorney for it, we will get you an attorney. Otherwise, we -- we will terminate the interview.",
  "He doesn't ask for an attorney. He just says, I don't want to talk without an attorney. That's what he says. He doesn't demand an attorney. He says, I don't want to talk without an attorney. And the investigators say, Okay, in that case, we won't talk to you.",
  "The right to counsel in the course of interrogation.",
  "This -- this statute is a misdemeanor statute, isn't it?",
  "Yeah. And the only reason what happened here was elevated to a felony was that he had a prior offense.",
  "So it's understandable that the slightest touch could -- could constitute a misdemeanor.",
  "But we don't have to know what's more normal anyway, do we?",
  "If -- if any conviction is possible under the element of the crime to touch, when there is simply slight physical force, your argument still stands, right?",
  "Well, of course it's right. You don't have to touch somebody for an assault.",
  "You can just threaten somebody.",
  "That's not a crime of violence. Ms. Call: And that would be - -",
  "Of course it's right.",
  "Certainly not.",
  "Isn't there a separate -- a separate battery crime, aggravated battery, in -- in Florida, which - -",
  "Well, this isn't -- this isn't a felony battery statute. This is a misdemeanor battery statute, which has been elevated to a felony in this case only because the fellow had a prior.",
  "But, besides the misdemeanor battery statute, there are two felony battery statutes in Florida, right?",
  "And how -- how are they defined?",
  "Misdemeanor does?",
  "Right.",
  "You -- you would have to have other States which only have a battery statute that is defined as broadly as this misdemeanor battery statute in Florida. If they have a higher degree of battery, just as Florida does, which is a felony, then, if the - - if the prosecutor wants this fellow to be convicted of a violent crime, he -- he could charge him with that - - with that higher degree.",
  "Are there any States that have only this simple battery statute, which is -- which is met by a simple touching?",
  "No. No. You mistook my question.",
  "Are there any States in which the only prosecution for battery that can be brought is under a statute as broad as this one, which is -- is covered by even a touching?",
  "Don't all of the other States that have a touching statute also have higher degree of battery statutes?",
  "Do they use battery in the statute here? I am looking for it. I don't -- I don't see the word \"battery\" at all.",
  "Excuse me. Under 1 it depends upon the elements, but what about 2 and especially the residual provision of 2, \"any other conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\"? I would think rape qualifies under that.",
  "And many of the other crimes that Justice Breyer has been talking about.",
  "I dare say that the next time somebody comes to argue before this Court that a crime is not included within Section 2 because it's not a property crime, I don't think that person is going to get one vote.",
  "I thought you said they all had such -- such aggravated statutes in your answer to me. Now you just said many of them do. Which is it?",
  "You -- you -- you would have us believe that by \"violent felony\" in this -- in this statute, Congress meant the threat -- the threat? It doesn't even have to be the act. You know, if you don't shut up, I am going to come over and thwonk you on your shoulder with my index finger. I'm going to (snap). This is a violent felony under this statute which gets him how many more years?",
  "Fifteen years for (snap).",
  "But that's all he's necessarily been convicted of. When a verdict is brought in in Florida under this misdemeanor statute, all you know for sure is that he threatened to go (snap). That's all you know for sure that he has been convicted of, and you are going to give him 15 years.",
  "No, but you don't prosecute them for pick pocketing. You have a clumsy pick pocket and you prosecute him for battery, right? And he gets 15 years.",
  "You know, I guess it comes down to whether we think that in -- in B1, Congress was using technical language or Congress was using simply ordinary language, because you are quite right that the definition of -- of battery covers even the slightest touching. The use of physical force, which would include the slightest touching. But in using that definition to define the term \"violent felony,\" I find it hard to believe that Congress was using the term in a technical sense, and was not using the term \"physical force,\" \"the use of physical force\" to mean something more than a mere touching. But that's -- that's basically what we are arguing, isn't it? Whether that -- whether that phrase there, \"threatened use of physical\" -- \"use or threatened use of physical force,\" is technical language which is the definition of battery, or rather more common usage. You -- you would acknowledge that, that in more common usage, no one -- no one would think that if you go over to somebody and point your finger at him on his lapel and say, \"Now, you listen to me,\" that that would be considered the use or threatened use of physical force?",
  "Where is the provision? 922(g)(9), is that in your brief somewhere?",
  "I am looking for it. I don't see it. 922(g)(9).",
  "I hate people talking about statutes that I don't have in front of me.",
  "3(a).",
  "I thought you said 922. That's what I thought you said.",
  "Explosives.",
  "But (2) -- (2) looks to the conduct, it doesn't look to the element of the crime. So you could actually look to the conduct of which the person was convicted, no?",
  "No, no, no. You look to the crime -- under (1), you look to the crime he was convicted of, and if -- if -- if none of its elements require serious physical force, you can say it doesn't qualify under (1), but under (2) if in fact you see the misdemeanor he was convicted of was really whacking somebody really hard, then -- then it could possibly come within -- come under (2).",
  "Just at the elements.",
  "Can I ask you about - - about 922? You point to the -- the definition there, the definition in 921. But that is a definition of the term, misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. And in the context of defining that term, I'm perfectly willing to believe that the use or attempted use of physical force means even the slightest touching, as -- as battery does. You are talking about a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. But what we have before us here is a term - - a different term that is being defined and that term is violent felony. And I find it a lot harder to swallow that -- that that definition embraces merely the slightest touching.",
  "I dare say that Congress in my view probably didn't even contemplate that something which is a misdemeanor could become a violent felony if you did it the second time.",
  "Have we ever approved that, by the way, kicking it up to the felony category simply because of recidivism?",
  "States do it all the time when they have different degrees of battery. Misdemeanor -- felony battery -- they do it all the time.",
  "Except for the -- for the language, which -- which says that you -- you time it from the beginning of the time granted.",
  "Well, what's the effect of that language then? Why didn't (D) just read \"delay resulting from any pretrial motion\"?",
  "And counsel wouldn't know until -- wouldn't know whether the time was excluded or not until -- until a later finding is either made or not made.",
  "Can I ask you about the language of (h)(1)? Do you think it's -- do you think it's proper to consider a period of delay that precedes the filing of the motion? That is, a period of delay in order to prepare the motion, as a delay resulting from a proceeding that has not yet occurred?",
  "The grant of the motion is the proceeding?",
  "Is the proceeding.",
  "And you say the order is a proceeding for that purpose, the order granting the extension of time?",
  "I don't understand -- I don't understand the government to be argue -- to be arguing that they are treated differently.",
  "They are saying whoever - - whoever asked for the extension of time in order to prepare the motion gets it. And -- and it's the time limit's suspended.",
  "Well - -",
  "-- they made it very clear here that they think it applies to both the defendant and the government.",
  "What do you mean by a \"for-profit commercial market\"? You mean anything that is sold, right?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, of course it is. I mean, you can't separate the means from the end and say, since its end is simply to prevent the -- the activity, the means, which is to prevent the communication, is okay. It is targeting the communication of videos that depict this conduct.",
  "Child -- child pornography is obscenity as far as I am concerned, and it has been treated as part of that same traditional classification which there has always been permission for the government to prohibit. This is something quite different. I mean, you know, what if -- what if I -- I am an aficionado of bullfights and I think, contrary to the animal cruelty people, I think it -- they enoble both beast and man, and I want to persuade people that bullfights are terrific and we should have them. I would -- I would not be able to -- to market videos showing people how exciting a bullfight is. Right? I would be able to talk and say, oh, you should really allow bullfights, but I cannot make the most significant point that I want to make, get people to watch it.",
  "Well, wait. Wait. I don't understand that. Any depiction of bullfighting is educational?",
  "And that is true because Congress said so?",
  "Well, I guess a dogfight is educational, too.",
  "So noneducational bullfighting would be prohibited? If I market this just because I think, boy, bullfighting is really exciting?",
  "Okay. It is covered.",
  "\"Or killed.\" How do you limit \"killed\" to cruel -- you say in your brief that it's noscitur ex sociis. But that's a doctrine that says when you have a string of words, one of which has various meanings, which meaning it has depends upon the words with which it is associated. So if you speak of staples, staples -- what, thumb tacks, nails, and other fasteners, \"nails\" obviously doesn't mean toenails. It means a nail that is a fastener, the word \"nail\" having various meanings. \"Kill\" has one meaning, which is kill. And you can -- you cannot limit that meaning just because in addition to killing you also prohibit torturing and other things. Do you have a single case where -- where that doctrine is used not to give meaning to an ambiguous word, but to limit the meaning of a word which on its face is absolutely clear?",
  "What is that?",
  "Exactly.",
  "No, it's not susceptible to a wide -- that's my whole point. It means kill.",
  "Some people think eating an animal is animal cruelty. These people don't eat meat because it is the product of killing animals.",
  "Well, it shouldn't have said that, then.",
  "You don't have a single case in which a -- an absolutely clear word like \"kill\" is given a more narrow meaning because of other words that are different from that word.",
  "But the first order problem occurs in states where it is not illegal. These videos are taken in states where bullfighting or dog fighting or cock fighting is entirely legal. So, I don't know how you distinguish a -- a movie which many people think that violence in movie brutalizes people and causes violence in people's action. Why couldn't Congress, persuaded by these people say, you know, you can't have -- cannot depict torture? You know, these horror films that come out around Halloween, you can't depict that anymore. What is the difference between that and what you have done here?",
  "Who knows.",
  "If you dress up like an ancient Roman, the whole thing is of historical interest?",
  "Is that it?",
  "A different category. That is traditional First Amendment law that obscenity is not protected. And child pornography, as far as I am concerned, and I think as far as the Court is concerned is obscenity.",
  "His message is that getting animals to fight is fun. That's his message.",
  "To say he -- you know, he can convey that message in some other way, how else does he do it?",
  "Simulated dog fights would be okay under this statute?",
  "Requires?",
  "Oh.",
  "It's such an unusual word. I haven't heard it in a legal argument in a long time.",
  "It's just not significant value; significant artistic, educational. What are the others? Scientific?",
  "Strictly entertainment value doesn't count, does it?",
  "And most of the hunting videos I have seen people watch for the entertainment. They like to see a hunt.",
  "It could be that the reason hunting videos are still out there is that the producers were quite confident that this Court would not allow them to be prohibited on the base of a statute such as this.",
  "I really think you should focus, not on the educational value for -- to make people hate bull fighting and things, but on quite the opposite, it seems to me. On the right under the First Amendment of people who like bull fighting, who like dog fighting, who like cock fighting, to present their side of -- of the debate. And unless it's a subject like obscenity, which from the beginning has not been considered protected speech, it seems to me that side of the debate is entitled to make its point as -- as forcefully as possible. That's it seems to me what the problem is here. Not - -",
  "You can create a lot of First Amendment horribles. What about -- what about a new Adolf Hitler? Can we censor any depiction of that new Adolf Hitler and the horrible things that he is proposing, including extermination of a race? Is that proscribable under the First Amendment? Is that any less horrible than the human sacrifice contemplation?",
  "I would have thought that your response to Justice Breyer's comment about catering to people's worst instincts in the area of the First Amendment, at least, would have been that it's not up to the government to decide what are people's worst instincts. If -- if the First Amendment means anything, that's what it means.",
  "It's not up to the government to tell us what our worst instincts are - -",
  "Except for those areas that have traditionally been outside the area of -- of protected speech, and -- and once you allow this one, what other -- what other base instincts do people have, besides this one? One can contemplate a lot of other areas, where government could say, You are appealing to people's worst instincts, and, therefore, the -- the movies cannot be made.",
  "Adolf Hitler, can we keep him off the screen, too?",
  "I don't understand. Are you saying, since there is no human sacrifice in this country and no market to be dried up, the videos would be okay?",
  "Yeah; but we don't have any human sacrifice. Nobody's doing that stuff. So you could not proscribe the human sacrifice channel.",
  "How about the statute's term, \"kill\" - -",
  "-- what should that be interpreted to mean?",
  "If you shoot a little low and wound the animal, that is cruelty even though you didn't intend that.",
  "But what about your response to Justice Stevens on the hunting matter? I understand Congress wasn't directed at - -",
  "Can -- can I ask you, one of the points made by the amicus is that, if I recall it correctly, that what -- what Congress had in mind in phrasing it this way was to enable -- enable the party who had not gone to the Copyright Office to go after dismissal on jurisdictional grounds, and the implication is that if it were not held to be jurisdictional, there would be a merits dismissal because of the failure to have gone to the Copyright Office first. And therefore would not -- the plaintiff would not be able to come back to the court.",
  "I don't - -",
  "No, I didn't -- I didn't think it related to the third sentence. I -- I thought she said the whole purpose of Congress was to make sure that you'd be able to come back, that your failure to go to the Copyright Office initially would not result in a merits dismissal so that you could not later go back and then rebring the suit. If it was jurisdictional, just a jurisdictional dismissal, the jurisdiction could be cured by going to the Copyright Office and your suit could then proceed.",
  "You would be - -",
  "You'd be able to come back anyway?",
  "That's what I thought.",
  "That's what I thought you'd say.",
  "Yeah.",
  "And -- and - -",
  "Well, you shouldn't use loose language, especially when it's the same loose language, supposedly, that seems to have been used by all the courts of appeals and all the district courts.",
  "For years and years.",
  "But how -- how would we get to hold what -- what you say is the law? It seems, to me, once we decide it's not jurisdictional and once we agree with you, that it doesn't -- at least in this case -- didn't have to be raised sua sponte by the district court. That's the end of the case, and so why do we have to engage in the further discussion, well, ordinarily, the district court must raise it on its own and -- you know, and, if it doesn't ordinarily - - you know, the appellate court should. Why do we have to get into that?",
  "Which means we shouldn't.",
  "Well, that's normal, but not invariable.",
  "Unless it is plain error.",
  "It's pretty plain that the things haven't been registered. I mean, right? And it's pretty plain that if they hadn't been registered, the district court should not have proceeded with the case. So I don't know why it wouldn't normally be plain error in -- in the court of appeals.",
  "\"Until.\" That's a limitation period.",
  "Until preregistration or registration has been made.",
  "That's our limitation period.",
  "General Kagan, before you go -- go on with your argument, you presented it as - - as though the issue before us is the -- the conveying of the land. But is it? What this was was simply an affirmation of the prior injunction. The court of appeals said the prior injunction had not been mooted by the -- by the transfer of the land. So isn't really the issue whether that -- that prior injunction, when the land did indeed belong to the government, whether that prior injunction was valid?",
  "Right.",
  "But didn't the court of appeals say no?",
  "So -- so what we have before us is the court of appeals' affirmation of the prior injunction, which applied to a cross on public land.",
  "Of course, if I -- if I thought the display wasn't unconstitutional, the transfer would a fortiori not - -",
  "It seems to me unreasonable to read the injunction to say the government shall not permit anybody to display a cross on that land no matter who owns the land. I assume the injunctions meant you will not permit the cross to be displayed on this parcel of government land.",
  "Well, of course, it was that, but the question is whether it was a permissible amendment by the government of the situation. Of course, I will stipulate that the government was trying to arrange it so that the cross could remain there. But that doesn't mean that it was -- it was evading the injunction. I mean, that's - -",
  "Unless the injunction clearly applied to the erection of a cross on private land that the government had -- had transferred.",
  "I will -- I will concede that the obvious purpose of that was to avoid being in violation of the injunction. But that doesn't mean that it's invalid.",
  "The cross doesn't honor non-Christians who fought in the war? Is that -- is that - -",
  "Where does it say that?",
  "It's erected as a war memorial. I assume it is erected in honor of all of the war dead. It's the -- the cross is the -- is the most common symbol of -- of -- of the resting place of the dead, and it doesn't seem to me -- what would you have them erect? A cross -- some conglomerate of a cross, a Star of David, and you know, a Moslem half moon and star?",
  "I don't think you can leap from that to the conclusion that the only war dead that that cross honors are the Christian war dead. I think that's an outrageous conclusion.",
  "Has the government ever turned down -- let's say the Jewish war veterans request to put up a war memorial on - -",
  "I am talking about -- on this site?",
  "You know, well, I'm not talking about this site, where there already was a memorial, but suppose the -- what I'm getting at is I don't agree with you, that -- that every time the government allows any religious symbol to be erected, it has to allow all religious symbols to be erected at the same place, so long as it is -- it is not discriminatory in -- in accepting or rejecting requests to erect religious symbols in different places. I don't see why the government is convicted of being discriminatory.",
  "But -- but you don't - - and they -- were both of them proposed by a private group, such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars?",
  "Well, but it was erected by the Veterans of Foreign Wars. I mean, do you know of any instance in which Jewish war veterans or if there is an organization of Muslim war veterans, requested to erect a memorial on public land, it was turned down?",
  "I just don't see why they all have to be on the same piece of land, in -- in order for the government to be impartial.",
  "Well, I think you are saying that, and you are saying that this has to be a public forum. In fact, I'm not even sure your -- your brief would limit it to religious symbols. You say it has to be an open forum. Right?",
  "Do I understand you to say that that provision was not applicable here anyway?",
  "Does the other side contest that?",
  "But it didn't -- it didn't promise them that categorically. There were certain things they had to do, right? One of which was to have conferencing, and in three of these cases they didn't. So that promise didn't extend at least to those three cases. And in the other two, where there was conferencing, the act also provides, as any sensible act would have to, for the adoption of procedural rules. And the procedural rule here, according to the arbitrator, required the submission of that evidence of -- of consultation with the complaint, which didn't happen.",
  "Do -- do you say that all five were -- were conferenced? Is that your position?",
  "It's in the statute, isn't it?",
  "Do they do anything else? What do they do? What does the adjustment board do?",
  "I don't want to get you in trouble, but I'm not sure they do anything.",
  "I don't know how that could possibly be true. I can't imagine being an arbitrator and not being able to say: All right, you know, we are going to have a conference next Tuesday. I want you to have all of the -- all of the papers relevant to this particular point that we are going to discuss in by two days before. Can't do that?",
  "I would not know how to run an arbitration without -- without establishing some rules of procedure.",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, at least back off from your statement that an arbitrator cannot set rules of procedure.",
  "Oh, all right. That's a little different.",
  "Well, you're making sense. It says that, or it just doesn't address the question of whether they have to be included in the original submission? I mean, I assume there is no provision that says -- or I missed it, there is no provision that says the conferencing materials do not have to be included in the original submission?",
  "I thought you said he did have rulemaking power, so long as it did not contradict - -",
  "Let's not get -- can I ask about argumentative facts? I frankly have never heard of a phrase like argumentative facts. You seem to think it means only those facts that are in dispute.",
  "Well, that would be a pretty incomprehensible statement of the -- of the event, if you write in your brief statement of facts and you only write down the facts that are disputed and none of the facts that are agreed to. It couldn't possibly mean that. I would think that argumentative facts simply means facts relevant to the argument, and one of the facts relevant to the argument is whether you did the necessary consultation. But I don't know how you could interpret argumentative facts to mean only those facts that are in dispute. What kind of a statement of facts would that be?",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, we can't leave that for another day. I mean, we -- we have to decide whether we are opening a Pandora's box here, whether there is any sensible way to restrict it to -- to deportation. What about advice on whether pleading guilty would -- would cause him to lose custody of his children? That's -- that's pretty serious. What if pleading guilty will -- will affect whether he can keep his truck, which is his main means of livelihood, or whether -- whether it would be seized by the government as the instrument of his crime? There are so many pieces of advice which involve legal issues that -- that counsel can provide advice on.",
  "Sure.",
  "Sure.",
  "But that's -- that's -- with due respect, that's ridiculous. If it's important enough to be required to be told to the defendant by his counsel, surely it's important enough to be advised to the defendant by the court before the guilty plea is accepted as -- as voluntary, which includes knowing –- knowing the consequences. It's a very strange line you draw between what we are going to hold counsel to and what we are going to require the defendant to be advised of by the court.",
  "I would think that the duty of the criminal lawyer is to make sure that the defendant's guilty plea is informed, it is an informed guilty plea. That is the same obligation of the court in the colloquy, to be sure that it's an informed plea. And if you say it's uninformed for counsel not to go into the myriad collateral consequences, then I assume it's -- it's improper for the court not to go into those consequences. They both pertain to whether the guilty plea is informed. That's counsel's responsibility.",
  "Well --",
  "I thought -- I thought he was asked what was in the -- what was in the containers and he said marijuana.",
  "What -- what about misadvice as to whether he will lose custody of his children, or misadvice as to whether his -- his truck which he owns will be confiscated by the government?",
  "What are the consequences to the lawyer? I mean, let's assume you are a public defender, and you are confronted with this situation. Is it -- how -- how much skin is it off your teeth if you provide the advice, even though you are uncertain, and the advice turns out to be wrong? What happens to the lawyer?",
  "So, what incentive is there to withhold uncertain advice? Is there any incentive at all?",
  "I mean, the worst that can happen is your client will get off.",
  "He’ll make a guilty plea, and afterwards it will be set aside.",
  "After -- after a mini-trial, which deprives the government of -- of its whole benefit from the guilty plea. Governments accept guilty pleas in order to avoid the time and expense of going to -- to a trial. And here you have to go back and find out what the evidence would have been, so that the court can make the decision you say is so easy.",
  "Well, but assuming it's a norm and that all lawyers do it, including those that know diddly about immigration law, the norm is to give bad advice. And -- and here the norm was met, right?",
  "I thought the point is that -- I thought your point was that –- that Strickland does require professional norms to be observed, but it is professional norms regarding advising a defendant as to the trial consequences of his plea, as to those matters that are involved in the prosecution, and not as to collateral matters. Isn't that your point?",
  "Those are the only norms that are relevant, what norms oblige counsel to advise a defendant regarding trial matters.",
  "Excue me, I'm not sure that parole eligibility could qualify as a collateral consequence.",
  "It goes to the sentence. It goes to what the sentence will be, which is certainly part of the trial.",
  "Why do you say that? Why do you say that? Or there has not been a revolution or what? What -- how do you know?",
  "These experts said he had improved?",
  "Before this testimony on the stand?",
  "Wow.",
  "That didn't look like improvement to me.",
  "Well, I think -- I think it was swallowing the worst evidence. It was telling the jury that was going to think this is a hateful person who had done hateful things. I agree with you. I accept all of that, but even if you feel that way, I thought it was a brilliant closing argument. You said you've -- you've conducted many capital cases. Have you ever conducted a capital case in which the defendant takes the stand with a Hitler moustache and says he's glad for what he's done and he will do it again? How many cases have you had like that?",
  "This was an extraordinary trial, and it seems to me that the -- that the technique that -- that counsel used to try to get mercy for this fellow was -- was the best that could have been done.",
  "So I think that we have to defer to all of those, right?",
  "I think, if they could have been relying on any of those, we would have to defer to all, wouldn't we?",
  "One-by-one, I mean -­",
  "Why would we assume that?",
  "When we -- when you don't know what a lower court has done, the rule is you assume the best, not the worst. Isn't that the standard rule of review?",
  "You, very often, don't know on what basis the lower court took action. You assume it was a lawful basis.",
  "Which insulates it from being overturned.",
  "But that is not what AEDPA says. AEDPA says that we have to give deference unless it is an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law. The burden is on the appealing defendant to show that it was an unreasonable application. In case of doubt, he loses. Now, AEDPA could have been written differently. It could have been written the way you want. The Supreme Court shall evaluate the reasonableness of the Supreme Court opinion. It isn't written that way. It says the burden is on you to show that this was an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law. And where there is a summary disposition, that's a hard road aho.",
  "It's -- it's not impossible. I think there are cases where -- where relying on prior Supreme Court law doesn't get you there. It's not impossible.",
  "So we should revise the statute and it should not say unreasonable application of Supreme Court law?",
  "Why doesn't it?",
  "That's not how the -­ that's not how the statute reads.",
  "That's not what it says. That's not what it says. It says that you have to show that it is an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law. That's what it says.",
  "And if they can't, you lose. Because that's the way the statute reads.",
  "You want to say if they can't, we have a new statute. But we don't. The burden on you is to show that it's an unreasonable application. If you tell me we can't tell, you lose.",
  "Counsel, I don't understand that, I don't understand that. Do you want to go around that again?",
  "Does Teague say anything about time?",
  "Where -- where is that in the instructions? I -- I didn't realize that that's what you are counting on. Where is it?",
  "It's in your brief, I assume.",
  "Read it again?",
  "New? New?",
  "Is that in your brief, too? I just don't remember it from your brief.",
  "Mr. Frederick, we -- we had a case involving, what, a tax on -- on oil companies, in which it was a State against State case, but we allowed the oil companies who would pay the tax to intervene. Now, why is that any different from this case?",
  "Why does that make any difference?",
  "Yes, well, these – these are rules that we are making up ourselves, right, as to when we are going to allow intervention or not? Do –- is there any case -- I think there isn't, but tell me if I'm wrong -- is there any case in which we have rejected intervention that has been recommended by the Special Master?",
  "Well, except that these -- these three entities are the principal entities that are guilty of interbasin transfers, which is essentially what the -- what the dispute is about.",
  "Well, but the focus -- the focus of the complaint is upon interbasin transfers, isn't it?",
  "Exactly. And these three entities account for a very large proportion of those interbasin transfers. Isn't it the case that any -- any decision by -- by this Court on -- on this question will necessarily impact directly these three entities?",
  "Why not?",
  "I understand that, but I'm talking about the real world. If -- if indeed North Carolina has to cut back, and if indeed the opinion of this Court says that it's taking too much because of interbasin transfers, as a practical matter these three entities are going to be out of luck.",
  "Are you --",
  "But, in fact, we've never rejected a special master's desire to -- to have intervenors in the case.",
  "And that oil case that I mentioned. I forget the name of it. The tax --",
  "Yes. What had the Special Master recommended in that case?",
  "Well, we've -- we've allowed private parties to be impleaded by the States. We have allowed one State to sue another State and a private party.",
  "I don’t --",
  "It depends on, I suppose, on what you mean by “is not properly represented by the State.” If you think the State does not have a sufficient interest to defend that -- that particular right vigorously, might that not be -- might not that qualify?",
  "I think you could say that realistically when you are talking about an individual water user, a small potatoes water user, a normal resident of Charlotte perhaps. But when you are talking about the biggest entities that are going to be affected by the apportionment, it really doesn't ring true to me.",
  "Did the special master think Philadelphia should have been let in?",
  "The answer is no.",
  "Yes, but we haven't -- we haven't been sitting there trying to figure out what would facilitate the proceeding. Much of the discovery in the case has already focused on these three entities, hasn't it?",
  "So to say that they are just -- you know, they are just Joe Dokes is –- is really very unrealistic.",
  "Well, if that -- if and when that is the case, the Special Master will not want them to come in, as the vast majority of special masters have not wanted them to come in, in the past. I don't think that's going to change.",
  "But not reserved exclusively to State -- to suits between a State and another State. We've allowed it to cover suits between a State and another State and private citizens of the other State.",
  "Well, it isn't a matter of infringing on water rights or apportionments. I mean, that does not exclude, it seems to me, the revocation of the license or the denial of a renewal of the license because Duke Power does not have enough water. That wouldn't preclude that, would it?",
  "I don't -- I don't understand that. I don't understand that.",
  "Well, why --",
  "Well, it may also mean it when it has to increase the outflow, the level of its impoundments reduces, and that may affect its ability to generate power, which in turn may -- may affect its license.",
  "Yes, I think all FERC said is -- is that nothing in its license would -- would require allocation of water by -- by North Carolina. And that's quite different from whether -- whether a severe reduction in the water that Duke can use would -- would affect the -- the nature of the license given by FERC.",
  "And is it automatic then? Is it automatic then? Or is it just that, when that condition is met, the Special Master can permit the intervention?",
  "And, also, how helpful the intervention will be to the management of the case.",
  "And, of course, the Special Master's determination of that is not final. It's ultimately up to us.",
  "But it is a discretionary intervention you are arguing for, not a mandatory one.",
  "Do you think the same -- the same test applies to the appropriateness of naming a private party defendant, as you would urge for intervention by a private party defendant?",
  "Well, in -- in deciding what's equitable as between the two States, I guess the -- the Court, ultimately, and the Special Master, initially, will have to decide what uses of water by one State or the other are not equitable uses --",
  "-- and go beyond what is reasonable. So I don't see how you could decide the case without deciding whether especially particularly massive uses are appropriate or not.",
  "Dead losses to South Carolina.",
  "And I guess it depends on what you mean by the water in dispute. If the main gravamen of the complaint is interbasin transfers, they -- they occupy a huge proportion of that.",
  "Did -- did the decree only apply to taxing these particular companies? Could the -- could the State have taxed other companies after the decree issued?",
  "Is that yes or no? I -- you say yes, it would have general applicability.",
  "But it affects the agreement on which the license is based. The license was based upon a very hard negotiated agreement among a number of entities.",
  "I thought Duke said the problem is not the United States -- so much the United States granting a license. It's the license we requested was based upon a negotiated agreement among a number of entities, and that agreement goes out the window once -- on the basis of this lawsuit.",
  "It wasn't granted then, and it still hasn't been granted.",
  "So you have nobody before this Court with a live claim, neither the original named plaintiffs nor a certified class.",
  "So who's here?",
  "What were they seeking to have enjoined?",
  "But -- I -- since they defaulted in the -- in the final hearing, how can –- can they possibly have any claim left with regard to an interim hearing?",
  "And they -- and they can do that before the -- before the time period has expired?",
  "The statute is a dead letter if you allow a Slocum action. All you -- all you need is a Slocum action, and the fact that the statute says you have to wait for -- you know, that the government has 40 days, is meaningless.",
  "Exactly. It's a way of defeating the statute.",
  "But the statute says the government isn't dilatory until -- until the time period, 40 days. It has 40 days. What does that mean if it doesn't mean that the government has 40 days?",
  "Before the 40 days?",
  "Oh, okay. Well, that's a different story. These people are asking for a hearing before the elapsing of the 40 days, and if all -- if all you say that Slocum provides is a hearing after the 40 days have elapsed and nothing has occurred, that doesn't satisfy what they are asking for.",
  "It doesn't have to do anything for 40 days, is what the statute says.",
  "But you say if it -- you don't dispute that doesn't have to do anything, but you -- you assert that if it does nothing, you can bring a Slocum action. I mean, which is it? One or the other?",
  "Ten years?",
  "Ten years?",
  "You’ve -- you’ve given up the position, then. You've said time does matter. So we are just arguing over what the time is, whether it's 10 years, 1 year, or 40 days, right?",
  "It may be, but that's a different argument. It's -- it's not an absolute. It's -- we have to consider whether the time period is reasonable, right?",
  "Well, what were they seeking to enjoin?",
  "Suppose a situation in which the property taken is really essential to the -- to the living of the person from whom -- who owns it -- a car -- and the person needs a car to get to work every day. And -- and there is really no reason why the -- why the government has to wait that long. Is there no procedure by which he can say, you know -- do it quickly. You don't have to wait so long. I'm the owner. I'm the only owner. I can -- I can prove that. Let's have a quick hearing.",
  "And you say it was likely to -- these same named plaintiffs were likely –- likely -- to face this same situation again?",
  "Well, if you are relying on -- on, you know, \"capable of repetition, yet evading review,\" that's -- that's the test, whether -- whether indeed these people stand a chance of having the same thing happen.",
  "You are begging the question. That is, you are assuming that the class is a valid class. It hasn't been certified. How -- how can you make that -- that argument when there is no class?",
  "Just an asserted class on your part. There’s no class.",
  "As it turns out it -- it wouldn't have been gratuitous.",
  "I thought you said -- I thought you said the innocent owner defense didn't have to be inquired into in the probable cause here. I thought that was your position.",
  "Okay, you want –-",
  "Okay. That makes it harder. You’re challenging this -- this statute on its face, isn't that right?",
  "No?",
  "Just as applied?",
  "No, how can you have an --",
  "How can you have an as-applied challenge to an entire class?",
  "Why -- why -- to -- to have an as-applied challenge, regardless of whether the Illinois law provides a -- a remedy, wouldn't you be able to individually assert under section 1983 unconstitutional action? I mean, isn't there a Federal remedy? If all you're concerned about is as-applied, you mean you are being treated unconstitutionally by a State and you have no remedy?",
  "Why isn't that enough?",
  "But they will know about the probable cause hearing that you want to -- that you want set up, right?",
  "Which -- which is why you are asking for a facial challenge. You want these hearings in all cases --",
  "-- regardless of what the individual circumstances are; isn't that so?",
  "It is not so?",
  "Well, what are the individual circumstances of all the other people in the class? We don't know what they are. We don't know whether it's a car that has been taken, money that has been taken, whether they are millionaires, whether they need the car. We know nothing about them.",
  "You think -- you think it's unconstitutional as applied to everybody who is not given this -- this preliminary hearing. That's -- that's what the complaint says. Your -- the class you want certified is the class of everybody who has not been given a preliminary hearing. I don't know the difference between that and saying that this statute is unconstitutional as applied.",
  "I mean, just –- just because you don't say in your complaint, this is a facial challenge, it amounts to a facial challenge. You say, everybody who has not been given a preliminary hearing is entitled to relief because the statute is bad as to all of them.",
  "That is not the class you asked to be certified. You asked to certify everybody who had been denied a preliminary hearing.",
  "It doesn't change this -- this action from a class action -- from a facial challenge into a nonfacial challenge. They can't change your complaint. You were either asking this to be struck down on its face, or you weren't. And what -- what the Seventh Circuit did doesn't change that.",
  "Some of them are worth --",
  "-- a lot of money. Yes.",
  "“My potential class,” you should call it.",
  "I thought they didn't. I thought some didn't have it returned, but there was a settlement.",
  "The mootness was not a result of any settlement between the city and --",
  "Your -- your friend said the opposite. I mean --",
  "I don't understand.",
  "They got all of their property back?",
  "No, I don't understand. They got their cars back, right?",
  "The people who had money at stake, what happened to the money?",
  "A settlement?",
  "So you have at least one case where the mootness is attributable to a settlement. You have at least one plaintiff, and you can't get the kind of remand for mootness that you are asking for.",
  "But we don't do Munsingwear orders where -- where the mootness is a result of a settlement.",
  "What is similar -- what is similar work?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, that has nothing to do with the -- with the quality of the representation, does it?",
  "Why didn't it name those factors as -- as the determinative factors, instead of saying, and therefore they should get more money for quality?",
  "Okay. They advanced -- they advanced money for experts --",
  "-- during the case. The contingency, which we rejected as a -- as a basis. And what was the third one?",
  "They weren't paid on --",
  "Isn't that -- isn't that the same as contingency?",
  "Well, I suppose the question under the statute is whether it would be a reasonable attorney's fee, and I guess one way to determine that is to ask whether it would be considered reasonable if a law firm that billed a client according to their regular hourly rates came in and said, but we're going to kick it up another -- you know, another $10,000 because this -- this second-year associate, boy, he's a whiz, and he performed like a senior partner. So we are going to -- we are billing him at the $500 rate, instead of the $200. Would -- would that be considered a reasonable attorney's fee?",
  "I didn’t think so.",
  "Or, indeed, you don't know that the brilliance of the second-year associate enables the $500-an-hour partner to spend less time on the matter. Presumably it does. It's so great when it comes to him, he doesn't have to do much work.",
  "You are saying we can never exceed the lodestar amount? I mean, we have said in some cases that in extraordinary circumstances it can. What are those extraordinary circumstances, or do you think there are none?",
  "Such as? That's what I'm asking.",
  "What are you referring to, if not attorney performance?",
  "You think that’s what we had in mind, huh? You think that’s what we had in mind when we said they are extraordinary circumstances?",
  "I think it's very imaginative, but I would never --",
  "-- but I would never have thought of it, and I doubt whether we did.",
  "Well, I mean, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.",
  "I mean, if -- if you get rewarded for unpopularity, you ought to be get penalized for popularity.",
  "You got a lot more clients because of this case.",
  "Well, but wait. That's pretty objective: results obtained. I mean, if, you know, the -- what was sought in the complaint was 100, and in fact you got only 30, you are still a prevailing party, but you shouldn't -- you shouldn't be compensated as though you got everything that was sought. I think that's much more objective than whether -- whether this attorney is the best one I've seen in 28 years. I have another problem with it. I don't like judges -- it's certainly not in the tradition of the bench to comment upon the performance of lawyers. I can't tell you how often I would like to give a separate grade for --",
  "-- for the lawyer who won a case. You know, one grade for the case and the other for the lawyer. But we don't do that. And if you do this going up, you've got to do it going down. And you could expect the judge to say: This is the worst performance I have seen in 28 years. Judges don't do that in our system, and I don't think -- I don't think we should set up a mechanism that induces them to do it.",
  "You say discretion. I say randomness. I mean, that is not a matter of discretion. It is a matter of randomness. How -- how long has the judge who observed this case been on the bench? If he has been there just a couple of years, kiss good-bye to your -- your extra money for being excellent. That's random. That's not discretion.",
  "So you want this Court to look to those cases -- you know, it's the world turned upside down. Instead of the lower courts reading our cases, we have to read lower court cases to decide what this statute means. Is that it?",
  "I don't do that.",
  "Yes.",
  "Of course, this statute was passed before we adopted the lodestar approach, wasn't it?",
  "Before this Court --",
  "No. I would think it cuts the other way. Congress was not contemplating that we would adopt approach -- an approach which takes into account the excellence of counsel.",
  "Have they applied it? If I recall your brief correctly, you say that the New York courts have applied it to causes of action arising under other State laws. Is that right?",
  "Can’t a statute be both? Can a statute both establish a substantive limitation and also establish a rule of procedure for New York courts? Why can't a statute say, New York courts will not entertain any action, including those arising under foreign law, that are class actions seeking penalties? And also, no New York State cause of action which seeks a penalty can be sued on in a -- in a collaborative action? Couldn't you do both in the same?",
  "Well, you are begging the question. It's a general instruction. But can't -- can't the instruction be interpreted to be both?",
  "It has to be one or the other, though. You -- you -- is it your position that if this is substantive, as you contend, it cannot be procedural? So New York State could not apply this -- this rule to out-of-State causes of action, and if it did, you -- you ought to have lost this case.",
  "And for lawyers?",
  "Lawyers have a fiduciary obligation to their clients; right?",
  "So courts should review lawyers' fees for -- on the basis of whether it's a fair result.",
  "That's different from normal trust law, isn't it?",
  "Normally where you are a fiduciary, it's up to you to prove that it was reasonable.",
  "So Congress evidently did not mean ordinary trust law to apply in this context.",
  "No, but he protects the company ultimately, because when investors leave the company that is charging excessive fees to go to other companies, the company that they are leaving sees that something's wrong and has to lower its compensation to its adviser. Why doesn't that affect the company at issue?",
  "Mr. Frederick, I don't understand your statement that they can't fire the investment adviser. Maybe they can't fire him, but they can insist that he accept a lower fee, right? Surely they can do that, can't they?",
  "Can they insist that he accept a lower fee? Can they do that.",
  "Why?",
  "Oh, no, that's something different. Let's assume you have a disinterested board of directors, which is what the statute requires. You tell me even though they are disinterested, they can't fire the adviser. It seems to me, while they can't fire him, they can say: We are going to cut your fee in half. Whereupon they don't have to fire him. He will pack up and leave, and they will get a new adviser. Doesn't that work?",
  "Well, it must be aware of the -- of the divergence between the fees that investment advisers charge to these companies and what they charge to other clients. Isn't the SEC aware of that?",
  "And yet has brought no suits against this industry?",
  "For disclosure, just for disclosure. But that suggests to me that the SEC may think that this is indeed a self-contained industry and that the comparison with investment advice given to other entities is -- is not a fair one.",
  "But even if there is full disclosure, your position is in every case a court must decide whether the fee is reasonable or not.",
  "That's a wonderfully clear command, isn't it? Such consideration as is appropriate? What is the language? Read it. What is it?",
  "Wow.",
  "No, it's meaningless. It tells the court to make its own judgment. Such consideration as the court deems due. Give it whatever -- whatever consideration you -- you feel like. It's utterly meaningless to me.",
  "Is that the test that the court of appeals here applied?",
  "Is that the test that the court of appeals here applied, whose judgment you want us to affirm?",
  "So we should remand it for application of the test that you propose?",
  "Surely that's a disputed fact, isn't it? And you want us to dispose -- or you want this to be disposed of on summary judgment. The other side says the services aren't that much different.",
  "It wasn't talking about this particular case. It was talking about in general, wasn't - -",
  "That are what?",
  "Would -- would you give us the citations of the parts of the record that you say render it unnecessary for us to remand for the lower court to consider a comparison with non- -- with institutional charges?",
  "At 16a of the Joint Appendix you are talking about?",
  "Of the petition.",
  "Where is that? I mean, why do we have to guess about it? Where -- where do you find that in its opinion? Because I have -- I have the same -- the same problem.",
  "Well, that may be, but where -- where do you get that from the opinion of the court of appeals here? I find it very easy to get from the opinion of the court of appeals the proposition that if there is discretion, it's not a firmly established rule. Where do you get your theory, that they had changed it from a discretionary rule to a mandatory rule at the time that the State court made this ruling? Where do you find that in the opinion of the court of appeals?",
  "Well, that's -- that's a different issue. Now, your -- your assertion is that what the court of appeals was based on -- decision was -- was not this that you are arguing now, but rather, it was based on the fact that there had been a change in the law from discretionary to mandatory. I can't find that, frankly, in the opinion, except in its reference to Doctor, so I have got to go back and read Doctor and guess that that's what they meant when they referred to Doctor. But assuming it's true, Justice Breyer says, even if it is true, what difference does it make? Because, even if they had changed from a discretionary to a mandatory, the trial court in the State had not realized that they had changed and gave him the discretionary. So what -- what complaint do you have?",
  "If -- if the new rule was applied to him.",
  "But the point is the new rule wasn't applied to him. The trial court thought that it had discretion.",
  "That's clear from the trial court's opinion, isn't it?",
  "And they concluded that was ridiculous, so they stopped doing it.",
  "Before or after his execution?",
  "Can I please - -",
  "Why do you pick 1984 as the time of the escape? Whether it's an adequate or independent State ground, whether it's been consistently applied, it seemed to me -- it seems to me you should look to the time at which the State rule is applied. Now, as of 1984 I suppose there are some notice requirements that you can say due process requires, but I don't know why the adequacy of the State ground, whether it's consistently applied, should be judged on the basis of what was the law in 1984, rather than what was the State law at the time they applied the rule.",
  "What -- what about his - - his colleague who broke out with him? How do you -- how do you explain that.",
  "Where would she say that, 100 percent interest in the equipment? Would she say that in -- in column 3?",
  "Column 3 says \"Value of claimed exemption.\"",
  "Well, I mean, you say that. But, boy, I wouldn't read -- I wouldn't read the -- I wouldn't read the -- the chart that way.",
  "It has a column that says \"Value of claimed exemption.\"",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Except that the -- that the last column does -- it’s very clearly entitled \"Current market value of property\" without deducting exemptions. There's no way to read that last figure of 10,718 except as her assessment of the market value of her cooking equipment.",
  "That -- is that where she would write 100 percent -- in the third column, rather than the fourth?",
  "Well, now, wait. Why would the trustee object? I mean, he would still be objecting to the valuation. You say that he has no -- no obligation to object to the valuation. But if she writes 100 percent of value in the third column, that's what she's claimed, and then values it at something above the exemption, right? Above the permissible objection, he's still objecting to the valuation, isn't he? No?",
  "I see.",
  "Well, it's not a realistic valuation. Nobody thinks that that's an honest valuation of the equipment. It's simply adding up the -- the exemption she was entitled to.",
  "It’s just -- her valuation just happened to be exactly the amount that the two exemptions she had would add up to.",
  "Well, but she was maxed out. Once she used it for that, she was maxed out, but she wanted to have her cake and eat it too. She wanted to get the exemption for the food and she wanted to get the exemption for the -- for the equipment. And so it just so happened that the equipment valuation added up to precisely what was left over after she took the exemption for the -- for the food.",
  "Did the lower court reach that question?",
  "Did we grant cert on that question?",
  "He took the words right out of your mouth.",
  "You could call them all advisory opinions if you want.",
  "Whenever there is another issue in the case --",
  "-- for which we remand, you could say, oh, we're just giving an advisory opinion on the issue that --",
  "Yes or no?",
  "Okay.",
  "Just and reasonable, or would comply with the public interest standard?",
  "I mean, what's the use of having Mobile-Sierra if -- if they're going to reexamine the thing under the usual standard anyway?",
  "You're saying, in effect, that Mobile-Sierra does not apply to an agreement between A and B that not only sets the rate between the two, but also fixes the rate that one of them will charge to C? The last feature is not a Mobile-Sierra -- is not eligible for Mobile-Sierra treatment.",
  "Right. But that's -- but that's not what the D.C. Circuit said.",
  "The D.C. Circuit said that the entire -- there is no application of Mobile-Sierra at all.",
  "Well, we -- we don't know that that's the other side's position. I was going to ask him that. Their position is that the third party can -- can attack the -- the agreement without being encumbered by Mobile-Sierra, but I don't know that they've said that once a third party does mount such an attack the Commission is suddenly also unencumbered by Mobile-Sierra.",
  "I have assumed that their position is the Commission remains bound by Mobile- Sierra, but these third parties can -- can demand a court -- that a court apply a different standard.",
  "We can --",
  "I'm not sure that's any stranger than saying the Commission has one standard until somebody else challenges it, whereupon the Commission has a different standard. You don't think that's strange?",
  "Yes.",
  "They're not bound to it. They -- they are saying that -- claiming -- that their rates are too high because the contract was too high, so -- and therefore, their rates are unreasonable. And what Mobile-Sierra says -- it certainly says it as between the two contracting parties -- that if it's at arm-length between sophisticated seller and buyer of -- of the power, they are bound by it, and the -- and the issue is here is whether somebody downstream who says that since this contract is so exorbitant, the rates are too high, whether that person is likewise bound by Mobile-Sierra. Isn't that right?",
  "But that -- that's because of section 4.C, you say?",
  "Right. Which -- which gives the Commission a good deal of flexibility, which you say you -- your clients don't have or your State doesn't have. But that isn't the basis on which this case was decided below. It was decided on the very simple basis that the Mobile-Sierra doctrine simply does not apply to challenges by third parties. It had nothing to do with the details of 4.C and the -- the excessive discretion given -- given to the Commission but not to you. It was a very simple proposition on which we granted cert, whether Mobile-Sierra's public interest standard applies when a contract rate is challenged by an entity that was not a party to the contract. That's the question. And what's your answer to that?",
  "Do you support the opinion of the -- of the court below?",
  "It isn't about contracts. It's about reasonable rates. I thought what it was, was a determination by the Commission, approved by -- by this Court, that when two giants of the industry, very knowledgeable, deal at arm's-length and come up with -- with a contract, that is presumptively reasonable, and unless it contravenes the public interest, that rate will -- will be upheld. Now, you say it should be upheld only between the two contracting parties. What good does that do?",
  "Yes, but we don't like to decide these questions, you know, initially. We -- we like to have some lower court do the dirty work, and we can correct them.",
  "It’s -- it's a lot easier that way, and we're more likely to reach a correct result, rather than -- than wading in with, you know, -- from scratch. That's our usual practice.",
  "Has anybody before --",
  "-- even suggested that Mobile-Sierra is a “sometimes” thing? Do -- did any of our opinions say that it's a “sometimes” thing, except in one respect, and that is the doctrine does not apply when -- when, downstream, the rates -- or even between the parties, the rates would violate the public interest? That's a “sometimes.” It won't apply then, but have we ever suggested that, you know, today it may; tomorrow it -- it won't? Or have we ever suggested what standards might determine the “sometimes” question?",
  "Have we ever suggested how you can -- you can have a “sometimes” doctrine which will produce the stability in the industry that Mobile- Sierra was intended to produce? I mean, that was the whole purpose of Mobile-Sierra. People had to be able to predict whether they can take natural gas out of the ground, how much they can make on it, and once they enter into an arm's-length contract, they should be able to rely on it. That was the whole purpose. And, now, you want to us say, well, sometimes it will work, and sometimes it won't. And we're not going to say when; we're going to leave it to the D.C. Circuit to invent some “sometimes.” That doesn't make any sense, does it?",
  "But FERC can’t -- can FERC -- can FERC challenge, too? Because FERC's a -- sort of a third party.",
  "Okay. So -- so Mobile-Sierra doesn't apply to FERC, even?",
  "Who does it apply to? I mean, it's just -- just the two parties?",
  "Okay.",
  "Can a noncontracting party go to FERC and challenge it before FERC, whereupon FERC is no longer bound by Mobile-Sierra? Or is FERC suddenly unchained when a third party brings a proceeding before FERC? It's a strange situation.",
  "No, no. The public interest standard is a just and reasonable standard. What -- what it amounts to is saying, when -- when you have a contract rate that's been negotiated between sophisticated parties, that rate is presumptively just and reasonable, and the only way you can show that it is not just and reasonable is to show that the public interest is harmed. It's -- it's not something different from the just and reasonable standard, or it would be contrary to -- to the statute because the statute requires that the rates be just and reasonable, right?",
  "I like that. That's very imaginative.",
  "There is no such adjective -- I know we have used it, but there is no such adjective as \"choate.\" There is \"inchoate,\" but the opposite of \"inchoate\" is not \"choate.\"",
  "Any more than the -- I don't know.",
  "Exactly. Yes. It's like \"gruntled.\"",
  "Exactly. \"Disgruntled\" and the opposite of \"disgruntled\" is \"gruntled.\"",
  "So why is this different? I mean, it's clear that \"property\" can mean that. You acknowledge that it can mean the government's entitlement to money from taxes?",
  "So it can mean that. Now why -- why should we say it doesn't mean that here?",
  "Is the word \"property\" used in the antitrust laws?",
  "What does it say?",
  "And it -- and it's clear that for purposes of the antitrust laws, property does not include the government's entitlement to income from taxes?",
  "Yes, but that -- that's something different. This isn't just the general, you know, you hurt the economy and therefore you hurt the State. Here, what they're saying is: You caused people who owed me taxes not to pay taxes, an identified sum of money.",
  "Well, it might have been inchoate but still -- they would have to be prove that, I assume, in the litigation here, wouldn't they? I mean, let's assume we let the litigation go forward. Wouldn't they have to prove what taxes were not paid?",
  "So worry about that later. I mean, just because some of them might be difficult to prove or not provable doesn't mean that the rest that are very clear do not constitute property.",
  "That's a different issue.",
  "You're going to talk about that one, aren't you?",
  "You've got it.",
  "What is it, a user tax once it gets into the city?",
  "Like automobiles.",
  "Just like automobiles. If you buy a car out of the State, you haven't paid the State sales tax, but if you bring it into the State, you have to pay a use tax.",
  "And that's all it was alleged that these websites said, \"tax-free\"? They said \"tax-free\"?",
  "\"Sales are tax-free.\" That's very clever.",
  "No -- \"no tobacco tax\"?",
  "But there is a tobacco tax, isn't there? Don't you -- wouldn't you call that use tax a tax on tobacco?",
  "Are there any sanctions for failing to comply with the Jenkins Act, just on its own, without having to go through RICO?",

  "It would probably cost them more to collect than -- than it's worth the money, don't you think, to sue individual citizens after they get the names?",
  "Excuse me. Did -- was there some statute at issue in that case which required not just an interest, but an interest in property?",
  "Well - -",
  "Why should that help?",
  "So how can you call it -- I mean, part of the problem with calling it property is there -- there is such a low chance of recovery of the amount owed here. Even if the Jenkins Act filing had been made, you still have to -- have to assume that this - - number one, you have to assume that the State would turn the list over to the city, which the State isn't required to do.",
  "Well, that may be, but the State isn't required to, and the State can terminate that agreement whenever it likes. But, secondly, after you get the information we have to assume that you're going to move against these people.",

  "Usually you're not liable for misrepresentation unless it causes -- it's relied on. You really think that the -- that a large percentage of the people who were getting this stuff really, really were gulled into believing that New York State was somehow being done out of taxes?",
  "Really?",
  "No, I am sure the purchaser knows: I'm not going to pay taxes, even though I should pay taxes. But you're -- you're telling me that the only reason the purchaser doesn't pay taxes is because of this misrepresentation that you don't have to purchase -- you don't have to pay taxes. I've known a lot of New Yorkers, and not many of them are that gullible.",
  "Well, I'm -- I'm not sure. Let's talk about the contraband cigarette trafficking. I'm not sure that these people would be in violation of it.

  "But there is no applicable State or local cigarette tax upon the shipment of these cigarettes.",
  "That's not what it says. It makes it unlawful to knowingly ship it when they bear no evidence of payment of applicable taxes, and - -",
  "-- there is no applicable taxes at the time that they ship it.",
  "Oh, I don't look at legislative history.",

I mean, at least for civil torts, you can -- there are a lot of cases where the landlord leaves out the bulb in the -- in the stairway and one of the residents gets mugged and he sues the landlord and wins, even though there is an intervening criminal act. Now, maybe what you want to argue is that that -- that has never been applied, to my knowledge, to either criminal liability or -- or penal provisions, and that maybe the -- an intervening criminal act does cut off causality, for purposes of penal statute, such as - - such as RICO. That would be a reasonable argument.",
  "You're not answering the question clearly. Are both the prosecutor, in Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, and the policeman liable? Can't you answer that? Yes or no.",
  "Good. That's what I thought your answer was.",
  "Well, she's more concerned about the prosecutor, and the prosecutor, also, would be treated just like a police officer?",
  "In the case?",
  "And how do you get the policeman who has fabricated the evidence?",
  "I don't know what you mean by that.",
  "The difference here is that the -- the absolutely immune act which follows the - - the unlawful act is -- is an absolutely immune act by the very actor who performed the earlier act that - - that you say induces liability. And so the argument is, what's the use of giving him liability later on if -- if you can simply drag him into litigation by -- by alleging that he at an earlier stage committed a violation?",
  "That's the difference. I mean, to me that's the -- the crux of this, that it is the same actor who has absolute liability whom you're trying to get on the basis of -- of earlier action.",
  "But it won't be protected. They won't have that assurance, because when they - - when they produce evidence at trial, oh, yeah, I guess the production at trial will be protected, but you're - - you're telling us that they can go back and say, ah, but you got that evidence in a bad manner, and therefore we can sue you, not for introducing it at trial, but for fabricating it before trial. I -- I don't see that there is much of a difference as far as the deterrent effect upon the prosecutor is concerned.",
  "What -- what does that prove? What does that prove? I don't understand why you bring that up because it shows that the fact that there aren't many cases, only 17 in the -- in the Second Circuit, it doesn't mean anything because the Second Circuit is not applying as liberal a rule as your opponent suggests. Is that - -",
  "Yes. That's -- that's just what I said, and, therefore -- and had it been applied that way, there would have been more than 17 cases in the Second Circuit.",
  "Okay.",
  "Of course, if they had introduced that evidence on behalf of the defendant, there would have come in the report they had gotten from -- who was it, Dr. Kirkland? Was that his name?",
  "Which said that, although he -- he indeed was in the lower range of mental agility, this did not affect his ability to discern right from wrong.",
  "He was not -- the Kirkland report was not a favorable report for the defendant.",
  "Well, but it didn't just say borderline intellectual function. It went on to say that did not affect his ability to perceive that he was -- he was doing something wrong here.",
  "You know, if it had not added that I would have said, oh, yeah, let's -- let's pursue this further. But they -- it seems to me they made an intelligent decision There was nothing here that was going to help them and there might be stuff that would hurt them.",
  "Can I -- can I suggest - - it doesn't seem to me there's any -- any contradiction between the two. (E)(1) addresses a factual finding. (D)(2), on the other hand, addresses the decision of the Court, which was based on, sometimes, just one factual finding, but, sometimes, many. So you -- you proceed, first, with (e)(1), and you -- you ask whether each factual finding on which the decision was based was shown by the defendant, either in the record, or if -- if you have an additional hearings, by new evidence, to be incorrect by clear and convincing evidence. You do that fact-by-fact. Having found, let's say, two of the five facts. To fail that test, you then go up to (d)(2) and say, okay, in light of the fact that two of the facts - - in light of the fact -- since two of the facts that the court relied on were false, was the decision vitiated by that reason, or was it nonetheless a reasonable determination? I mean, once you focus on the fact that (e)(1) applies to facts and (d)(2) applies to the decision, it's whether the decision was -- was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.",
  "No, no, no. It resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of facts.",
  "It focuses on the decision, whether the decision could have been reached - -",
  "-- without the use of any facts that had been found to be false.",
  "No sentence can be -- can be imposed rarely?",
  "When a sentence is imposed rarely, it becomes unconstitutional?",

  "It doesn't make it crueler to him. I don't see why it's any crueler to an adolescent than it is to -- what -- where do you draw the line? At 21?",
  "And so if it’s --",
  "So he -- he could sentence up to 1 year before the life expectancy of the -- of the person in prison? That -- that would be okay?",
  "Well, what's he supposed to do? How many years can he give --",
  "-- consecutive?",
  "There obviously does. What do you propose? I propose, you know, 1 year before his life expectancy.",
  "Oh, 1 year before life is also unconstitutional?",
  "Two years before life?",
  "I don't think -- the same kind of freedom that people on death row have? I --",
  "Aren't they released into the general population for exercise, for -- which I don't think death row inmates are.",
  "Well, I doubt whether this varies. I -- I don't know of any principle where if you are in for life, you are in solitary.",
  "You assume -- doesn't your argument assume that the only purpose of punishment is deterrence in the sense of protecting society from this person in the future, so that, you know, once that's no longer a problem, we should let this person out. But that isn't the only purpose of punishment that we've acknowledged. One of the purposes is retribution, punishment for just perfectly horrible actions. And I don't know why that value of retribution diminishes to the point of zero when it's a person who's, you know, 17 years 9 months old.",
  "Most States didn’t -- don't think so, or many States don't think so.",
  "Oh, sure, but you can make that claim in Florida courts, can't you?",
  "Can't you argue in Florida courts that this sentence is disproportionate and violates the Eighth Amendment, whereupon the Florida courts would have to decide? Wouldn't they have to decide that question?",
  "A line has to be drawn somewhere only if we accept your approach that there has to be a categorical exemption. A line does not have to be drawn somewhere if you adopt the approach of, case by case, decide whether this is proportional, given how old the individual was, given the nature of the crimes, and all of the other factors. You don't have to draw a line then, and that's the attraction of that approach.",
  "You mean the trial judge under Florida law does not have discretion to choose a lower sentence because of the -- of tender years of the defendant?",
  "What about historical perspective? I mean, you might appeal to the fact that at common law, which was in effect when the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause was adopted, 12 years was -- was viewed as the year when a -- when a person reaches the age of reason. And -- and the death penalty could not be inflicted on anyone --",
  "-- and all felonies were the death penalty.",
  "And then we apply a totality of the circumstances test --",
  "-- which means whatever seems -- seems like a good idea.",
  "I suppose you could say the same thing of -- of adults, of somebody over 18. You really can't tell how redeemable this individual is until he is in prison for some time; and, therefore, you should not give anybody life without parole. They -- they may all be savable. So we should defer -- defer. We shouldn't have any non-parole sentences. Everybody should be evaluated, which was indeed the approach that -- that many jurisdictions used to take. Wasn't that so --",
  "-- when there was parole for everybody?",
  "I guess there’s also no empiricism on whether the committed juvenile feels a lot better knowing that he will get out when he is 75 years old than he would feel knowing that he was there for life.",
  "Do we have empirical studies about how much that improves the spirits of the committed juvenile?",
  "Well, we are not sure that those 70-year sentences are any good, either, because your -- your friend on the other side, you know, is not willing to -- to pick a number at which the sentence amounts to life without parole. Maybe a 70-year sentence does.",
  "But Roper was decided under a regime, which I -- I think still exists, that death is different. How could it possibly be thought to apply to this case, which is not a death case?",
  "It said kids are different for purposes of the death penalty, which is different.",
  "No, no. The only Federal question in the case now -- or at least the preliminary Federal question, the threshold Federal question, is simply whether the State court was right about what Roper did. And if we agree with the State court about what Roper did, then the State's bar automatically applies and that's the end of the case.",
  "Oh, I don't -- I don't know about that. We -- is the argument here that, unless Roper mandates this result, you don't urge that the Constitution requires it? I don't think so.",
  "Well, that's true, but once we analyze the question, if we decide, as the trial court decided, that in fact Roper does not demand the result in this case and, therefore, there is no exception to the procedural bar of Florida, which makes an exception where the fundamental constitutional right asserted was not established within the period provided for, once we decide that in fact Roper didn't establish it, you're out of court, it seems to me. Then -- then, automatically, the -- the procedural bar of Florida applies.",
  "Did -- did you raise below your assertion that the exception -- that there is an exception for challenging -- for vacating sentences, that there is -- that that is an exception to the normal rule of 2 years’ limitation? Did you make that argument below?",
  "All you have established is that there is a consensus that that sentence should be rare, not a consensus that that sentence should not be available, because most States make it available.",
  "There are a lot of murderers who get life without parole. Not every murderer gets -- gets executed. So how can you say that these are worst of the worst? Murderers are the worst of the worst, and they get life without parole.",
  "Call them the \"worse of the worse\" maybe, but they are not the worst of the worst.",
  "It depends on how horrible the crime is that they've committed, doesn't it? But you say it doesn't. It doesn't depend upon how horrible it is and how much retribution society demands.",
  "This is non-homicide. Six --",
  "You are speaking too fast. I can't understand you.",
  "Wait. I -- I don't understand what he's saying. Can I understand this first? He's there for the homicide offense or for the non-homicide offense?",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "For the burglary, not for the --",
  "If I understand you correctly, you are saying he could lose here on the procedural bar, and then win later in the State courts. Is that right?",
  "Of course, the government says that the -- that the term on which it hangs its hat is the term “useful arts” and that that meant, originally, and still means manufacturing arts, arts dealing with workmen, with -- you know, inventors, like Lorenzo Jones, not -- not somebody who writes a book on how to win friends and influence people. What’s wrong with that analysis, that that's what \"useful arts\" meant, that it always -- always was thought to deal with machines and inventions?",
  "Even though the public can't use it, right, until the patent expires?",
  "You know, you mention that there are all these -- these new areas that didn't exist in the past because of modern business and whatnot, but there are also areas that existed in the past that don't exist today. Let's take training horses. Don't you think that -- that some people, horse whisperers or others, had some, you know, some insights into the best way to train horses? And that should have been patentable on your theory.",
  "Well, why didn't anybody patent those things?",
  "It was based on horses, for Pete's sake. You --",
  "You would really have thought somebody would have patented that.",
  "How old -- how old were those -- those cases?",
  "Well, it was -- it was transforming sound into electrical current and then at the other end electrical current back into sound. I mean it met the transformation test, didn't it?",
  "It clearly did.",
  "Sound -- sound is not physical, and electric current is not physical?",
  "Yes, I think so.",
  "Sound is, too.",
  "Sound is not transmitted over the wires. Sound has been transformed into current, and current is transmitted over the wire and then transformed back at the other end into sound.",
  "I think it clearly -- clearly would have been covered by -- by the test the government --",
  "I certainly hope so.",
  "Also you could say business methods apart from machines are not patentable. How about that?",
  "Well, why would we say that? Just because it wins your case and it solves your problem? I mean, it seems to me, to do that, you abandon your principal argument, which that -- which is that \"place\" doesn't mean \"State.\"",
  "And to talk about the whole State of California as the principal place of doing business -- I mean, if Congress meant that, it would have said, the principal State in which business is done.",
  "You don't want to throw away that good argument, do you?",
  "More than -- more than what, more than any other single State?",
  "But it doesn't say the - - the \"principal State of business.\" It's the \"principal place of business.\" Is there a difference between the two?",
  "I don't understand why, somehow, a Californian is more likely to identify with Hertz, simply because there are more Californians and, hence, more Hertz outlets, than a New Jerseyite is likely to identify with Hertz. Per capita, there are probably as many Hertz outlets in New Jersey as there are in California. The only reason that you come up with California is it's an enormous State. It has 10 percent of the population. But as far as the citizens of the State identifying with that -- with that company and, therefore, the unfairness of -- of letting that company -- you know, remove to Federal court, New Jersey and California are absolutely the same.",
  "Well, it is one of the factors in other -- in other states as well. It's part of the totality of the circumstances. You certainly increase your odds to move your headquarters.",
  "We don't worry about private individuals gaming the system, do we, by -- you know, in -- in order to get into or out of Federal court, establishing residence in a different State? We don't worry about them gaming the system, do we?",
  "Sure. But -- but you can have a genuine intent to go somewhere else, and I don't know that people do it for foreign reasons because they want to get in or out of Federal court. You really don't worry about that, it seems to me.",
  "I know some rich individuals that might have the incentive.",
  "That's a surprise.",
  "That means that its principal officers and their families have to move.",
  "That's the biggest disincentive it seems to me.",
  "How does that -- how does that read? I -- I recall the briefs say that, but I don't recall reading it. Is it -- does it appear somewhere?",
  "The -- the provision that -- that you contend provides the authority for the Attorney General's regulation.",
  "I know. Where is it, I'm asking? Is it -- is it in the briefs somewhere? You know, it's nice to know what we are talking about. When -- when you are relying on a section, it would be nice to have it in the materials. I mean, I guess I can send for it, but --",
  "So it really doesn't matter what \"under\" means, right? I mean, even -- even if you accept the other interpretation of \"under,\" to wit, that it includes regulations pursuant to the subchapter, your point is that this regulation is not even pursuant to the subchapter.",
  "I understand. Yes.",
  "Why -- why would it -- I don't -- the big obstacle I find with your position is that it doesn't make any sense. Why would Congress want to exclude review for discretionary judgments by the Attorney General that are recited explicitly to be discretionary in the statute, but provide judicial review for judgments that are just as lawfully discretionary because the Attorney General is given the authority to make them discretionary and has done so? I mean, a discretionary judgment is a discretionary judgment. Why -- at least if it's a legitimate one. I can understand why you would say discretion which is given to the Attorney General under the statute, as opposed to discretion which he has wrongfully assumed, but -- but both -- both exercises of discretion are just as lawful, right, under the statute? One is explicit in the statute, and the other is pursuant to the authority of the Attorney General to make it discretionary. Why would Congress want the one to be subject to judicial review and not the other?",
  "Yes, and I'm saying why is it a rational line to say -- I think it's a rational line to say, when lawful discretion is being exercised, since it's a discretionary judgment, you're not entitled to it anyway, and therefore, we won't review it. That makes some sense. And I -- but where discretion is lawfully exercised, why would -- why would Congress say, oh, when the discretion is lawfully exercised because the statute says so, we have one approach, but where discretion is lawfully exercised only because the statute allows the Attorney General to prescribe discretion, we will not allow it? I don't understand why -- why it would want to do that.",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, you -- you don't -- you don't contest that the regulation can provide discretion. You -- you don't say the regulation is invalid.",
  "So it is a valid exercise of discretion, right?",
  "Sure.",
  "Have they adhered -- have those other courts that you said originally said that other discretionary judgments made discretionary by regulation were non-reviewable, have they adhered to the -- to that view as to those other --",
  "Oh, I understand. I am asking: Have they treated motions to reopen differently?",
  "Has any of them, since switching to -- or since holding this with respect to motions to reopen, reaffirmed their view with regard to other discretionary judgments?",
  "Are you going to talk about \"under\"?",
  "Good.",
  "Where is this?",
  "Oh, 6a of the government's --",
  "Except that the text refers not just to the -- the discretion, it refers -- it says the authority for which is specified under this subchapter and the authority to issue that -- the authority to issue the regulation is under subchapter 1.",
  "No. You would have to say, no, Justice Scalia, if you want to win this.",
  "And, of course, if your interpretation produces the anomaly that Justice Breyer just described, the government's interpretation produces the opposite anomaly. Right?",
  "You said, earlier, that you had three examples --",
  "-- that were not in your brief. You better spit them out, or we won't know about them. What are the other two?",
  "1227(a)(1)(H). What’s the third one? And then I am going to ask you what the first one was because I forgot it.",
  "Yes. What was the first one? Just -- just give me the -- the cite for the first one. I didn't write it down. I should have.",
  "Thank you.",
  "But under your proposal a State that itself is guilty of fraud can, in effect, immunize -- if not immunize itself, at least render the information unusable by conducting a hearing.",
  "It would be a -- would it be a civil hearing? A deposition -- you would consider a deposition to be a civil hearing?",
  "What -- what provision would it come under?",
  "Documents are -- documents are a hearing?",
  "Meant more than hearing?",
  "That's an argument that doesn't go very far with me. I mean, \"hearing\" means hearing.",
  "Well, I think there would be a good lawsuit as to whether \"congressional report\" includes a GAO report. I think that's a lawsuit. I don't think it's at all as clear as you suggest.",
  "Yes, well, that argument does not scare the government. I think the government would like to read \"administrative hearing\" in the first -- in the first phrase as being limited to Federal administrative hearing as well.",
  "And that was on -- on the basis of the first, the first phrase rather than the second?",
  "Stars and Stripes, maybe.",
  "We should stop calling them clauses. They are really phrases.",
  "Phrases.",
  "Part of the random nature of the whole provision, right?",
  "Why -- why should we read the second category back to alter the meaning of the first, rather than reading the first phrase forward to alter the meaning of the second? It -- it is absolutely clear when you read this, \"in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing\"; there is no limitation to Federal on that. And you acknowledge that the criminal and civil apply to -- to State civil and criminal proceedings, right? So when you read that phrase, \"administrative\" simply means, obviously means State administrative. Now, why shouldn't I read that forward and say, well, since it means State there, it must mean State in the next one, in a congressional, administrative, or GAO report.",
  "You say that just as to administrative. Don't you acknowledge that the criminal and civil apply to State criminal and civil?",
  "You want the whole thing to be just Federal?",
  "The whole category?",
  "News media, they are likely to be keeping track of all local newspapers as well?",
  "I mean, they could have said \"national news media.\" It didn't say \"national news media.\" It said \"news media.\"",
  "It includes a local radio station, a local community newspaper, right? All of that is included.",
  "And yet, State proceedings, which are excluded, right?",
  "Even state supreme court cases and so forth. It seems strange to me.",
  "That doesn't show that it makes sense. It just shows that Congress wasn't thinking clearly. There's as difference between the two.",
  "Which decision of ours do you think would prompt Congress to go back and do this right? I mean, do you think that finding the way the government wants us to find will produce a revision of this really terrible text so that it makes sense; or do you think that finding for the other side, giving the government some incentive to get this fixed, would likely produce a proper amendment? What do you think? I think the latter, to tell you the truth.",
  "Could you be more specific when you say that Congress had in mind? Just so I know what you are talking about?",
  "The committee that reported the bill.",
  "In both houses or just one house?",
  "The House.",
  "Is the Justice Department seeking to get this -- this piece of -- of statutory text clarified? I mean, you do have some operation over there that proposes to Congress amendments of those provisions that are not working out well. Is there - - is there any effort to get this clarified?",
  "Could it make it worse?",
  "Of course, the Attorney General can always bring suit, right? I mean, all we are arguing about is whether this information that is in the in the State and local thing could be the basis of a qui tam suit.",
  "If the government finds out about it, the Attorney General could always bring suit, right?",
  "When we say everybody's working in a certain context, how -- how many people is everybody? What percentage of the House and of the Senate were involved in these committees that were drafting these bills and that issued the committee report?",
  "But what your claim is - - is that the government -- the Federal government is not the only person harmed?",
  "And, therefore -- you know, we should listen to them, so long as they don't -- they want to come out this way, you are saying the State and local governments - -",
  "-- are significantly harmed.",
  "Which the Federal government doesn't care about, right?",
  "But you want to go beyond constructive discovery?",
  "Well, I think there’s a line between constructive discovery -- constructive discovery asks, when should you have known? And the rule you are arguing for is something beyond that.",
  "Under your rule, what happens when you are put on inquiry notice? That's the point at which you should be conducting additional investigation, right?",
  "And that's where the -- statute begins to run, at the point when you should have conducted additional investigation?",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay.",
  "All right.",
  "Well, excuse me. To --",
  "To say that, you must believe that there is substantial evidence of fraud when there is simply substantial evidence of inaccuracy, without --",
  "-- without any evidence of scienter. What evidence of scienter was there?",
  "Well, but deliberate wrongdoing -- as I understood that, it was simply you didn't give adequate weight to the -- to the other -- to the other side of it.",
  "That means it's -- that means it's wrong. You can misrepresent something without having scienter to defraud.",
  "Mr. Shanmugam, in Lampf we -- we had to choose between what statute of limitations provision, Federal one, we thought applied. And we had two choices: One was section 77m, which reads: “After such discovery” -- \"after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence.\" That was one choice. The other choice was 78i(e), which simply said: \"unless brought within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation.” No statement of \"or after it should have been made by the exercise,\" okay? We chose the latter in Lampf. Now, you are telling me that there was no choice between the two, that -- that \"after discovery\" always means after discovery was made or after it should have been made? What were we doing in Lampf, spinning our wheels?",
  "I mean, I read this -- this statute -- and 1658 tracks, not 77m, which says \"after discovery should have been made\"; it tracks 78i(e), which says \"after discovery.\" Now, to me that means after discovery, period.",
  "Well, just tell me what the difference it was between 77m and 77i(e)?",
  "What was the difference, unless it was that 77m -- I'm sorry, 78i(e) -- absolutely required knowledge?",
  "So there was no difference between the two --",
  "-- and we were just wasting our time?",
  "Well, you're adding -- you’re adding concepts to it, as well. Nobody arguing before us intends discovery to mean actual discovery. Your -- you say constructive knowledge is enough; don't you?",
  "That doesn't prove scienter, though.",
  "Wait. It doesn't mean is it likely. \"In contemplation of\" means that the reason you are doing this is the contemplated bankruptcy. You don't see any causal connection in that phrase?",
  "Well, that's true. That may be true enough. But -- but the act must be taken because you are about to file a bankruptcy petition.",
  "That's a different question.",
  "What if you leave \"abusive\" out. Let's accept your point that \"abusive\" is not there and the government is reading in out of nowhere. What's -- what's the matter with the statute then?",
  "It just prohibits giving advice in contemplation of bankruptcy that somebody incur more debt. What's unlawful about that?",
  "But that's not in contemplation of bankruptcy.",
  "If the only reason the lawyer gives the advice is because he knows that this - - that this debtor is planning to file bankruptcy, he says, if you are going to file bankruptcy, you better sell the house and move to an apartment, then it's no good. Now, it may be a stupid law, but I don't see why it's -- why it's unconstitutional.",
  "So it's a stupid law.",
  "Exactly. And that's why it's a stupid law.",
  "Now, where is the prohibition of stupid laws in the Constitution?",
  "It's only lawyers who are protected against vague criminal statutes?",
  "So then -- so then there is no reason in particular to take lawyers out of it just to make it constitutional.",
  "That's fine. If you -- if you are letting that argument stand on its own, that's a fine argument. But don't -- don't bring in the fact that, well then, moreover, if it's applied to attorneys, it's unconstitutional, because if it's applied to anybody it's unconstitutional according to your argument.",
  "This is a proposal for a commercial transaction, right? You are trying to get a consumer to hire you. And the First Amendment standards for proposals for commercial transactions have always been more -- more lenient than other First Amendment contexts. We -- we -- we regulate the content of advertising all the time.",
  "I don't know - -",
  "If indeed \"in contemplation of bankruptcy\" means, as -- as you argue, that it has to be for the purpose of abusing the Bankruptcy Code - - right? If that's true, then aren't all these vagueness arguments irrelevant, because it would be illegal anyway, wouldn't it?",
  "So even without this statute, the lawyer would have to worry about -- about whether he's doing something that is unlawful.",
  "The lawyer runs that risk anyway, whether this statute applies or not. He has - - he has to decide whether what he is doing is a fraud on creditors.",
  "If they're -- if they're, as the hypothetical suggests, representing only big companies, they're probably not advertising to the general public anyway.",
  "I don't read the hypothetical that you have given as coming within the statute. I think what -- what it means: Incurred debt to pay an attorney, I don't think it means debt to the attorney. You are not worried about the attorney cheating himself.",
  "Making himself an additional creditor. That's ridiculous.",
  "What it talks about is inducing the client to -- to borrow money from somebody else to pay the attorney. You know, and that seems to be perfectly reasonable.",
  "That's right.",
  "Why -- why would you worry about the attorney, you know, hurting himself?",
  "It makes no sense.",
  "Only -- only -- only if the bankruptcy court disregards the law. I mean, it's -- it's clear that the bankruptcy court should not have done what it did here. The only issue is, it having made that mistake, can it -- can it subsequently be -- be undone in the manner that's -- that's sought here? They haven't reduced three to two. The three -- the three remain three. The bankruptcy court should not do this.",
  "There are a lot of commas. What comma are you referring to?",
  "Where is (c)? You have been talking about 523(c). I can't find it in any of the materials.",
  "Why don't you put it in an appendix if it's going to be part of your case? I’ve got to search through your brief for it? What page in your brief?",
  "Don't bankruptcy courts read the law?",
  "So you’ve got to assume that every bankruptcy court is going to violate the provisions of the statute.",
  "Why, of course, they are supposed to police --",
  "Do you acknowledge that what the bankruptcy court did here was wrong? Do you acknowledge that?",
  "Okay. And it should not have done it, and future bankruptcy courts shouldn't do it?",
  "It makes a big difference to how I’m going to look on this case. I mean, if you –-",
  "Is it -- is it easy for a bankruptcy judge to identify a particular debt as a student loan debt? I mean, would the bankruptcy filing -- filing show it -- you know, student loan debt?",
  "It would?",
  "Yes.",
  "That -- that's not enough for me, that it's not improper for him to do it. I want you to say that that is what he ought to do.",
  "And you’re not willing to say that. You’re willing to say that bankruptcy courts can do that if they like, but, you know, if they have a kid that has a lot of bankruptcy debts, he has a soft heart for student loan debts, he sees this as a student loan debt, all right, let's give this kid a break. And he enters -- that's okay?",
  "So you would say it's wrong for the bankruptcy court to do it without a waiver, and -- but you’re leaving open if there is a clear waiver, despite the fact of no adversary proceeding -- you’re not -- you’re not necessarily willing to say that the bankruptcy court can't do that?",
  "If that’s the price of your winning this case, it's clearly worth it now -- agreeing with Justice Breyer on that point.",
  "Yes. I mean, if indeed the Court would not be willing to go along with -- with your assertion that you can't undo it later, once it's been done, unless it is clear that it should not be done and that the bankruptcy judge shouldn't do it, and that a lawyer shouldn't propose it -- if that's the condition, then you should accept it, right? Because you want to win this case --",
  "I guess I don't understand your position, because I thought you had said that this should not have been discharged and now -- now you’ve answered to Justice Ginsburg that so long as the -- as the creditor appears they can all be discharged. Now, which is it?",
  "Even if the creditor appears, it shouldn't be discharged. I thought that that's what you had said before. But now you are saying that so long as a creditor appears, all of these are dischargeable.",
  "Which is it?",
  "Well, they're -- they're eliminated -- at least the right of contact with the water can be eliminated by an avulsion, right? When there's -- when there's avulsion, even at common law and under Florida law, it -- it can happen that some land between the property owner and -- and the water will be owned by the State.",
  "Well, why wasn't this an avulsion?",
  "Well, well, well, well. There were -- there were two avulsions. One was the avulsion of its being washed away and the other was the -- the rapid replacement of sand. That -- that is not a natural, gradual phenomenon.",
  "If there’s no case law, it seems to me you've lost your case.",
  "Well, you can have quiet hot dog stands during the daytime.",
  "Of course, such -- such boats floating in -- in the water below the mean high­ water mark are available with respect to all littoral properties. Isn't that right?",
  "But what can't happen with other littoral property is that folks can't come in and lay down beach blankets and occupy that sand, right, so that you have open sand in front of -- in front of your house?",
  "And people pay a lot more money for beach -- beachfront homes, for that reason, don't they?",
  "And that's quite different from having a house behind the beach at Coney Island, isn't it?",
  "The State gave you some quid pro quo for this, which is to say this new sand is projected to last 6 years, has to be replaced regularly, because your -- your property is being eroded, which is the reason the State went into this. And what the State has given you in exchange is that if and when there is further erosion, you will continue to own up to whatever this new line is called.",
  "The ECL. You will continue to -- to own up to there, despite the fact that under common law when there's more erosion, your -- your line would recede to the new mean high-water mark. So, you know, who -- who knows? Maybe that's sufficient compensation. You know, if you go in and ask for compensation, the State might say, you know, we've given them -- given them this property right in exchange, and the difference between that and what they have now is two dollars.",
  "Did any of these beachfront owners think this was a good deal, that the State has prevented further erosion of their land and, you know, the price they pay for that is that they have this 60-foot stretch that -- that the public can use, and that may wash away in 6 years anyway, and if they're lucky the State won't have enough money to put it back? Or --",
  "Did anybody -- I'm not sure it's a bad deal. And they're guaranteed against -- against further loss of property because they will continue to own up to that -- to that new line, even if it's all covered by water.",
  "Nobody -- nobody thought it was a good deal? Everybody thought that they had been done out of something?",
  "Petitioner's members, but other people along -- along the same coast? I mean, if I had a place and it's being -- it’s being eroded by hurricanes constantly, you know, I -- I'm not sure whether I wouldn't -- wouldn’t want to have the sand replaced, even at the -- at the cost of having a 60-foot stretch that the State owns.",
  "It may not change the property line, but all of your property might be under water --",
  "-- right? That wouldn't be very good.",
  "Well, your members were, but I was asking whether some other people might not have thought it was a pretty good deal.",
  "I thought Martin was -- the Martin case was -- was pretty close, the lake that -- that the State lowered.",
  "Right.",
  "Did the -- did the Florida Supreme Court cite it?",
  "Isn't that weird? Why didn't they cite it?",
  "Do you think that's true?",
  "I know they said that. Do you think that's true? When I read it, it seemed to me to deal with reliction precisely.",
  "A good lawyerly response.",
  "Why is that? I thought avulsion by definition is a sudden change.",
  "Why -- you're -- we're wandering off the point. Why wasn't it an avulsion? It was an avulsion in that case, wasn't it, because it was sudden?",
  "Is -- is --",
  "You have a case for the proposition that an -- what would otherwise be an avulsion is an accretion if it's done by the State?",
  "Or vice versa. What would otherwise be an accretion is an avulsion if done by the State?",
  "Right.",
  "What if it is?",
  "Sand Key's statement strikes one as -- as correct simply because I think that's -- that's the view of the common law. I -- I don't think that's unique or distinctive to Florida. I think it would be very strange to have a principle that all the -- all the littoral owner gets is a right to access the water and not the right to be on the water, to have his property on the water. I think -- I think in every State, beachfront owners would be astounded to learn that that's the case. So, I -- you know, I thought that Sand Key was just expressing what -- what was the common law. And the notion that -- that the only purpose of the contact with the water is so that you can have access, that is -- is that not silly?",
  "Would that person still be considered a littoral owner?",
  "After there has been the avulsive event that separates him from the ocean by 60 feet of State-owned land, would he still be a -- a riparian owner? I thought --",
  "He's not talking about the Act. He's just talking about your theory of the case. Your theory of what the rights of beachfront owners consist of would permit this to happen, if not under this Act, under some other act, right?",
  "Right. Well, it's the Spring Break Act of 2010, okay?",
  "They could do that, couldn't they?",
  "Under your theory of the case?",
  "You won't disagree with that.",
  "No, no, no --",
  "They wouldn't own to the mean high-water mark if there were an avulsion, if -- right? If --",
  "If by nature, this 60-foot beach had been put in, then their deed would be changed, wouldn't it?",
  "You shovel away the sand.",
  "What if it's going the opposite way? What if it's -- if they built up sand? I mean --",
  "Yes.",
  "They can go on the State land to do that? Because that sand is sitting on State land.",
  "Are the Florida Supreme Court elected? Are they elected judges?",
  "Are they elected judges, the Florida Supreme Court?",
  "How -- how long is their term? There’s a retention election when?",
  "Every 4 years. And they'd have to run for their retention election on the ticket that \"We've expanded Miranda for Florida purposes,\" right?",
  "It told them: You are entitled to confer with counsel before answering questions, right?",
  "Wasn't that -- wasn't that the warning given -- given in this case? You are entitled to consult counsel before answering questions?",
  "Well, once we say this is properly given, my goodness, here's -- here's an instruction approved specifically by this Court. I mean, I think they should use that, don't you? I mean, the other one they are going to have to guess about, but this one is approved in a case involving Florida by this Court. So you -- it's pretty attractive to use that one.",
  "Well, you have to say it's okay. You are arguing that it's perfectly okay, so why do you hesitate when you are asked, you know, could the State go back to doing it? You should say, yes, of course, they -- they might; we don't think it's likely, but they might, and if they did, it's perfectly okay. Isn't that your position?",
  "It's not your position?",
  "And the Constitution requires it, right?",
  "Well, Miranda supposedly says the Constitution requires this warning, and if the warning must be in a standard form that everybody uses, the Constitution must require a standard form that everybody uses.",
  "It set forth the substance of what had to be conveyed --",
  "-- but it set forth, on page 484, its belief that the FBI warning adequately conveyed that substance. It said this warning is consistent with our opinion today. And -- and that warning said --",
  "You want to read it?",
  "Good.",
  "Well, I mean, that’s so much worse than -- than --",
  "-- what you have here.",
  "This Court said in Miranda --",
  "Yes.",
  "But I must say I -- this is –- this is angels dancing on the head of a pin. You want us to believe that your client, who decided to talk, even though he was told he could consult an attorney before any question was asked, and he could consult an attorney at any time during the interview, and he went ahead and -- and confessed -- you are saying, oh, if he had only known. Oh, if I knew that I could have an attorney present during the interview, well, that would have been a different kettle of fish and I would never have confessed. I mean, doesn't that seem to you quite fantastic?",
  "I'm curious: When this goes back to them, do you think they can deviate? They were answering a certified question, which was simply whether this -- this warning complied with Miranda. That was the only certified question. So when it goes back, I assume they, having said no, will now have to say yes. Can they go on and say: Oh, and by the way, even though it doesn't violate Miranda, we think it violates the State Constitution?",
  "Well, but that --",
  "But that wasn't the question asked of them. The only question asked of them was whether it complied with Miranda.",
  "Well, the question asked: Does the failure to provide express advice of the right to the presence of counsel during questioning vitiate Miranda warnings? Okay? That's the question. They have a footnote after Miranda, which reads, “Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436.” I take that to mean that the question is whether this warning violated Miranda.",
  "Right.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Well, that's true, but -- but if they -- if they felt the authority to go beyond Miranda, wouldn't they have had to say no to this question, if we find that way, and then go on to say: But it does violate our own? And that's beyond the question that they -- that they -- that was certified to them.",
  "Right. I --",
  "Sometimes, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.",
  "When you say \"no existing mechanism,\" could the SEC adopt a rule that would give the SEC authority to -- to stop it?",
  "Well, I’m --",
  "I'm not sure that's the main point. I think the main -- the main point is whether the FCC could stop it -- the SEC could stop it if it wanted to.",
  "Never mind \"Right now, it cannot.\" If it issued a rule that said you need our approval --",
  "It cannot issue such a rule?",
  "Why not?",
  "Well, why -- why isn't this simply relieving the board of responsibility, saying, you no longer have responsibility for -- for investigation and inspection in these areas?",
  "They could do that, couldn't they?",
  "Well, let's talk about whether it can't or not. Why can't it?",
  "Don't -- don't you think that's what it means, though, realistically?",
  "When you no longer have responsibility to perform a government -- governmental act, you no longer have authority to perform it.",
  "I don't think the government will think it has achieved a great victory if it comes out of this with the proposition that the SEC is not an independent regulatory agency. And I don't think the government is arguing that position.",
  "\"For cause\" doesn't mean for failure to obey the President's instructions, does it?",
  "That's why it's called an independent regulatory agency, because it's not subject to presidential control.",
  "I’d love to say that. That would be wonderful.",
  "This is not an argument you have made anyway. Can we go on to the arguments that you’ve made?",
  "Thank you.",
  "I hope your case doesn't rest on Freytag.",
  "I don't understand that. It's okay for them to appoint principal officers, but not inferior officers?",
  "Oh. Oh, I see.",
  "I wish you had said that. You really had me scared there.",
  "You’re saying they are not inferior officers and also not principal officers, but merely employees?",
  "And who appoints -- who appoints the inferior officers at the -- at the SEC?",
  "All those appointments are presumably invalid.",
  "That would be a shame.",
  "Excuse me. The President has adequate control over the SEC only because he can dismiss the chairman of the SEC. But the activity here is not governed by the chairman of the SEC. There’s no role whatever for the chairmanship. The -- the governance of this board is by the members of the SEC. So that's quite different from saying -- you know, I -- I think your syllogism breaks down at that point.",
  "The chairman, which is -- which is -- which is the -- what should I say -- the knife that the President has into the SEC, has no role in the control of this board.",
  "Excuse me, but, you know, Congress -- Congress can change the statutory authority of any agency just like that. Does that mean that Congress is controlling the agency?",
  "I'm not sure that -- that the ability to take away responsibility for an agency -- from an agency is the same as controlling what authority that agency does exercise. It seems to me they are two different things.",
  "No, that’s --",
  "But that's not true. He can remove -- he can remove the chairman of the SEC.",
  "And he cannot -- he cannot remove the commissioners. And it's the commissioners that govern the board, not the chairman.",
  "Would you please change it? Right?",
  "I could do that.",
  "I did, I did.",
  "We did overrule it, by the way, in -- in Morrison, didn't we?",
  "General Kagan, the government argues here that the head of department is all of the commissioners. Elsewhere, it is the chairman of the SEC who -- who appoints inferior officers. Now, which is it? Are all those appointments by the chairman invalid?",
  "Well, that's something quite different. He makes the appointments. They can overturn it, but the appointment must be made by the head of the department, and the appointments are not made by the commissioners. They are made by the chairman.",
  "Do you know any other agency composed of inferior officers that has the power to acquire its own budget, as this board does, by simply assessing a tax upon the people that it regulates?",
  "The SEC can overturn it, but it's up to the board -- the board can do it. Do you know of any parallel situation where there is a, supposedly, agency composed of inferior officers who have the power to tax the public unless it's overturned by somebody else?",
  "But you can say the same -- you can say the same thing about Congress. I mean, this is not the kind of control that an executive officer normally is supposed to have over inferior officers; when they do something, you can take away their authority. Congress can do that.",
  "Which is nothing, which is nothing.",
  "I -- when I was OLC, I would -- I advised the President, you can't interfere with -- I think, if the President called up the FCC and said, I want you to rule this way, I want this kind of a rule from the FCC, I think there would be an impeachment motion in Congress.",
  "Congress set up that agency to be independent from the President. That was the whole purpose of it, wasn't it?",
  "But it's okay for him to ask them? It's okay for him to suggest to an independent regulatory agency that this is how he wants something done?",
  "Do you know of any instance where that has happened?",
  "But what does the Treasury Department tell the SEC to do?",
  "It takes the initiative? The SEC doesn't request that information?",
  "The SEC does not request that information; the Treasury Department just butts in? Is that it?",
  "I understand, but --",
  "I understand, but --",
  "It's one thing for the SEC to ask the Treasury Department's view. It's another for the Treasury Department to butt in. Does it butt in?",
  "Say it again --",
  "We don't assume that they –-",
  "That's what the statute says.",
  "That's what the statute says.",
  "It says \"honest services.\"",
  "Excuse me. I have been trying to find out what you were referring to on pages 68 to 69.",
  "Yes.",
  "Why didn't Congress say that instead of -- instead of -- of setting up this mush of language that doesn't even mention McNally, does not use a phrase that any opinion pre-McNally used? That -- that phrase does not appear, as I understand, it in any of the cases.",
  "What is a citizen supposed to do? He’s supposed to go back and read all those pre-McNally cases?",
  "Why would it have been so difficult for Congress to say no bribes, no kickbacks, and -- and -- and the third thing, however you want to describe it?",
  "I mean, I think it's -- if -- if -- if you have a -- a principle that the citizen is supposed to know when he’s violating a criminal statute, this is -- I mean, it is just too much.",
  "Number one, I am -- I am not going to draw any generalities from the civil rights statutes. I mean, this is an area unto itself, and, number two, the Sherman Act explicitly -- \"explicitly\" -- clearly confers upon courts a common law, a common law ability to define the crime. And that doesn't appear from this statute.",
  "There’s no such thing as a vague law, so long as this Court says, oh, what the law -- the law -- it’s absolutely unclear what the law means, so long as this Court says, oh, we think the law means -- what do you want to pick -- bribery, then -- then it's okay. Right?",
  "Is that the system we have, that Congress can say, nobody shall do any bad things?",
  "And it comes to this Court, and this Court says, bad things means bribery. And that law is a valid law, right?",
  "The principle that you’re arguing for, that -- that a law that is, on its face, inherently vague can somehow be rendered valid to the citizens by a decision of this Court?",
  "Well, you say it was a body of law. It wasn't about a body of law. We said it was wrong. So Congress is not here referring to some established common law crimes at all. It's referring to a mistaken series of decisions by the courts of appeals.",
  "And that's quite different from -- from harking back to a common law term, such as fraud.",
  "But it's -- it's not -- it's not just one. One of the briefs in one or the other of these cases describes the great variety of “pushing the envelope” prosecutions that the Justice Department has, indeed, pursued, and they are all over the place. And if the Justice Department can't figure out what -- what is embraced by this statute, I don't know how you can expect the average citizen to figure it out.",
  "I have one --",
  "You -- you say he violated State law? I -- I thought that the -- that the court found that he didn't. You say he violated State law when he voted.",
  "I thought they -- I thought it was accepted in this case that -- that there was no violation of Alaska law.",
  "I -- I see.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, even --",
  "Even after he discloses he still couldn't vote that way, so he's supposed to vote against it even though he thinks it's a good thing for the State to do?",
  "You -- you don't ask for the first, do you?",
  "The problem with the bribe or kickback explanation, unlike -- or you contend, unlike yours, is that there's no basis in the statute for limiting it to that.",
  "I mean, we -- we can't find a statute that says, \"No person shall commit a bad act.\" We can't find that to be non-vague as applied to murder. Everybody knows that murder is a bad act. Would that - - would that law be constitutional?",
  "Mr. Estrada, let -- let me pursue the notion I -- I floated earlier, that the problem with Professor Altshuler's approach is that there is nothing in the text of the statute that would enable you to limit it to kickbacks and -- and bribes. Is there anything in the text of the statute that makes your proposal any better? I mean, to be sure, it does -- it does make this a kind of fraud, and in the past, fraud did require injury to somebody. But it defined a new kind of fraud, namely, fraud that consists of the deprivation of honest services. That's the fraud. That, in and of itself, under the text of the statute, I take to be the fraud.",
  "What if -- what if I think that even -- I mean, much of your case is directed to the point that you -- you have to narrow it this way to avoid constitutional problems. What if I think you don't avoid constitutional problems?",
  "Why should -- why should I turn somersaults to -- to come out with the -- with the interpretation that you want?",
  "Now, what about - -",
  "But I don't -- I don't have the heart to inquire into that question if I think that the whole statute is bad. And that's the point he is raising, that it's -- it's a predicate to our considering that question, that if you agree with him, you think the statute will be sustained. But if I think the whole statute is bad, what -- you know, why should I engage in -- in this exercise?",
  "It doesn't make any sense to make me do that.",
  "Well, just -- just so we - - we know what is -- what is going on here: It is not the case that the Petitioner here has said here that if we adopt his interpretation, it will render the statute constitutional. He doesn't say that. He says that if we adopt his interpretation, we can avoid reaching the constitutional question, because whether it's constitutional or not, it at least requires the -- the kind of financial harm that -- that he asserts. So he is not asserting that if we -- if we accept his position, the statute is constitutional. I don't read his brief as saying that, anyway.",
  "What is -- I mean, I'm still waiting to hear what materiality consists. It is just -- de minimus doesn't count? Is that all you mean?",
  "Excuse me - -",
  "But it -- it doesn't answer the racing form case. I mean, you are using materiality in two senses. All you mean by materiality is that the misrepresentation must have been material, okay? So in the racing form case, let's say the question the boss asked is, you know, \"Are you going to work hard this afternoon? Or do I have to stand here and look over your shoulder? \" And he says, \"Boss, I'm going to work hard this afternoon. \" \"Okay, then I'll leave.\" And the boss leaves. That representation is material in that it got the boss to leave, whereupon he reads the racing form. But you know, that's immaterial in another sense, it's a -- it's not a substantial crime. And that's -- that's what we are looking for here, something that -- that separates reading the racing form from really harming the employer - -",
  "-- to a substantial degree. And you have nothing in your -- in your brief or in your argument that eliminates these de minimus kind of - - what should I say - -",
  "Misrepresentations to the employer.",
  "What if my son gets the money? I don't get the money. My son does.",
  "It's an adult son.",
  "And that -- that is how a lawyer is supposed to advise his client. He says, well, what this means is the core of pre-McNally cases.",
  "And he -- and he sends him off to read the pre-McNally cases. And I have to tell you, they are a mess, I don't understand them at all. It's one of the reasons McNally came out the way it did. Is -- you speak as though it is up to us to write the statute. We can make it mean whatever it - - you know, whatever would -- would save it or whatever we think is a good idea, but that's not our job. What -- what does the statute say? And, if all it does is refer us to the pre-McNally cases, I'm at -- I'm at sea.",
  "Maybe it was wrong. Just because it understood it had a consistent core, it has a consistent -- consistent core?",
  "But that's the same before courts. That's no different. I mean, yes, a court has to come to a decision, but so does an arbitrator. And I really -- I really don't understand what it means to say that the contract does not cover it. I mean, the -- the contract either requires it or does not require it. And if the contract is silent, either the court or the arbitrator has to decide what is the consequence of that silence, in light of the background, in light of -- of implied understandings. Is the consequence of the -- of the silence that a class arbitration is permitted, or is the consequence of the silence that it is not? But those are the only answers. The contract requires it or the contract doesn't require it. I don't know anything in between -- the contract is silent. If the contract is silent, it's up to the court or the arbitrator to decide what that silence means.",
  "Do I have to agree with Judge Posner on that? I mean I -- I don't --",
  "You would -- yes, you --",
  "But --",
  "Mr. Waxman, I hope you are going to have time to go through (a), (b), and (c) --",
  "-- as you started to do.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Yes, I bet you were thinking you'd be able to.",
  "Where -- where -- where do they say that they were interpreting the intent of the parties, that it was the intent of the parties to permit class arbitration?",
  "Excuse me, what part -- 50?",
  "I thought you said 59a to start.",
  "You said 49a.",
  "Right.",
  "Or to preclude.",
  "Right.",
  "It -- it seems to me that the arbitrators are putting the choice in a false manner. It isn't whether, on the one hand, they agreed to permit it or, on the other hand, they agreed to prohibit it. Just forget about the latter. They must have agreed to permit it. Where did the arbitrators say they agreed -- they agreed to permit it? Not simply, they did not agree to prohibit it. You don't have to agree to prohibit everything in a contract. You have to agree to permit it. That's what contracting is about.",
  "Well, no, I mean, they -- they put it just -- just the way that -- that is not good for you. \"The panel is struck by the fact that Respondents have been unable to cite any post-Bazzle panels or arbitrators that construed their clauses as prohibiting a class action.\" That's not what -- what they have to find. They must find positively that it permits a class action.",
  "Just give me some language that says that. I -- there is nothing in that paragraph that says it.",
  "So the only language you can point to is that -- is that \"any dispute\" language on 50a?",
  "You are hanging your whole -- your whole assertion that -- that these arbitrators not only found that the contract did not prohibit it, but found that the contract positively authorized class action, upon that language on 50a?",
  "Where -- where --",
  "\"Clear language\" is the point of that sentence. \"Claimants argue that Bazzle requires clear language that forbids class arbitration. The panel, however, agrees with Respondents that the test is a more general one. Arbitrators must look to the language to ascertain the parties' intention whether they intended to permit or to preclude class action.”",
  "The point of those two sentences is simply that in order for us to find that you didn't preclude it -- and if you didn't preclude it, it's okay -- you don't need clear language. We have to look to everything.",
  "Well, that's how I read the two sentences.",
  "I used to teach contracts. Did you know that?",
  "I used to teach contracts.",
  "What page?",
  "May I -- you know, that doesn't help me a lot. What does it mean, if it permits it? I mean, I guess you could say, if there's a background rule, that whether the parties agree to it or not, it's okay. Does “permits it” mean “authorizes it”? Does -- does that mean whether the parties have agreed to it? Is that what “permits” mean there?",
  "What page -- what page are you quoting from?",
  "Not in this industry, however.",
  "Yes.",
  "Bear what risk?",
  "Bear what risk? What risk? Bear what risk?",
  "Well, he says, \"Is this your lab report and do you stand by it?\"",
  "Oh, I see. So -- okay.",
  "Yes. I understood the hypothetical to be -- to be otherwise, then.",
  "Right.",
  "I don't understand what you just said. Want to say it again?",
  "Mr. Friedman, aren't there States that have been proceeding this way even before we came down with our opinion?",
  "And which States are they?",
  "And they are not under water, are they?",
  "What was that adjective? I like that.",
  "Orthogonal?",
  "Ooh.",
  "I think we should use that in the opinion.",
  "They're trial witnesses. Anything else?",
  "No, just one or two. Just one or two affidavits. Or it -- the court has a rule you have to provide those affidavits several weeks before trial. That would be okay?",
  "We'd have a whole European-type trial, right? It would be trial by affidavit.",
  "It does more than that. It does more than that. It is the prosecution that has had to place the witness on the stand. It has not been up to the defense to say, oh, no, I object to this affidavit, I would like you to bring -- no. The prosecution has to bring in the witness. That has been what the Confrontation Clause has meant.",
  "No, you don't agree with that. You say you don't have to do it unless the defendant objects and issue -- gets a subpoena issued.",
  "How is that clear from the statute?",
  "How is that clear from the statute? It just says that a subpoena shall issue. What if a subpoena issues and nobody comes?",
  "A strict construction of statutes in general, or a strict construction of this provision?",
  "I'm talking about the specific issue of the person subpoenaed not appearing. Do you have a case?",
  "So we don't really know.",
  "I don't know how -- how strict construction gets you to the -- to the result that when it is the defendant who has to take the initiative to get the person brought in, if the person doesn't show up, it's -- it doesn't fall on the defendant; it falls on the prosecution. I don't see how strict construction gets you there.",
  "Well, the problem you describe, the hearsay rule would have solved that alone, wouldn't it?",
  "So -- so what's left for the Confrontation Clause to do?",
  "And it's still not clear -- not clear under the statute that if the witness doesn't show up, it's the prosecution that bears the burden.",
  "Why is that clear?",
  "It doesn't say what the consequence of his not appearing is. That the -- that the written testimony is -- stands and is admitted, without the opportunity to cross-examine the witness?",
  "No, the prosecutor issues the subpoena.",
  "The witness does not show up.",
  "I'm not talking about fault on the part of the prosecutor. I'm talking about the fact that the witness has died, has fled the State, is simply not available.",
  "Of course, he is required to appear. But what happens if he doesn't appear?",
  "No, we’re not going in circles at all. You -- you appeal to the language that the witness shall appear as resolving what happens when he doesn't, and it doesn't resolve that. It just says he must appear. And if he doesn't appear, what happens?",
  "Well, I don't see the statute requiring that. It requires that of the witness, he shall appear.",
  "How new is the new one?",
  "Okay. The -- the reply brief of -- of the Petitioners mentions that -- that the same thing, a spike occurred in other jurisdictions after Melendez-Diaz, but then the spike went down, after -- after 6 months or a short period.",
  "What is peculiar about Virginia that -- or what is peculiar about Michigan or the other States that have this system and somehow are able to live with it?",
  "Virginia criminals are nastier; is that it?",
  "Right.",
  "That's not what we said in Melendez-Diaz, unfortunately.",
  "We said the following: “More fundamentally, the Confrontation Clause imposes a burden on the prosecution to present its witnesses, not on the defendant to bring those adverse witnesses into court. Its value to the defendant is not replaced by a system in which the prosecution presents its evidence via ex parte affidavits and waits for the defendant to subpoena the affiants, if he chooses.” So you are asking us to overrule that -- that statement?",
  "He's present only if the defendant asks for him, right?",
  "And that's exactly what this addressed. It's not -- it's not replaced by a system in which the prosecution presents its evidence by -- and waits for the defendant to subpoena the affiants if he chooses.",
  "That may be. It's a perfectly reasonable argument. I just object to your saying that it doesn't contradict Melendez-Diaz.",
  "And it just doesn't -- doesn't apply just to analysts, right? I mean, is there anything peculiar about analysts? Would it not exist for any other witness?",
  "Okay.",
  "I don't understand what -- is that a yes or a no?",
  "Okay. So as far as the Confrontation Clause is concerned, this would apply to other witnesses as well?",
  "Indicia of reliability -- you want us to go back to that? Is that --",
  "Well, how many hundreds of cases will it take to identify those limits under that very clear Due Process Clause?",
  "Don't we want clear rules for the presentation? Don't we want clear rules, not gambling on what the Supreme Court will say about due process?",
  "Why -- why do we have to say anything in this case? Why is this case here except as an opportunity to upset Melendez-Diaz?",
  "This Virginia statute no longer exists, does it? So we are pronouncing on the validity of a Virginia statute that is now gone, right? They have adopted a statute that complies completely with Melendez-Diaz.",
  "I'm not criticizing Virginia; I'm criticizing us for taking the case.",
  "That question of prior State law, right?",
  "But how much -- how much did the Commission give before this? It just did that out of the goodness of its heart?",
  "And -- and I think that one of the best indications of what -- what a contract means is the manner in which the parties act under the contract, and that suggests to me that it was never contemplated that North Carolina alone would foot the bill for -- for obtaining this license.",
  "Were there any benefits to the contract at all until -- unless and until there was a waste facility constructed?",
  "What?",
  "It sounds to me pretty hypothetical. And I find it difficult to believe that there is an obligation to commit money and a liability for failure to do so in a compact which says that the State can withdraw at any time. You talk about good faith withdrawal. What would be bad faith withdrawal? North Carolina simply says: It's no longer worth our trouble.",
  "Why?",
  "Do you have any precedent from this Court for reading into a contract between States an obligation of good faith?",
  "Why did they agree to it?",
  "Once again, they are just tender-hearted? I mean, even though North Carolina had an obligation to fund all of it? They just come forward and say: Yes, extort us. I mean, I --",
  "I suggest it's not the power to extort; it's the power to withdraw. And that power to withdraw suggests that there is no absolute obligation to come up with the funding. The two seem to me so -- so inconsistent with -- with one another.",
  "So long as you can withdraw at any time --",
  "Before you get to that --",
  "While we are on 7(C), I'm not clear on how you are reading that last section. Is the last phrase -- \"relating to the enactment of this compact\" -- is it your position that that phrase is joined not only with the immediately preceding words -- \"the laws of the party States\" relating to the enactment of this compact -- but that it also refers back to compliance with the conditions and requirements of this compact relating to the enactment of this compact?",
  "It certainly isn't grammatically compelled, but does it make any sense?",
  "Conditions and requirements relating to the enactment of the compact?",
  "Well, why didn't you withdraw? I mean, all this is very good. You had that absolute right to withdraw, but you didn't withdraw in -- when was it -- '97. You went on for 2 years, still as a member of the compact and still subject to obligations under the compact. How could it be said that you were taking all appropriate steps? What is the language -- all --",
  "Yes.",
  "You took no steps at all. You took zero steps.",
  "Why didn't you withdraw?",
  "They had no benefit from the compact for those 2 years?",
  "Well, you are not arguing impossibility, though. I mean, the other side --",
  "Did North Carolina continue to fund the authority during this interim period?",
  "So it didn't do nothing during this period?",
  "You have the authority still in existence, right?",
  "Don't they have any employees?",
  "So somebody has to be keeping the authority alive, right? Who did that?",
  "So -- wait, wait, wait. You said all the Commission funds were for prior expenditures.",
  "Oh.",
  "Wait. I don't -- I don't understand that.",
  "It never passes through the States, and this provision just waves a magic wand and says that it represents the financial commitments of all party States to the Commission. What proportion from each State? Do we know?",
  "I think all this means is that that is the only financial commitment that the States are obliged to -- to make.",
  "It can't be the money of the States if you can't say how much of it belongs to each State.",
  "That just doesn't make any sense.",
  "The ability to withdraw terminates upon completion of the facility?",
  "Six months afterwards. So the -- the facility's completed. It's clear they are going to have to -- they are going to be charging more than South Carolina, which is a lower cost facility, having been in existence for longer. Why wouldn't everybody get out?",
  "What -- what -- what power conferred upon the Federal Government by the Constitution permits the Federal Government to assure that sexual predators are not at large?",
  "But you said no. I mean, there is no constitutional power on the part of the Federal Government to protect society from sexual predators. And, you know, once the Federal custody is at an end, it seems to me that's the only power you could be relying upon.",
  "But it's fully reestablished once he walks out of Federal prison, at least if he walks out of Federal prison into a State.",
  "Well, but they don't fall through the cracks if the Federal Government notifies the State into which this prisoner is to be released: We are going to release a prisoner; we think he's sexually dangerous; you should take some action to be sure that he doesn't harm society. Because that's a State police function, it's none of our business.",
  "General Kagan, you are relying on the Necessary and Proper Clause, right? You say: But “necessary and proper” doesn't mean it’s necessary and proper for the good of society. It means it’s necessary and proper for the execution of another power that the Federal Government is given by the Constitution. Now, why is this necessary for the execution of any Federal power? The Federal criminal proceeding has terminated. The individual is released. You could say it's necessary for the good of society, but that's not what the Federal Government is charged with. Why is it necessary to any function that the Federal Government is performing? It has completed its performance of the function of incarcerating this individual until he has served his punishment.",
  "General Kagan, I -- I find it difficult to believe that if the Federal Bureau of Prisons wrote the governor of the State into which this person is to be released, and they try to release him in the State where he -- he will in the future reside, and said, we are about to release this person in 60 days or whatever, in our view there are serious mental problems, and we think the State ought to consider commitment proceedings, I find it difficult to believe that an elected governor or an elected attorney general would ignore that letter.",
  "The governor is going to say that at the next election: It would have cost too much to put this guy up.",
  "You know, it costs $65,000.",
  "I must say I'm -- I'm not terribly impressed with -- with the argument --",
  "-- the States won't do it.",
  "I mean, this -- this is a recipe for the Federal Government taking over everything.",
  "The States won't do it; therefore, we have to do it. It has to be done, and therefore the Federal Government steps in and does it.",
  "What about release from the Army? Would that -- would that also -- if I want to turn this -- this person after discharge at -- you know, loose upon the society, could the Federal Government commit that person?",
  "And I'm sure you didn't.",
  "We -- we have a Federal agency that's -- that deals with communicable diseases. It's part of the National Institute of Health, I believe. Is that agency ultra vires? I mean, aren't communicable -- I mean, if anything relates to interstate commerce, it's communicable diseases, it seems to me.",
  "Try the Tenth Amendment.",
  "No, no.",
  "The government can spend money on whatever it wants. That's the spending power. They can set up hospitals. The issue is whether they can force somebody into a hospital, not whether they can set up hospitals. I was going to ask you to tell us why the sky will not fall if we -- if we go the way you would like us to. I assume that if the problem is that the States are unwilling to incur the expenses for these people, that Congress could pass a statute saying the Federal Government will pay the expenses of any prisoners released from Federal prison.",
  "And it seems to me that statute, combined with a letter to the elected governor, who probably wants to be re-elected, or the elected attorney general, will make it pretty certain that the State will take over the responsibility for the individual.",
  "Don't -- don’t States have involuntary commitment procedures?",
  "Now, couldn't the Federal Government fund a Federal -- would you find a constitutional problem in the Federal Government funding an office which brings involuntary commitment proceedings in a State where a prisoner is released when the Federal Government believes --",
  "-- the prisoner is unsafe?",
  "And I presume the State couldn't -- if the -- if the Court says commitment is proper, the State would have to accept the commitment, no?",
  "So why don't they do that?",
  "Yes, but most of the argument for why this is constitutional is simply it's necessary, and therefore it's constitutional. But I'm not even sure it's necessary.",
  "Where do they send them? The last residence where --",
  "How many --",
  "I thought it has to be psychological harm to the child; isn’t that right?",
  "So psychological harm to the woman who can't work in the country would be irrelevant.",
  "-- unless that would secondarily affect the child?",
  "Most courts in countries signatory of the treaty have come out the other way and agree that a ne exeat right is a right of custody, and those courts include the U.K., France, Germany -- I believe, Canada. Very few come out the way you -- how many come out your way?",
  "Well, wait, I mean --",
  "You're writing our opinion for us, are you?",
  "Yes, but, still, in all, I mean, they include some biggies, like the House of Lords, right? And -- and the purpose of a treaty is to have everybody doing the same thing, and -- and I think, we -- if it's a case of some ambiguity, we should try to go along with what seems to be the consensus in -- in other countries that are signatories to the treaty.",
  "Germany.",
  "Is Australia -- is Australia unclear?",
  "Well, according to the Petitioner's brief, if this is inaccurate, the Australian court followed the English Court of Appeal’s decision that Justice Ginsburg referred to, emphasizing the desirability of uniform interpretations of the convention, and I count that against you, the Australia.",
  "We will have to parse them out, obviously.",
  "Well, if these things were effective --",
  "-- we wouldn't -- we wouldn't have a treaty, would we?",
  "If these local remedies were effective, we wouldn't have a treaty.",
  "Wait, does that provision of Texas law override the -- the treaty that the United States has entered into?",
  "Texas can ignore the treaty, because the child is over 12 years old?",
  "I really don't think that the -- the word that we're wrestling with here is the - - the word \"intentional.\" It seems to me it's the word \"violation,\" because violation -- when it says the violation was intentional or unintentional, does \"violation\" mean the act that constitutes a violation of the law, or does \"violation\" mean the -- the fact of violating the law?",
  "Does litigation constitute debt -- debt collection activity?",
  "Okay.",
  "If you ask and they answer.",
  "Mr. Coakley, one of your earlier statements confused me. You relied upon the fact that TILA was amended in 1980 to provide that legal errors are not covered by the TILA defense, and I think you -- I think you describe that as -- as changing the law to -- to provide that -- that legal errors were not covered. But as I understood the situation, every court of appeals to have construed TILA prior to 1980 had held that legal errors were not -- were not included, as -- as your opponent says, they are not included here. So the amendment to TILA was just an affirmation of the judicial interpretation of the language similar to the language here.",
  "Every court of appeals to construe it had held that mistakes of law were not covered. Is that accurate or not?",
  "Well, then -- then your prior statement was very misleading.",
  "There is no basis for saying that the amendment was overturning -- changing the prior meaning of TILA. There is no basis for saying that. All you had were just a few district court opinions, and all the courts of appeals have come out the other way.",
  "I would think all -- which way do these cut? I mean, the fact that there is criminal liability under TILA would seem to me to cut in precisely the opposite direction. You would want to provide excuses of bona fide errors of law, I would think. Why -- am I missing something here?",
  "I would think - -",
  "Mr. Coakley, why do you need a safe harbor if there is no store? I mean what is the purpose of -- of having this procedure, however inefficient it may be, what is the purpose of having it unless you were going to be liable if you make a mistake of law?",
  "You are talking about a safe harbor rule. Leave the harbor.",
  "What does that have to do -- what does that have to do with anything, whether it's prospective or not? The point is what benefit does it give to the person who is asking? If the person is not going to be liable for a bona fide mistake, why would he ever use it?",
  "There are severe limits on the liability, aren't there? Isn't there a thousand - - isn't it a $1,000 limit?",
  "That's not big bucks for an attorney, is it?",
  "But not -- not here.",
  "Not here.",
  "If -- if we find for you and it goes back, then you would -- you would bear that burden.",
  "How does it work?",
  "Mr. Nager, do I have to figure this out here? Is --",
  "Is this issue before us here? Or is it just the issue of whether the lower court was wrong to dismiss your suit on the basis that this is a unitary operation?",
  "I thought that was the only issue.",
  "Well, why am I worrying about this other stuff?",
  "Well, the stated purpose is to promote the game. The purpose is to make money. I don't think that they care whether the sale of the helmet or the T-shirt promotes the game. They -- they sell it to make money from the sale.",
  "Now, it promotes the game if the money from the sale goes to the whole group, I suppose. But -- but don't tell me that there is not -- absent this agreement, there would not be an independent, individual incentive for each of the teams to sell as many of its own -- of its own shirts and helmets as possible.",
  "Well, I suppose that -- that could -- that issue could be tried.",
  "But I don't -- I don't think so. And I suppose that's a triable issue, as to whether the purpose of -- of selling these things is to promote the whole NFL or to promote the particular team.",
  "Well, you -- you say that the -- that the trademarks have no value apart from the -- from the game. I guess you could say the same thing for each individual franchise of each of the 32 clubs. They are worthless, if NFL football disappears. So does that mean they -- they can agree to fix the price at which their -- their franchises will be sold, by concerted agreement, because after all, they’re worthless apart from the NFL?",
  "Yes.",
  "Oh, okay, you --",
  "I thought I was reducing it to the absurd. But you --",
  "Allis-Chalmers involved the two parties to the contract, a tort claim by one party to the contract against the other party to the contract, right?",
  "And this involves a tort claim by one party to the contract against a third party. It seems to me it's quite -- quite different from Allis-Chalmers.",
  "So you -- while saying that there’s no cause of action for this tort claim, you nonetheless say that the tort claim can be considered an unfair labor practice by the labor board. Why does that make any sense?",
  "Has -- has the board, in fact, declared a party who is not a party to the labor contract guilty of an unfair labor practice in prior cases?",
  "Why -- why isn't it under 8(b)(3)? How does 8(b)(3) read? What is it in 8(b)(3) that would exclude this from the labor board's --",
  "Mr. Lamken, am I wrong that you don't really object to the recognition of “constructive termination,” if that phrase is used the way it is used elsewhere in contract law?",
  "Gee, I thought -- I thought that if you had a lease and the landlord fails to provide heat, that you can move out and he will be deemed to have constructively evicted you.",
  "Yes, but what happens after that? Don't you take the position that the station owner then has to refuse all other elements of the contract, right?",
  "Now, wait, wait --",
  "I thought you said there is a termination by the company if it fails to provide one of the three basic elements, right?",
  "That is a termination?",
  "What response has to be made by the station owner? Anything?",
  "He can continue to take the other two elements?",
  "Yes or no?",
  "And there has still been a termination?",
  "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This is all one contract, isn't it? You are saying --",
  "You're saying you can terminate a third of the contract?",
  "And they are not contingent on each other, so that at any time the company could terminate one of them and stick the station owner with the other two?",
  "Not continues to be. You must continue to be.",
  "That sounds like a very strange way to write the contract.",
  "I'm not talking about writing the statute. I'm talking about writing the contract.",
  "Do you really think that that's how those contracts should be interpreted?",
  "What does the company have to do in your view to effect a genuine termination and not a constructive termination?",
  "Why isn't that constructive termination?",
  "I mean, the conduct is you stopped sending me the gas you are supposed to send me.",
  "Well, I don't understand what your number two consists of unless it consists of an act that the other side would call constructive -- or the government would call constructive termination.",
  "Yes.",
  "I think there’s always an unclear line between those two.",
  "Well, the franchisor stops delivering gas. There are three -- three different obligations under the contract. What does the franchisee have to do to show that he has accepted it as a termination? Why does he have to leave the premises? That's another contract, is -- is what the --",
  "Up -- up to that point, which supposedly a jury can find, the tipping point where a reasonable franchisee would abandon -- up until then, he has a contract claim, right? And then at that magical point, the contract claim is converted into a claim under the statute?",
  "Why isn't the contract claim alone enough?",
  "\"In the context of termination\" is what the statute says.",
  "What background principles were they? I don't know about constructive termination. There was constructive discharge and constructive eviction. But --",
  "What do you do about the claim of -- of the -- the Petitioners that only one of the three contracts has been terminated?",
  "The other two continue -- continue in effect?",
  "Of course, your -- your approach puts -- puts the company -- the oil company in a very strange position. It doesn't know whether it has a contract or not. It -- the contract is terminated if your client says it's terminated. If he doesn't say it's terminated, it's not terminated. I mean, a very weird contract where you -- you’re subject to the whim of the other party as to whether the contract continues or not.",
  "Well, I don't know. They -- you know, if they knew that they were pulling out and -- and were claiming a termination, they might have been looking for somebody else to take over the franchise.",
  "But we don't have any urns here.",
  "What's wrong --",
  "Yes. What's wrong with a rule?",
  "With a rule? With picking a number, rather than leaving it up to the courts of appeals or the district courts to use different numbers, different times? I don't have to review all of these cases all the time. Why don't we pick a number? You want 10, right?",
  "Yes --",
  "That's why Las Vegas makes a profit, right?",
  "Do you have to be a -- a resident of the district in order to serve as a juror in the district court?",
  "You have to be?",
  "So then if this system were not in effect, and if Grand Rapids had to take white jurors from other counties as opposed to a larger percentage of black jurors from Grand Rapids, then you’d have a claim in Grand Rapids, wouldn't you?",
  "Well, you -- you’d have a jury pool in Grand Rapids that wouldn't reflect the larger number of blacks in Grand Rapids.",
  "So you’re damned if you do and damned if you don't, right?",
  "Excuse me. You -- if that statement is true, then -- then there is -- there’s no third part to the three-part test. I thought Duren established a three-part test.",
  "And the third one was that you had to establish -- after having already established the disparity, you had to establish that there was a selection process which caused the disparity. And you are telling us that you don't have to proceed to step 3. Once you show the disparity, it is assumed that it is the product of the system.",
  "How do you reconcile that with the third test? Please tell me how you reconcile that statement with the fact that it did set forth a three -- a three-prong test.",
  "Mr. Sterling, I don't -- you seem to acknowledge that, to make your case, you have to show that Grand Rapids district drew from the pool a disproportionate number of people. Why -- why do you have to prove that? If Grand Rapids contributes to the pool an inordinate, disproportionate number of the minority -- blacks in this case -- even if Grand Rapids simply took back a proportionate number from the pool, it would still have a disproportionate effect on reducing the number of blacks in the overall pool, wouldn't it?",
  "But a step -- a step in the right direction is not enough. You were adducing that to prove that the prior system had a significant effect, and it turned out, it didn't have a very significant effect. It doesn't prove your point to say, well, it's a step in the right direction. If it's insignificant, it's insignificant. Whether it's insignificant in the right direction or the wrong direction doesn't matter.",
  "I still don't -- I don't understand this problem of -- of you have to show that they took back more than they contributed. Let's assume that Grand Rapids is -- is entirely black, and its entire delegation that goes to the pool are all black, okay? And let's assume that those blacks are 10 percent of the -- the totality, and there are no blacks from anywhere else, okay? Then Grand Rapids takes back simply the number of people it -- it took, its set, which would be 10 percent, and it takes black -- takes back all of the blacks, who are the Grand Rapids residents. All of the other districts would thereby have zero percent blacks instead of 10 percent, which is what they ought to have.",
  "Exactly.",
  "Exactly. So why expect the other districts to have 10 percent blacks simply because Grand Rapids contributed 10 percent of the totality, all of whom were black? There -- then there’s a requirement for each district to have 10 percent blacks, right? But if Grand Rapids takes back its -- its -- the people it sent, there are no more blacks left to go around.",
  "Right. But -- but when the administrator has interpreted the plan incorrectly and the court finds -- the court of appeals finds that he has interpreted it incorrectly, it doesn't have to send it back and say, you know: Give me another bid; try something else. It says: You did it incorrectly, and we find that what you should have done is this. Isn't that what normally happens?",
  "So all a court can do in those trust cases is to say: You've got it wrong, Sam; go back and do it again. Right?",
  "And he gets it wrong again, and he goes back to court; the court says: Sam, it's still wrong; go back and do it again.",
  "I can't believe that that's what the law is.",
  "Well, why -- this is important to me, whether the plan administrator was interpreting the same language when this case was remanded back down. Originally, he was simply applying the methodology that had been specified in 1990, right?",
  "And the court said that was no good because you didn't give these people notice of it. But that -- he had been applying that test not since 1990, but since 1980. In other words, he had taken that to be a reasonable interpretation of the very summary language in -- in the plan itself, right?",
  "So when it went back, why didn't he stick with that and say: Yes, they didn't have adequate notice of that, but that is still a reasonable interpretation of the original plan, even before we specified that.",
  "Yes.",
  "I understand that. Why did he do that? Inasmuch as the first interpretation was not adopted in 1990, but it was adopted under the same language that he is now interpreting in 1980, right? He was applying it between 1980 and 1990. That's what he thought he -- that's what he thought the plan meant in all those years.",
  "After 1990.",
  "Oh, I didn't understand. I didn't understand it.",
  "Well, your -- your brief says: \"The Plan Administrator has consistently applied the reconstructed account methodology since the early '80s.\"",
  "\"Effective April '90\" -- \"1990, the Plan language requiring this methodology provided as follows.\" So I took that to mean there was no such language before that?",
  "There was plan language requiring it before 1990.",
  "Okay.",
  "Okay. That's -- that's what I thought, and I thought you said no when I asked that question, that this detailed description of the RAM didn't come in until 1990.",
  "Oh -- oh, I see.",
  "I got you.",
  "So you claim -- you claim that what he is interpreting when it comes back to him is not the same text that they invalidated --",
  "-- but rather it's the plan without this text.",
  "The court of appeals said it’s just an application of equitable principles --",
  "-- not an interpretation of the plan.",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "One -- well, I thought you said what this affects is just the floor; it doesn't affect the level of the -- of the defined contribution.",
  "It's not the same question. When the court has held that 1 and 2 was, in effect, not in the contract because you didn't give enough notice of it. So now you have a contract without 1 and 2 in it.",
  "So it's a different question. What does this contract mean without 1 and 2? Now, you may have a different point, if -- if you say that what -- and it seems to me you did say this, that the court of appeal -- the court of appeals, not only decided that there was no notice and, therefore, this provision wasn't any good, but you claim that the court of appeals also said that you cannot account for the time value of money.",
  "That -- now, that would be a totally different case.",
  "But I didn't read it that way.",
  "That's a little different.",
  "Excuse me. Are you talking about the court of appeals sending it back to the district court, or are you talking about the district court sending it back to the administrator?",
  "We can handle those facts --",
  "We can handle those facts just as easily as the district court.",
  "We -- we don't have to look at the witness's demeanor.",
  "I mean, just because a decision has some factual basis -- every decision has some factual basis. That doesn't mean that -- that an appellate court, including this one, can't decide the questions.",
  "Why do you keep stressing that -- you know, the district court was there and saw these facts? That's fine --",
  "What if I don't think it's the same terms?",
  "So, in principle, if -- if we accept your argument, if other retirees who are later rehired bring a lawsuit in another court, you might have a different result because it would be up to the -- up to that court to decide what was -- what was a proper result, right?",
  "That's the consequence of not deferring to the plan administrator. You have --",
  "Can we go back to the urns?",
  "Well, we interpret gaps in -- in documents all the time. That's part of interpreting a document, figuring out what it provides for in a lot of situations that it does not explicitly cover. I don't know why that isn't interpreting the plan.",
  "But the court of appeals held that this one was inadequate because it did not say that you were going to take into account the time value of money. If that's the reason it held that this one was bad, the same reason would apply to the plain vanilla.",
  "What authority does a court have to direct that the money be paid to the attorney?",
  "Doesn't -- doesn't the government setoff depend upon who owns the money under State law? I mean, it's -- it's commonplace for the Federal law to look to State law on issues of ownership. And, in fact, if there is this doctrine of equitable ownership on the part of the attorney, what right does the government have to do the setoff?",
  "Okay, let's take the regulation: \"A person who is entitled to the benefit of all or part of the payment.\" Ultimately, isn't it the plaintiff who has recovered that is entitled to the benefit, because this money is given to him in order that he can meet a financial obligation that he owes to the lawyer? I mean, if this didn't exist, he'd owe the lawyer and have to pony it up out of his own pocket, no?",
  "And in those cases, you agree the offset can be made?",
  "Well, you say that in Social Security the attorney is forbidden to accept pay-as-you-go? Is --",
  "But that doesn't mean that there is not either an express or an implied contract between the attorney and the Social Security recipient.",
  "Well, but if there is that implied contract, then it is an obligation of the recipient.",
  "Well, I don't see how that leads you where you want to go. Then the payment given to the recipient does indeed benefit the recipient by -- by paying off an obligation that the Social Security recipient has.",
  "I thought the -- I thought the government said they only did that when -- when the court directed that it be paid to the attorney.",
  "There’s an independent violation without an impact? I mean, it's not the impact provision that you quoted which makes that a violation. It must be some other provision that makes it a violation. What other provision is it?",
  "Right.",
  "Sure.",
  "Well, that’s because of an impending violation.",
  "But you say -- you say it is an actual violation.",
  "And that would be clear even though it had not been established much earlier that the test was invalid. So a city could go along using a test that was an invalid test, not declared such; 10 years later, somebody comes up and says: This test that is being applied to me is an invalid test.",
  "What -- of what use is a statute of limitations that -- that -- that operates that way?",
  "How do you -- the problem I have with all of this -- it makes entire sense, except when you read subpart (k), it says “an unlawful employment practice based on disparate impact is established” if “a complaining party demonstrates that a respondent uses a particular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race.”",
  "Which is what happened here.",
  "They used --",
  "Where -- where does it go on? To say what?",
  "Well, it hasn't criminalized speech. It has criminalized providing aid and assistance to these organizations. Most of that aid and assistance that is prohibited is not in the form of speech, but it happens to include speech as well.",
  "I think that’s quite different from a law that is directed explicitly at speech.",
  "That's not the right -- that's not the right number three. The right number three is you cannot advise and assist an organization that is seeking to overthrow the government. That's what is at issue here, not --",
  "-- not independently promoting the objectives of these terrorist organizations. Your -- your clients are free to do that.",
  "But when they assist the organization by providing advice, that's a different matter.",
  "Okay. When they provide a benefit, right?",
  "Well, we -- we can cross that bridge when we come to it.",
  "This is an as-applied challenge, and we are talking about the kind of advice and assistance that your clients want to give.",
  "It's not a New York Times editorial.",
  "It depends on what \"coordinating\" means, doesn't it? And we can determine that in the next case.",
  "The end that Congress seeks to proscribe is the existence of these terrorist organizations. And the theory of the legislation is that when you aid any of their enterprises you’re aiding the organization. Hamas, for example, gained support among -- among the Palestinians by activities that are perfectly lawful, perhaps running hospitals, all sorts of things.",
  "But that is what fosters the terrorist organization and enables the terrorist activities. Why isn't that a reasonable connection? Any assistance you provide to these organizations cannot be separated from assistance to their terrorist activities.",
  "I think it's very unrealistic to compare these terrorist organizations with the Communist Party. Those cases involved philosophy. The Communist Party was -- was -- was more than a -- than an organization that -- that had some unlawful ends. It was also a philosophy of -- of -- of extreme socialism. And -- and many people subscribed to that philosophy. I don't think that Hamas or any of these terrorist organizations represent such a philosophical organization.",
  "That may be, but people joined it for philosophical reasons.",
  "They joined it for philosophical reasons. These terrorist organizations have very practical objectives. And the only reason for joining them or assisting them is to assist those practical objectives.",
  "Well, in a way there is. What about -- what about aiding organizations that are acting criminally, killing innocent civilians, with regard to one of our allies? And we’re seeking to gain the assistance of these allies against those terrorists who aim their terrorism at us, and yet --",
  "-- we -- we are supposed to allow our citizens to assist the terrorist organizations that are directing their violence against them?",
  "Why isn't that a sufficiently serious reason for the government to do what it's done here?",
  "Why do you say Congress clearly did not intend that? You know, I would have guessed that you are providing a service or personnel when you make yourself a member of the organization. Why do you say Congress clearly did not intend it?",
  "Well, Mohammed Atta and his harmonica quartet might tour the country and make a lot of money. Right?",
  "Why do these hypotheticals make any difference? This is an as-applied challenge. We should look to the activities that this organization wants to conduct, unless -- unless you think that there is an overbreadth problem. And that seems to me -- I'm not even sure that the Petitioners assert that here. Clearly, the -- the broad scope of this statute is -- is constitutional, and whatever aspects of speech it may run afoul of are -- are minimal. That being the case, of what relevance are these hypotheticals? It's a lot of fun, and it's very interesting, but we can deal with all of that when the situations arise, can't we?",
  "Unless you're in an overbreadth situation, a vagueness challenge can be an as-applied challenge. A statute can be vague as applied to certain conduct, although the core conduct that it covers is clearly covered.",
  "We have cases like that.",
  "Well wait. There’s -- there’s some sentencing stuff in -- in the first part as well. There’s sentencing stuff in (A). You can't say that (A) deals only with elements and (B) deals with sentencing.",
  "I mean, (A) says, \"shall be sentenced to 5 years.\" Or to 7 years, or to 10 years. So there’s sentencing stuff in (A).",
  "So does -- so does the language of (A)(ii) and (A)(iii), which is the same language: “if the firearm is brandished”; “if the firearm is discharged” -- they all apply to a conviction for carrying the firearm. There has to be a conviction before those things apply.",
  "So that makes (A) the same as (B). And -- and you don't claim that the elements in (A) are just sentencing elements, do you?",
  "But still and all, if -- if Congress were being precise and if the statute is to be read the way you suggest, the introduction to capital (B) should have been \"if the firearm possessed by a person convicted of a violation of paragraph (A) above,\" and then pick it up, \"is,\" so forth. Right? I mean, that would -- would be more precise.",
  "Yes.",
  "I guess I agree with you that if (B) is -- if (B) is an element, (C) would be an element, too.",
  "Right.",
  "Isn't the old one in your brief, too, in your --",
  "It's 3a of the government's brief.",
  "All right. Okay.",
  "All right.",
  "Well, except that with -- with (C), you -- you could say that traditionally recidivism has been a sentencing factor, and you cannot say with respect to (B) that whether it's a short-barreled rifle or a machinegun has traditionally been a sentencing factor. To the contrary, it was an element.",
  "Let's -- let's talk about the guidelines. Without the application of (B), the guidelines would provide for a much shorter sentence, wouldn't they?",
  "The guidelines -- do you think that if under the guidelines the sentence was 30 years because of a machinegun, do you think that that would be upheld?",
  "Do you think it would be upheld as a reasonable sentence under our Booker/Fanfan theory of -- of how the guidelines are to be applied?",
  "Where -- where is the life sentence maximum, by the way? I -- you say this is a minimum. It's just a mandatory minimum because the maximum is specified to be life. Where is that specified?",
  "Where -- where do you get the life maximum? I -- I'm reading through, and there's -- it mentions nothing about life.",
  "And if it mentions nothing about life, then these are not mandatory minimums. To the contrary, they are -- they are new maximums.",
  "I don't find that implied at all. I don't see why it's implied.",
  "That's right. That’s --",
  "That's her question.",
  "I think what you are exposed to, as I read the statute, (c)(1)(A) does not impose a new sentence at all. It just says there will be added to whatever the sentence is for the crime of violence or the drug trafficking crime -- there will be added to that sentence. Then it says you’ll add 7 years; you’ll add 25 years; you’ll add 30 years. Those are not mandatory minimums. Those are add-ons to the sentence provided by the substantive crime to which (c)(1)(A) refers. That way, the whole thing makes sense.",
  "I’ll amend what I said. It is a mandatory minimum if the substantive crime referred to in (c)(1)(A) is above what is specified in -- in this statute. But if it -- if it is below that, if the drug trafficking crime only provided for 15 years, and you did the crime with a machinegun, you get 30 years, that's an add-on.",
  "I got it.",
  "It's also on 3a of the government's brief.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "It says “in addition to” at the end of (c)(1)(A): “Who, in furtherance … possesses a firearm shall, in addition to the punishment provided for by such crime of violence, be sentenced to” 5 years, 7 years, 10 years. And then if the firearm, blah, blah, blah, is blah, blah, blah -- since your -- I assume that that introductory language \"in addition to the punishment provided for\" is implicit in (B). It's expressed in (A), but I think it's implicit in (B).",
  "Yes.",
  "In addition to the term that’s -- that exists for the substantive offense.",
  "That's the right answer.",
  "We have tall lawyers today. What is this, tall lawyer day?",
  "Oh, I guess I'm not following the ball here. I thought the government had conceded that sub (i), sub (ii), sub (iii) under (A) are not sentencing factors but are elements. Is that not --",
  "Well, that's even worse, then. I agree with you.",
  "And you believe there is a background of life sentence? You agree with the government that --",
  "Well, it either is or isn't. You --",
  "There must be some statutory provision that you -- that you -- that you rely upon.",
  "Where does 7 years come from?",
  "The prior statute -- which was 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1), right? That did deal with short-barreled rifle, short-barreled shotgun, machinegun, and so forth, but that's -- that provision didn't say anything about brandishing or discharge. Where -- what was -- how were they treated under the prior law?",
  "Well, it's not as though he was authorized to make something a crime which wasn't -- which wasn’t a crime.",
  "He was authorized to say you have to register.",
  "You -- you’re saying it has to take place not just after the offense, but after the obligation to register.",
  "Which is what the statute says.",
  "Well, assuming it does depend on the purpose of the statute, what would the purpose -- it wouldn't cover his transportation as an infant. What does he have to be, 20 years old?",
  "Or 15 years old?",
  "Or is it 20 years before the offense or 25 years before the offense? I guess we could make it up, couldn't we?",
  "But which the States didn't enact.",
  "And would that be the case after SORNA, that some States would have less extensive coverage than others?",
  "Well, unless that could be the case, then I don't see what is achieved by -- why you worry about somebody moving to another State in order to evade the registration.",
  "I mean, if the new State requires you to register just as much as the old one, what are you worried about?",
  "Fail to register entirely?",
  "Perhaps Congress --",
  "It's conceivable also that Congress was -- was not confident that the States would be as active in prosecuting violations as the Federal Government would be.",
  "Where -- where -- where? (2)(A)? Which is where?",
  "I see. “Or” --",
  "And they don't have to travel in interstate commerce.",
  "Right.",
  "How long ago --",
  "I don't know where you get that from. I can understand how you can say, which is what Mr. Rothfeld says, that it has to follow the requirement to register. That's the way the statute reads: Whoever, one, is required to register, not whoever has committed an offense that -- that would later justify registration. It seems to me you are just making up the -- the prior act that -- that triggers the interstate travel requirement.",
  "Well, what text do you base it on? (1) says \"is required to register,\" and the position of the Petitioner is: After you are required to register, you must travel in interstate commerce. And you say: No, it's after you commit the offense that you must travel in interstate. Where do you get that from?",
  "No, but -- but it doesn't, because if you haven't been -- if you are convicted of a Federal offense, you are automatically in, but if you are convicted of a State offense, you’re in only if you travel in interstate commerce after that offense. So you don't resolve the inconsistency between (A) and (B). There is still going to be some inconsistency between the two.",
  "Exactly.",
  "That -- that’s a much less powerful point. There is inconsistency between (A) and (B), no matter what you do.",
  "Yes, where -- where it means prior travel, it says so, use of a firearm that has traveled in interstate commerce. They use the past tense when they mean it.",
  "Mr. Rothfeld, I hate to eat up any of your rebuttal time, but this is sort of by way of unfinished business. Justice Alito asked three questions at the beginning of this interesting exercise. I think you only answered the first. I don't even remember the third anymore.",
  "But I was interested in the second, which mentioned other provisions in this -- in this very statute that -- that use the present tense.",
  "You have to change the language \"is required to register\" to \"has committed a\" --",
  "You don't want us to do it, right? You want us to remand it so that they can do it, right? Is that --",
  "Well -- well, but the same constitutional analysis includes step four, which is whether it undermines confidence in the result. And don't you think that some constitutional violations more undermine confidence than others?",
  "I suppose if the instruction told the jury in a criminal case that you can find the defendant guilty if you think it more likely than not that he committed the crime, that might be different, don't you think?",
  "Address the test used by the Second Circuit. That's what we’re concerned about.",
  "And that's what the question pertained to. They’re using a test nobody else used, that does not comport with -- with our prior opinions. Why shouldn't we send it back and tell them, you know, use the right test?",
  "Well, you call it an ex post facto violation, but I -- I -- I rather agree with the government; it's a due process violation.",
  "-- what happened is improper evidence was admitted, because it concerned pre- -- pre-statute conduct. But it might have been evidence that was -- that was irrelevant for some other reason. That would be just as much of a -- a due process violation. What is special about the fact that the reason the evidence before the jury was incorrect was that it -- the conduct occurred before the -- before the statute?",
  "And when a State court allows pre-law conduct to uphold a conviction, that is an ex post facto violation, and we would reverse the State court judgment. But that's not what occurred here. What occurred here is that the trial court let the jury consider evidence, as evidence bearing upon conviction, which it should not have let the jury consider. And there’s a lot of evidence that a court should not have let the jury consider. I don't see anything particularly special about fact that the reason this evidence shouldn’t have been before the jury was that it occurred before the statute.",
  "And -- and, therefore, no violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.",
  "There’s also no violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause, which is in Article I of the Constitution and which says no ex post facto Law shall be passed.",
  "You don't have -- you don’t have an ex post facto law that was passed here. You have an incorrect jury charge. You have the judge telling the jury that you could convict on the basis of this prior conduct when, in fact, you couldn't. That is not an ex post facto law.",
  "I’m looking for Marks, where is that in -- is that in your brief somewhere?",
  "You have mentioned several times the Marks case. What case is --",
  "Where is that?",
  "Is it in your brief?",
  "I mean, see, I don't know what that case is. If it was a case in which we reversed a State supreme court because the State supreme court upheld the State statute that -- you know, that made prior conduct unlawful, then I -- I think I could say that was an ex post facto violation through the Fourteenth Amendment.",
  "Okay. This -- this evidence was improper because if the legislature had made that action punishable when it occurred before the statute was enacted, that would have been a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. Now, in fact, the legislature didn't do that, and, therefore, we have no real violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. But we do have the admission of evidence that shouldn't have been admitted, which is no different from evidence that should have not been admitted for some other reason. For example, where the -- where the court gives an instruction that permits evidence to be considered as evidence of the crime which, in fact, is irrelevant to the crime. And the jury says you can find him guilty if you find that he held two fingers up in the air, when, in fact, that has nothing to do with the crime. Why is this any different from that? It's just evidence that the jury should not have been allowed to use for conviction. I don't see why there is anything special about the fact that the reason it shouldn't be used for conviction --",
  "-- is because it occurred pre-statute.",
  "Courtesy -- courtesy of Justice Kennedy, I have -- I have before me the Marks case. And the -- the summary of the case at the beginning says: “Petitioners were convicted of transporting obscene materials in violation of the Federal statute.” “Held: The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment precludes retroactive application to petitioners of the Miller standards.” It was a due process case.",
  "And, therefore, the Due Process Clause was violated when the court let that in.",
  "So you -- you have to persuade us that there is something special about a violation of the Due Process Clause that lets in evidence which is pre-statute, as opposed to violations that let in other evidence that should not properly be used to convict the defendant. And I frankly don't -- don't see why it's so special.",
  "What 49 and 50? Of the government's brief?",
  "I mean, just because you can pick something that everybody would agree comes within a denial of honest services, doesn't -- doesn't mean that when you say nothing but honest services, you’re saying something that -- that has sufficient content to -- to support a criminal prosecution.",
  "And there were cases that -- that -- some of which included bribery, but others of which included a variety of -- of other actions, some of which were allowed by some courts and some of which were disallowed by some courts. There was no solid content to what McNally covered.",
  "But it's circular, isn't it?",
  "I'm sorry. The duty of an employee to provide honest services to his employer -- that's not included because the employee is not a fiduciary?",
  "Where do you get the fiduciary limitation?",
  "All it says is \"honest services.\" I would think that --",
  "-- any employee has the obligation to provide honest services.",
  "That doesn't give me a whole lot of comfort, I mean, just because there’s an intent to deceive. An intent to deceive can be the basis for -- for terminating a contract. There's -- there's been fraud in the inducement or something of that sort. So I know I’m liable to have the contract terminated, and maybe for damages for the contract. And you say: And also, by the way, you know, you can go to jail for a number of years, because, oh, yes, it's very vague, but you intended to deceive, and that's all -- that's all you need to know.",
  "So either this was too little or Martha Stewart was too much?",
  "Wait. Do -- do we have any case that says that 2 and a quarter hours is too long?",
  "And that there can't be a waiver after 2 and a quarter hours?",
  "And, therefore, there’s no clearly established Supreme Court law that 2 and a quarter hours is too long.",
  "Isn't that the name of the game here?",
  "I don't understand how this person could just sit there for 2 hours and didn't want to be interrogated and doesn't say: You know, I don't want to answer your questions. He just sits there, and some questions he doesn't answer. And he does make a few comments, anyway.",
  "Why shouldn't we have a rule which simply says if you don't want to be interrogated, all you have to say is \"I don't want to answer your questions\"?",
  "That's nice and clear, wouldn't be any problem at all. That was never said here. He, in fact, submitted to having these questions asked of him.",
  "Why should the police have to play this game of, you know, an hour and a half, 2 hours, 2 hours and 15 minutes, 5 hours, 7 hours? Why don't we have just a clear rule: You’re read your rights; if you don't want to be questioned all you have to say is: I don't want to be questioned.",
  "Is there any difference between -- between waiving your right and a failure to assert your right?",
  "Is every failure to assert a waiver?",
  "What about before that? What is happening before that?",
  "He hasn't asserted his right. I mean, he hasn't said I --",
  "He has done neither.",
  "He has neither waived nor asserted.",
  "Well, you’re saying there -- there’s a difference, I -- I assume, between not waiving and positively asserting your right not to be interrogated?",
  "So, if -- if he had -- here he simply refused to sign the -- the Miranda form, right?",
  "Which would have -- which would been the -- the waiver. And -- and you’re saying it's his later behavior that -- that showed that, in fact, he waived. What if instead of just refusing to sign, he had said, I do not want to be interrogated?",
  "Okay.",
  "So -- so he has the right to terminate the whole thing by asserting his right. If he neither asserts the right nor grants the waiver, the police can continue to try to obtain a statement from him?",
  "Unless, I assume, that you -- you -- you acknowledge that if the interrogation had go on -- had gone on for so long that it had become coercive, then that -- that -- that last statement would not -- would not be a voluntary waiver.",
  "It depends on what you -- what you need to make \"it,\" it depends on what \"it\" is. If -- if you mean the ultimate confession, I think I don't agree. Ultimately, if he confesses and hasn't been coerced, it's voluntary. But if by the \"it\" you mean to make the continuation of the interrogation voluntary, that's a different question. And I don't know that our cases establish that you cannot continue the interrogation until there has been a waiver.",
  "But does that make it clear that -- that there has to be a waiver before the interrogation can continue? And if it does, how does it square with Butler?",
  "They’re both under -- they’re both under Miranda. Both of those rights are Miranda rights.",
  "It was read to him.",
  "And they had him read a portion of the Miranda warning.",
  "Huh?",
  "What?",
  "Yes, they had him read --",
  "So I -- boy, I -- what more do you need?",
  "I mean, he -- he’s listening when -- when they read it to him. He -- he -- he can read it himself.",
  "Maybe -- maybe he doesn't want to talk for the moment, but he does want to listen. I'm not sure you’re doing defendants a great -- a great favor. I mean, some of them might want to listen to -- to the police telling them, you know, by the way, your co-conspirator is singing like a bird and he's trying to pin it all on you, and maybe, you know, if -- if you don't want to get left holding the bag, maybe you’d better to talk to us and tell us what really happened. I'm not sure that -- that if I were there, even if I didn't want to talk right now, I might still want to listen, which is apparently what this -- what this person did. He could have said, I don't want to -- I don't want talk. And it -- and it would have ended. That would have been an assertion of his right. He didn't assert his right, but --",
  "-- he -- he sat there and listened. Now, maybe he wanted to find out what the police would have to say to him.",
  "Of course, those facts are relevant only if we accept your -- your principal assertion, which is that you -- you don't have to invoke the right and interrogation must cease immediately. If we agree with that, then all of these facts become relevant. But if we think that, until you invoke the right, the police can continue to ask you questions and it's up to you to answer or not, then those facts are really not relevant at all, are they? I think that's true.",
  "It wasn't meant to be a trick question.",
  "On your theory, those -- those factual things are irrelevant, whether --",
  "Exactly, exactly.",
  "I must say I've never understood that to be the law, and I don't think it's generally understood to be the law, that unless you get a waiver right at the outset, you have to -- you have to terminate interrogation. I think there are a lot of police departments that don't -- I've never understood that to be the rule.",
  "I'm not saying it isn't a good rule. It may be a good rule. But the issue here is whether it is so clearly established that it was unreasonable for the State court to think otherwise.",
  "I like clear rules. Your rule is a clear one. Another clear one would be just the opposite of yours; that is, that interrogation can continue unless he asserts his right. That's another clear rule. We can go either way, and it will be clear.",
  "But he doesn't answer. He just sits there --",
  "-- impassively.",
  "Then they have to stop?",
  "Wait. Excuse me. A waiver of what? I thought the Chief Justice was talking about a waiver of your right to remain silent.",
  "That wasn't a waiver --",
  "-- of his right to remain silent.",
  "I'm willing to talk to you, I'm willing to listen to you. It seems to me you’re confusing a -- a waiver of -- of the right to remain silent with a waiver of the right not to be interrogated, which is the right that you are asserting here, a right not to be interrogated, unless going in you say, I waive my right to remain silent. That's -- that's the new right that you are asserting.",
  "A right not to be interrogated.",
  "Well, that -- but that's the case in every case where -- where the lawyer is negligent and doesn't do something that -- that should have been done.",
  "He has assured the client, I will take care of your case, and he doesn't do it.",
  "That's all that happened here.",
  "We've never held that equitable tolling for anything is available under this statute of limitations here.",
  "And why should it be? It seems to me, this is not like the ordinary statute of limitations, where it says, you know, the statute is five years, and courts make all sorts of necessary exceptions to the five years. But here you have a statute that -- that provides exceptions, for example, “the limitation period shall run from the latest of the date on which the impediment to filing an application created by State action in violation … is removed.” In other words, we’re going to toll it for that particular event. “The date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court” -- we’re going to toll it for that. “The date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through exercise of due diligence.” Many of -- many of the equitable tolling holdings involved precisely that. We’ll toll it since you couldn't have found out about the violation within the statutory period. But all of these things are handled already in 2244(d). Why should we -- why should we assume the right to create some additional exceptions from the -- from the 1-year period?",
  "We have a case this afternoon involving an opinion of ours named McNally, which held that there's no such thing as a fraud action for a right to honest services. How many of the courts of appeals had held that there did exist such a right when we held that there didn't in McNally?",
  "Every single court of appeals that had faced it had held that there was such a right. So the mere fact that you have 11 court of appeals that have found that they have extraordinary power -- judges like to find that they have power -- and that doesn't necessarily make it right.",
  "All of that has nothing to do with -- with what caused -- what caused the inability to -- to bring the habeas action.",
  "All of that is -- is preliminary to that. This may have been a very irresponsible lawyer, but that has nothing to do with the event that -- the simple event, failure to file in that what, 30-day period, which --",
  "Fourteen days. It seems to me \"extraordinary\" means unusual. So you say any unusual event is a possible?",
  "Any unusual event is a possible for a court to say, oh, yes, it says a year, but this is unusual so we will give you a year and a half.",
  "And had a lot of time to devote to it.",
  "Mr. Gura, do you think it’s at all easier to bring the Second Amendment under the Privileges and Immunities Clause than it is to bring it under our established law of substantive due process?",
  "Is it easier to do it under privileges and immunities than it is under substantive due process?",
  "No, no. I'm not talking about whether -- whether the Slaughter-House Cases were right or wrong. I'm saying, assuming we give, you know, the Privileges and Immunities Clause your definition, does that make it any easier to get the Second Amendment adopted with respect to the States?",
  "And if the answer is no, why are you asking us to overrule 150, 140 years of prior law, when -- when you can reach your result under substantive due -- I mean, you know, unless you’re bucking for a -- a place on some law school faculty --",
  "Well, I mean, what you argue is the darling of the professoriate, for sure, but it's also contrary to 140 years of our jurisprudence. Why do you want to undertake that burden instead of just arguing substantive due process? Which, as much as I think it's wrong, I have -- even I have acquiesced in it.",
  "Well, what about rights rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people? Would -- would that do the job?",
  "That happens to be the test we have used under substantive due process.",
  "Yes.",
  "There’s a lot of statistical disagreement on whether the Miranda rule saves lives or not, whether it results in the release of dangerous people who have confessed to their crime, but the confession can't be used. We don't -- we don't resolve questions like that on the basis of statistics, do we?",
  "Well, why would this one be resolved on the basis of statistics? If there’s a constitutional right, we find what the minimum constitutional right is, and everything above that is up to the States.",
  "If they want to have, you know -- I think we mentioned in Heller concealed carry laws. I mean, those are -- those are matters that we didn't decide in Heller. And you may have a great deal of divergence from State to State. And on that, I suppose, you would do statistics, wouldn't you? Or the legislature would.",
  "For the judges. For the judges.",
  "But they would be for the legislatures.",
  "I guess we -- I guess we have applied substantive due process with regard to the necessity of permitting homosexual conduct and with respect to the necessity of permitting abortion on demand. We have not adopted a more rigid rule for the Federal Government than we have adopted for the States in either of those instances, have we?",
  "When is the last time an opinion of ours made that the test, implicit in the concept of ordered liberty? It sounds very nice. But when is the last time we used it? I think it was 1937.",
  "Has it been the basis of our decision in any case since Palko?",
  "Is the right to trial by jury implicit in the concept of ordered liberty?",
  "My goodness --",
  "-- there are a lot of countries that don't give the right to trial by jury, even England does not give it in all criminal cases.",
  "That may be --",
  "That may be the reason it was put there. But it was put there.",
  "And that's the crucial fact. It is either there or it is not there. And if it's there, it doesn't seem to me to make any difference why they chose to put that one there as opposed to other ones that they didn't put there. It's either there or not.",
  "Yes.",
  "I -- I don't understand.",
  "What basis would there be to -- to deny that?",
  "Firearms kill people is what the States say, and -- and we ban it.",
  "Other countries have done that.",
  "But if they did do it, I think you’d have to say it's perfectly okay.",
  "Yes. The reason is guns are dangerous.",
  "They said that is the reason it was codified. They did not say that that is the function of what was codified. The function of what was codified was to enforce the traditional right of the people to bear arms.",
  "And to say that that wasn't the reason it was codified doesn't say anything about what it consists of.",
  "Mr. Feldman, let me take your argument at -- at its face value. Let's assume that the only reason it is there and the only purpose it serves is the militia purpose. Isn't that militia purpose just as much defeated by allowing the States to take away the militia's arms as it would be by allowing the Federal Government to take away the militia's arms?",
  "Then so --",
  "-- even if you assume that the whole thing turns around the militia prologue, that prologue is just as -- just as important with respect to the State's depriving the people of arms.",
  "You’re switching horses now.",
  "Let's just focus on your argument that -- that -- that deals with the prologue. You say this is different because of that prologue. But that prologue has just as much force if the States take away the militia's arms as if the Federal Government does.",
  "Eleven of the colonies had a guarantee at the time the Constitution was adopted, and I believe something like 44 States currently have in their constitutions protection of the right to bear arms.",
  "Does that suggest anything about -- about how fundamental it is generally?",
  "\"Subject to such regulation\" certainly excludes banning them entirely, which is what you assert can be done.",
  "What's the purpose of a State constitutional guarantee which has at the end of it \"subject to such regulation as the legislature may proscribe,\" if that regulation includes banning it entirely? That --",
  "-- would make a nullity of the constitutional requirement.",
  "And is that what you’re asserting here --",
  "-- that the States have to allow firearms?",
  "Is that --",
  "I didn't think so, either, so --",
  "-- why does your last argument make any sense?",
  "That's fine.",
  "We said as much in Heller.",
  "Handguns in the home?",
  "Handguns in the home? That's what Heller addressed.",
  "No, you can't, because they didn't.",
  "See, the right to keep and bear arms is right there. It's right there in the Bill of Rights. Where do you find the right to self-defense?",
  "You -- you want us to impose that one on the States but not -- not the explicit guarantee of the right to keep and bear arms. That seems very strange.",
  "The District of Columbia did. That’s what Heller said.",
  "What you’re urging is really a mixed blessing for gun control advocates. To the extent we sever the Federal guarantee from what the States are obliged to comport with, we encourage a stricter Federal Second Amendment, one that forbids all sorts of regulations that the Federal Government might otherwise be allowed to do, because it doesn't matter -- the States can take care of it. I mean, you know, if -- if you sever the two, you’re encouraging a broader prohibition at the Federal level, and that's what -- Heller was very careful not to impose such a broad prohibition precisely because it realized that -- that this is a national problem.",
  "It doesn't trouble you.",
  "Of course, I don't look to see what Congress intended. I look to see what the statute says. I don't know that we -- we -- we psychoanalyze the text of a statute on the basis of what the Congress at that time knew. The text says what it says.",
  "That’s what it says.",
  "Of course, we're -- you know, we’re talking here as though Congress is a perpetual unchanging institution. Why would it have done this for Public Health Service employees and not have done this for Bureau? It wasn't the same Congress that passed those two Acts. The one may have been a stingier Congress than the other, or there -- there may have been more lobbying by one of the other groups in one case. I don't see any reason why we have to philosophically reconcile the -- the granting of -- of greater immunity to Public Health Service employees.",
  "Just as a matter of curiosity, do all of these immunity provisions come out of the same committee? Or can one assume that the Public Health Service may have come out of one committee of Congress, the Bureau of Prisons may have come out of another committee of Congress, the DOD may have come out of a third committee of Congress?",
  "You claim the Westfall Act implicitly repealed 233(a)? Is that what you say?",
  "Well, that provision says that it's exclusive, and you’re saying the Westfall Act says it’s not exclusive.",
  "But it isn't just made superfluous. It is repealed. The provision of it that says \"it shall be exclusive\" is repealed.",
  "Implicitly, because it's not specifically referred to.",
  "Well, you say any -- any other civil action that -- that did not exist prior to the enactment of 233(a) would not be covered by its exclusion because Congress couldn't have known that this civil action existed, so that it only covered those causes of action that existed at the time the statute was passed?",
  "Why? Why? I mean, if your theory is it doesn't preclude anything they didn't know about, if they didn't know about something, whether it's constitutional or not, what -- what reason is there to say it's precluded?",
  "Legislative history will do, so -- so we don't require this clear statement, right?",
  "Legislative history will do the job, so you’re abandoning the -- the proposition that there has to be a clear statement by Congress.",
  "That's what you said. I thought you said if -- if it was clear from the legislative history that Congress considered Bivens actions and nonetheless enacted language similar to 233(a), that wouldn't be enough.",
  "Now you’re confusing me again.",
  "Is -- is -- is important what Congress was thinking or what Congress said? I thought your proposition was, unless the statute says that it bans constitutional actions, it doesn't. Is that your proposition?",
  "Then it doesn't matter what Congress was thinking, does it? Unless Congress says that, your -- your position is --",
  "But, ah, but if it doesn't unambiguously bar it, you can then look to legislative history and say although it didn't bar it, the legislative history shows that it was intended to bar it.",
  "You are abandoning Carlson then.",
  "I thought Carlson was your big case.",
  "You just abandoned its proposition that there has to be a statement in the statute.",
  "Is head of state immunity implicit in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act as well?",
  "So why can't this be a -- a different body of common law?",
  "No. I mean, you’re saying they -- they left head of state immunity to the common law, did not incorporate it in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. Why -- why should I believe that they did not do the same for -- for agent of state immunity?",
  "Can -- can you get to the text of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that you -- that you assert embraces this personal immunity?",
  "Can I come back -- can I come back to the text? I -- just for a moment there we were on the text of this Act --",
  "-- that the suit is about. And you said where -- where the immunity exists is at 604, which says a foreign state shall be immune, but 1603 defines a foreign state, which -- which says that it includes an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state. And then it defines agency or instrumentality in a way which, it seems to me, does not include private individuals, but rather just artificial legal persons.",
  "Well, I -- I would find it extraordinary that it would go out of its way to say that it includes the Department of Defense but would leave up in the air whether it includes the Secretary of Defense. I mean, I -- I -- it seems to me much more likely that you would understand a foreign state to include the departments of -- of that state than that you would assume a foreign state to include individuals who happen to be officials of the state.",
  "And there was no uncertainty about -- about individuals?",
  "Well, entitled to it, or -- or able to obtain a letter from the State Department that would confer it upon them?",
  "I mean -- well, I mean, prior to the FSIA, you -- you had to get it from the State Department, didn't you? Even the state, for that matter?",
  "And what -- what if the State Department came in and said no, no sovereign immunity here, what would the court do? Would the court be bound by that?",
  "So they didn't have to say yes, but if they said no, that -- it pretty much carried the day?",
  "Well, you -- you don't assert that to be -- to be the law now, do you? Has -- has that been carried forward --",
  "-- under the FSIA?",
  "Ms. Millett, I think it's a pretty empty statute as well to interpret the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to immunize the Department of Defense, but not the Secretary of Defense. I mean, that seems very strange.",
  "The -- the Ministry of Defense is not the whole, either. I mean, you -- you acknowledge that -- that each individual piece of a foreign sovereign acquires the immunity, but somehow not -- not the principal officers of -- of the sovereign entity. That seems to me very strange. I mean, I guess -- I guess you could write it that way, but I don't know why anybody would want to write it that way.",
  "Excuse me. The -- the mechanism it provides is judicial determination of these questions that -- that you say have to be determined -- whether he was acting within the scope of authority and all that stuff.",
  "Isn't that what it did? It took it away from the Executive, gave it --",
  "No, I gather the --",
  "-- the State Department asserts the right to say: Yes, he was acting in a -- in an official capacity, but sock it to him.",
  "I mean, the -- the State Department wants to be able to decide whether individuals will be held liable, whether they were acting in an official capacity or not; isn't that it?",
  "I must say --",
  "-- that I find it much more acceptable to have the State Department say that a particular foreign country should be let off the hook, which is what they used to do with the Tate letters, than I do to leave it up to the State Department whether -- whether an individual human being shall be -- shall be punished or not. I -- I somehow find that less within the realm of the -- of the foreign affairs power of the State Department.",
  "That's -- that's very nice. A few years ago, a Spanish magistrate allowed a lawsuit to proceed, as I recall, against our Secretary of Defense. And what you say is that that's perfectly okay. It's up to the Spanish government to assert that that suit should not proceed, and if it doesn't, it's perfectly okay?",
  "There were a lot of long sentences in there --",
  "There is another discretion that you don't seem to object to. You say that one -­ one way the debtor can get out of the bind that he's put in by the fixing of the confirmed plan is simply to move for a revision of the confirmed plan.",
  "What constrains the judge in allowing or not allowing the revision? Doesn't he have the same kind of discretion with regard to the revision that you're objecting to with regard to his establishing the payments?",
  "But that's the same thing that's being argued here, that -- that you start with the fixed calculation based on the 6 months before and then you have to show that there were some extraordinary circumstances that justify a change. I don't see that there's any difference.",
  "What your case comes down to is the bankruptcy court can do this, but it has to do it by simply revising the plan, not by establishing the plan initially but by revising it.",
  "Maybe?",
  "That was a friendly question.",
  "Can I -­",
  "Can I come back to Justice Ginsburg's question about whether there would ever be the opportunity to adjust the confirmed plan? Because as you say, the plan here would not have been confirmed, but that -- that isn't the case always. I mean, in many cases a plan would be confirmed because the -- the bankrupt could -- could barely make the payments that it requires; and then when it -- it is clear that, because of the extraordinary event in the preceding 6 months, the bankrupt is -- is not going to have that -- that amount of money, there would be the opportunity to adjust.",
  "In other words, is your response to Justice Ginsburg \"always,\" that it will always be the case that where there would be an adjustment under this theory, there would not have been a confirmation in the first place?",
  "Can I ask -- yes, there is one more question.",
  "Can I ask whether 1323, which you have now invoked, does not provide the same kind of discretion to the court that you are objecting to? What -- what standards are there for granting or not granting modification of the plan? Is it pretty much up to the judge?",
  "Well, then -- then -- okay. You are between a rock and a hard place. Either 1323 gets you out of that formula, which is what you've said, it's one way out, or it isn't. Which is it?",
  "Okay. So any -- any amendment has to relate to a period -­",
  "-- subsequent to the filing.",
  "You -- you -- you have lost me.",
  "Where is the 6-month -­",
  "No, I got -- I got it there.",
  "I -- I -- I see. I see.",
  "Well, \"know will happen\" is quite different from \"likely to happen,\" and I thought your test was likely to happen.",
  "Not -- not likely, based on what you know. Well, that's quite different from you know it will happen.",
  "Is there a difference between your test and the Respondent's test?",
  "That's -- that's \"know will happen.\" That is \"know will happen.\" But I don't know how you can, at one and the same time, say: Courts shall not speculate, and then say that the test is \"likely to happen.\"",
  "I mean, to -- you know, to look forward and say: Is it likely or not likely? That's speculation. I don't know a better definition of speculation, to tell you the truth.",
  "On the other hand, until the Administrative Procedure Act was enacted, which -­ which eliminated all prudential bars to standing -- it clearly was the law that you could not complain about preference, unlawful preference, being given by the government under regulatory provisions to a competitor. The law was: That's tough. There was no standing. And that was a prudential law, I assume. And I don't know why it's any different from the tax law.",
  "Yes, but this -- but this doctrine, I -- I am not very sympathetic to that argument because this is a doctrine that is directed to the State collecting taxes, not to interfering with State regulation. That -- that's a different doctrine.",
  "I think your -­",
  "I think your answer is that relief that would violate the Tax Injunction Act is not appropriate relief.",
  "And therefore not covered by your plea.",
  "Makes sense to me.",
  "Your next-door neighbor has to be a competitor of yours before it would be an exact parallel, right?",
  "Counsel, I -- I hate to introduce another procedural glitch into this thing, but as I -- as I understand it, the State's motion to dismiss was under -- under 12(b)(1), which is a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and that was granted by the court. The TIA is assuredly a jurisdictional statute, but I had never thought that the comity doctrine was a doctrine of jurisdiction. In fact, by -- almost by definition it says the court has jurisdictions but nonetheless should decline to exercise any. You didn't make that objection, though.",
  "You did not make that objection.",
  "All threshold non-merits questions are jurisdictional questions?",
  "What is the case you're citing.",
  "Do you have a volume anywhere?",
  "Okay.",
  "Okay, fine. It can be answered before jurisdictional questions, but you moved to dismiss for want of jurisdiction.",
  "And -- and that is not a basis for dismissal here. The -- the basis is failure to state a claim, I guess, on which a Federal court can grant relief. But I -- anyway.",
  "That is so -- okay.",
  "Is it your position that all of the actions of the board, including those taken by the regional offices and by the general counsel and by everybody else, is inoperative once -- once the membership falls below three?",
  "Well, it has a separate -­ a separate authorization for these three -- three-person adjudicatory panels as well, doesn't it?",
  "Okay. But that's a different argument from the argument you were starting off with, which, as I understood it, was once the membership of the board falls below the quorum of three, by reason of that, the three -- former three-member panels, of which there are now only two left, cannot act. Is that your argument?",
  "The membership of the board?",
  "The membership of the board?",
  "I understood that argument and I thought that was the only one you were making. But you are making a broader one, that it also happens whenever the -- whenever the board's quorum disappears.",
  "So the regional offices can't function, of the NLRB?",
  "Can the board pay salaries?",
  "I'm really reluctant to rely upon this first argument that you are making, because I really don't know what it does to all of the functioning of the board.",
  "I didn't understand that. Would you -- would you make that argument again?",
  "Isn't there another difference? Is it not the case that the decisions of these panels can be appealed to the full board? Are they automatically final? Can the board not revise the decision of one of its panels?",
  "You've got to tell me more than you believe it. What is the case?",
  "The adjudication is final.",
  "There is no appeal to the full board?",
  "That's -- that's a totally different argument from the one that relies upon the size of the board, right?",
  "Even if the board were still properly constituted and had a full five members, if one of the three members to a -- a board should die, it would no longer be a three-member board and could no longer be, as your argument goes, the recipient of the delegation, right?",
  "Well, you are shifting arguments. You can't keep jumping back and forth between the two arguments. The one is that the appointing body has to still be fully constituted, or at least have a quorum, and the other one, which I thought Justice Alito was addressing, is the quite separate argument that the recipient of the delegation has to be three. And when it falls below three it's only two. And I don't know that you have a response to -- to -- to his point, with respect to the latter argument, except -- except that it's a different statute.",
  "If there is no legislative history, it could be true.",
  "What's the use of having a five-member board, then? I really don't understand what -- what has been accomplished -­",
  "-- if you have a -- you are changing, oh, we had a three-member board, that's no good, we thought that's unfair. We are going to make to five. But then we allow the five to convert themselves to three for finally deciding all the cases. What -­ what has been accomplished?",
  "Nothing.",
  "What -- I am really confused now. Is it or is it not the case that the full board has the power to review a decision of one of these panels? Before you said no; before you said it's final.",
  "But that is -- that is my question, whether they -- they can review it before it is rendered, is that what you are saying?",
  "They can review it before it is rendered. Okay.",
  "Just before the third member no longer became -- no longer was a member of the board.",
  "So knowing when it gave it to this three member panel that it would shortly become a two-member panel, and that thereby the board would be able to act with only two members instead of with three, which is what the quorum requirement for the board is. I must say that seems to be a very strange procedure when you have a statute that says the board has to -- has to have three for a quorum. When the board sees, oh, God, we are about to lose our third member, let's set up a three-member panel with this guy who's about to go off. It will immediately become a two-member panel and then we can act with only two members. That's wonderful. It doesn't seem to you like an evasion of the whole purpose of the -- of the quorum requirement?",
  "Well, don't -- don't you think it is significant that the -- the vacancy clause that you were discussing -- where is it? It's in (b). \"A vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board.\" And it says nothing about a vacancy in the group not impairing the power of the group.",
  "Which -- which buttresses, it seems to me, the argument that when the group is no longer a group of three the delegation is no longer effective.",
  "Of the board.",
  "But it doesn't say that about the group. That's my point.",
  "No. The -- this whole passage distinguishes between the board and the group. I mean, it's -- it doesn't -- it doesn't mean the group when it says \"the board\" and the board when it says \"the group.\"",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "The quorum for the group should be three, then. Right?",
  "It depends. I mean, if shutting down is the only way to put pressure on Congress to -- I mean, you may have a Congress that is just delighted to have only two Democratic members left on the board and all the cases decided by two Democratic members. What possible incentive does that Congress have to increase the board to -- to the level that it should be? None. If you want to solve the crisis that you are so worried about, the only way to solve it is to say: Boy, you know, there is -- it's Armageddon coming; we are going to not be able to act at all. That would solve the crisis.",
  "I'm much more impressed by -- by your opponent's assertion, which I don't think you have contradicted, that for many years whenever there was a death in one of the three-member panels, that panel was reconstituted. A new person was appointed, instead of just letting it continue to operate with only two. Doesn't that mean something? Doesn't that suggest that these panels were viewed by the board as requiring three people?",
  "But they never did it when they had a full board?",
  "Whenever there was a death of one of the members of a three-judge panel or a three-member panel, they filled it and the panel did not operate with two?",
  "Even though it could have, even though the quorum provision was just as it is here.",
  "Those panels did not operate with two?",
  "Do -- do we have any notion when -- when the board will reduce to one?",
  "When -- when -- when is one of the two's term over?",
  "Of this year. At which point there will be some pressure on Congress, I guess, right?",
  "Excuse me. Just the -­ just the representation cases, not the unfair labor practice cases?",
  "Wouldn't the -­",
  "Yes, I understand.",
  "Yes, but not --",

  "Your client is the first rail carrier to receive, right?",
  "Excuse me. What -- what are you referring to now?",
  "But why -- why doesn't the (2), (a)(2), the delivering rail carrier -- if what you say is true, that should be the delivering rail carrier delivering in a -- in an adjacent foreign country.",
  "That -- that limitation is strangely missing from (2).",
  "Okay. Wait a minute now.",
  "The paragraphing you say is wrong?",
  "Right.",
  "So all -- you’re saying that -- I think what you’re saying is that all we have to use the statutory statement that nothing was meant to be changed or is to say, well, that paragraphing in 3 is just wrong, right?",
  "The indentation.",
  "I'm losing you. 73a?",
  "Okay.",
  "What are you arguing, estoppel?",
  "Which one is right? That's what we are concerned about.",
  "Which one is right? Their earlier position or their current position?",
  "Why don't you speak to that rather than the fact that they had an earlier position?",
  "Wait. Excuse me. You say we have to defer to a letter --",
  "-- brief in another case? I think most of my colleagues would not defer to a letter brief in this case. And you’re saying that we owe deference to a letter brief in another case?",
  "Mead, which I didn't agree with, it seems to me --",
  "In another case?",
  "In that case.",
  "Do we have a brief here?",
  "Right.",
  "Can I ask you a question about -- about whether -- whether the shipper becomes a rail carrier? Suppose it's not 3 to 5 miles. Suppose the -- suppose the American rail carrier is waiting right at the foot of the wharf, and all these wharves have rails that go out to the ship, okay? And let's assume that that's owned by the -- by the shipping company. And a crane takes the -- the goods off of the ship, puts it on a -- on a car that rides along those rails for a couple of hundred yards. Is that enough to make the shipper a railroad?",
  "And you say here they own rail lines that --",
  "-- that go for --",
  "Excuse me. Before you get beyond that, what you are talking about here is the judgment under which he is being held in custody, right?",
  "And that -- even if you divide it, that judgment hasn't changed.",
  "He is still -- even -- his sentence has been altered and it's sent back for resentencing, but he is still being held in custody under the same judgment.",
  "That's true. But -­",
  "Excuse me. The reason Lawlor doesn't work is what you have there is different acts. The later judgment is -- is not just a later judgment with respect to the same act. It's a later judgment with -- with respect to a different act. Here you are saying you want to apply the same rule with respect to a later judgment, redoing the judgment for the same prior act. And I don't think that the same rule has to apply.",
  "Not the identical thing. The last one was for the smoke that went last year. The next one is for the smoke that went this year.",
  "The same act of his. I'm talking about the act that is the basis of the lawsuit.",
  "It's the very same act.",
  "Well, wait. First -­ before you get off whether this is second or successive, although the -- the State didn't put it this way, I think what the State is clearly saying is that if it is the second petition that could have raised this issue, it is second or successive. What's wrong with that?",
  "Why doesn't that fit -- fit the statutory language?",
  "It doesn't use -­",
  "-- it doesn't use \"judgment,\" either, and -- and -- and you are -- you are dragging in judgment as the -- as the -­",
  "Okay. So if -- if this is the -- if this is the second time that this claim could have been presented, it's a second -- it's a second or successive claim.",
  "What -- what would happen if it had been sent back on this ground, but there was another ground that he had appealed on which the Court never reached?",
  "Okay. Would he still be able to raise that one on habeas?",
  "Well, he'd have to bring them all in petition, too. You can't say, you know, there are five that weren't reached and bring a separate habeas reach for each one of the five. At first habeas, you would have to bring all of them, right?",
  "I guess if res judicata applied, you wouldn't bring habeas in the first place on an issue that was wrongly decided, right? If it was decided res judicata.",
  "And so your -- your habeas claim would be barred.",
  "I guess there's also the issue of whether, if everybody is agreed that it is not a jurisdictional question, that's the end of the case. I mean, as I recall, the other side says we shouldn't get to the merits.",
  "But you are not -- you are not pressing that?",
  "Well, it seems to me that isn't worth anything, right? I mean, that's -- they haven't conducted a rulemaking or anything.",
  "They just -- just appeared in court.",
  "Right.",
  "Except that they don't come out on your side anyway, do they?",
  "We are only talking about this case. I mean -­",
  "We are only talking about this case, right? If we send it back, we send it back to have this case decided and they'd come out against you in this case.",
  "So what could -- and that is going to change the Second Circuit's view of things, the fact that, in addition to their initial opinion, it has been reconfirmed, although on different grounds, by -- by the government?",
  "There is no reason to send it back.",
  "Well, but -- but Australia says: Look, it's up to us to decide whether there has been a misrepresentation, point one; and whether it's been relied upon by the -- by the plaintiffs, point two. And we should be able to decide that and we don't want it decided by a foreign court. You are talking about a misrepresentation, if there was one in this case, made in Australia to Australian purchasers; it ought to be up to us to decide that issue; and here you are dragging the American courts into it.",
  "Not to these plaintiffs.",
  "You -- you have to join the misrepresentation to the plaintiff.",
  "The only misrepresentation to these plaintiffs was made in Australia by an Australian company.",
  "But that -- that isn't the issue. The -- the -- the issue for the Australians is: We want to determine whether there has been a misrepresentation or not.",
  "We don't want the determination of whether there has been a misrepresentation on the Australian exchange and whether Australian purchasers relied upon that misrepresentation to be determined by an American court.",
  "Well, what is your test for whether -- whether it's being applied internationally or not?",
  "I'm not sure how you interpret the language that you -- that you just read, when you say to use or employ in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on the National Security Exchange or any security not so registered. Now, is it your point that in order to avoid an international extension of it, it should apply only to securities? What?",
  "Securities purchased and sold in the United States? Is that it?",
  "What if it's not -- what if it -- what if the fraud produces neither a purchase or a sale but induces somebody to hold on to stock that otherwise the person would dispose of?",
  "Well, is that your only point? Or is your point also that you wouldn't need section 30 if -- if 10(b) were -­",
  "-- were read as broadly.",
  "Schmidt is the German. He's in Germany.",
  "I am frankly less concerned with your -- your test for the private cause of action, the direct cause test -- I -- I guess I could work with that -- than I am with your test for -- for the jurisdiction of the -- of the SEC, which is sort of a totality of the circumstances test. It doesn't seem to me that's an appropriate test for a jurisdictional question. You don't want to spend time litigating the totality of the circumstances.",
  "Well, okay.",
  "I guess we don't have to say anything about -- about what the government can do, do we?",
  "She might have been sneezing. I mean, we don't know what caused the pause, do we?",
  "What if, in fact, there isn't -- what if both Counsel say, no, you should not declare a mistrial? Can the judge go ahead and declare a mistrial?",
  "That's not a very big fact.",
  "Was there an objection here by counsel for the defendant?",
  "Mr. McGormley, is it your burden to answer that question? Given AEDPA, is it up to you to show that this case is within the mainstream or is it up to the other side to show rather conclusively that it is not in the mainstream? I thought that's what AEDPA required.",
  "It is Petitioner's burden to show that there are cases like this, where I guess to show that uniformly in cases like this, there is no discharge of the jury. And I'm not aware that they have carried that burden. But we will ask when they come up. It is their burden, however.",
  "But again, that's --that's not your burden. We are operating here under a statute which says: \"In a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct. The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\" Now, what is the factual determination that has been made here? I assume it's the factual determination that the jury was deadlocked.",
  "And that has to be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, correct?",
  "Why didn't you answer that to those questions.",
  "Mr. McGormley, what evidence was there to the effect that the jury was not deadlocked?",
  "Which is presumably what the other side has to prove by clear and convincing evidence, if -- if we accept the factual finding of the State court.",
  "Ms. -- Ms. McCowan, you are -- you are arguing the case as -- as though the -- the only question for us is whether it was an abuse of discretion by the district judge -- by the trial judge here. That would certainly be the case if this is coming up through the Federal system and we had a Federal trial judge who had made this determination, but it is not. It -- it is coming up from a State court and Congress enacted a statute designed specifically to reduce the interference of Federal courts with -- with State justice. And that statute says specifically that where there has been a factual finding by the State court, it cannot be contradicted by -- by the Federal courts unless it is refuted by clear and convincing evidence. Now, what clear and convincing evidence is there here that there was not a deadlocked jury?",
  "Well, what was the basis for that declaration of mistrial?",
  "Right.",
  "The Michigan Supreme Court's determination is simply a determination of the same fact: There was a manifest necessity because the jury was deadlocked.",
  "I mean, that factfinding is implicit not -- not only in what the trial court did, but also in the Michigan Supreme Court's decision.",
  "But our -- but our cases have required much -- much more than that, much more than referring to a generalized standard that our opinions have set forth. They have required proving that the application of that standard in our opinions comports with the provision of the statute that requires you to show that the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to or involved in unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. Now, our cases don't show that you can simply come in and say, well, it's an abuse of discretion standard, that was clearly established by the Supreme Court of the United States, and therefore all I have to show is that this is an abuse of discretion. I don't think so. I think our cases show you have to show that the standard as applied by our cases does not cover your situation. And you don't have any cases like that.",
  "That may be. That may well be -­",
  "-- which says it's a terrible statute, but there it is. It says it has to be contrary to clearly established Federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. And you are saying, no, it's enough if it's established by an unbroken line of lower court decisions. That's not what the statute says.",
  "Well, maybe that's right and maybe it's wrong, but the State courts thought that it was evidence of acrimony, which it could be. And you say: Well, it also couldn't be. That may well be. But we are bound to accept the factual determination of the State court, unless you can show by clear and convincing evidence that that's wrong.",
  "Don't waste your time. I will look for it.",
  "Don't waste your argument time. I will look for it.",
  "So the standard of review for setting aside a determination of the State Supreme Court is exactly the same as the standard of review for reviewing a Federal district court and a Federal court of appeals despite AEDPA? We simply look and see whether there has been an abuse of discretion. If there has, we set aside the State Supreme Court judgment?",
  "But it's objectively unreasonable, you say, whenever there has been an abuse of discretion by the -- by the trial court, right?",
  "So it's not just abuse of discretion; it's abuse of discretion plus something else? Plus what?",
  "But \"objectively unreasonable\" is already built into the criterion of abuse of discretion. You don't abuse your discretion if what you have done is reasonable, you know, within the ballpark. It seems to me you are doubling up here. I -- I don't -- I don't understand how it works.",
  "Do you always have to poll the jury, is that what you are saying is a requirement?",
  "I am not aware that you would always have to poll the jury, and I could see some real disadvantages to it as a matter of fact. It perhaps puts more pressure on those who are the -- the holdouts, it identifies, in some cases, whose are the holdouts. I'm not aware that that's a requirement.",
  "But it doesn't always mean that. I think you say somewhere in your brief that it always means that. It surely does not always mean that. Because in -- what is it, 3624 -- wait a minute, now. 3624(d) says that, \"Upon the release of a prisoner on the expiration of his term of imprisonment, the Bureau of Prisons shall give him clothes, money and transportation.\" Now there the expiration of his term of imprisonment does not mean the -- the assigned term of imprisonment. It means the assigned term of imprisonment less all the good time credits he has had.",
  "Unless you think they are supposed to give him his clothes, you know, several months after he leaves.",
  "Right.",
  "I'm not addressing that. All I'm -- look, it -- the text says \"upon the release of a prisoner on the expiration of his term of imprisonment.\" My only point is that that -- you have to acknowledge that that is a use of the phrase \"term of imprisonment\" that does not mean the sentence he was given, but rather means the sentence that he served.",
  "That's right.",
  "How can you earn the good time? I mean you only earn the good time if -- if you are a good prisoner for a year.",
  "So you are going to let him out 54 days before the year, even though he hasn't earned the good time in the year?",
  "What did he do? How has he?",
  "Exactly.",
  "Of course, the government contends it's none of the sentencing commission's business. It's up to the Bureau of Prisons. Isn't that the government's position?",
  "No, no, you don't measure -- I don't think that -- you -- you begin measuring on 311, but you measure 365 days from -- from 311. And if he has behaved well during all -- all of those 365 days, then you knock off another 51 days or whatever it is. And you begin the third year from then, but you give him another 365 days to determine whether he has behaved well.",
  "Right.",
  "He did. He did. You didn't give him the credit until he served the whole 365 days. At that point, he gets the credit and you count the second year as though it begins on day 311.",
  "Exactly.",
  "Except that they're not taking it off from the back end. They are taking it off from the next year. So that in the second year, if he -- if he behaves well for 365 days from 311 -- okay? He behaves well for the next 365 days. The next year will begin at 622. But then he has to serve another 365 days before he gets good time credit. And then the next year will begin three times 311: 933. And so forth.",
  "Isn't that right? See, he agrees with me. No, I'm not saying that's right. I'm saying that that's -- that is what he is proposing.",
  "Subsequent legislative history, so to speak, right?",
  "I mean, we -- we wouldn't allow that -- those of us who use legislative history don't allow a congressman to come in several years after the bill has passed and say, oh, by the way, the reason we voted for that is thus and such. We would kick that out. Why is it any different for an agency's subsequent statement?",
  "I don't think we sent cases back under Overton Park for an agency's description of history. I think we sent it back for the agency to give a reason for its rule, whether that's its current reason or its past reason. It -- it's the current reason that counts.",
  "You don't have to worry about me.",
  "I'm -- I'm willing to accept the -- the government's assertion here that that's the government's position.",
  "I don't think you are lying.",
  "Even Justice Breyer has got it! Whoa!",
  "It wouldn't say that. It just wouldn't do it. That's all.",
  "But it’s certainly a factor that if I were -- if I were on the Commission, I would certainly take that factor into account. Every time I make it retroactive, it’s going to reopen -- going to reopen the whole sentencing and -- and allow a Booker application where -- where it didn't apply before. How can I close my eyes to that if --",
  "-- if I’m making the retroactivity determination?",
  "Well, why do you -- why do you pick on -- on Booker as -- as not carrying over? I mean, if you say that there carries over from the prior sentencing his failure to raise the equal protection claim, why can't you say it's also law of the case that the Booker objection doesn't stand? It's law of the case. It was decided before Booker, and that's the law of the case as far as that's concerned.",
  "I have a better answer to Justice Breyer's question. You want my better answer?",
  "Sure.",
  "It's -- it's -- it's not -- it's not section 3582 that’s unconstitutional, and it isn't even the provision for being guided by a policy statement of the Sentencing Commission that's unconstitutional. It is the nature of the Sentencing Commission's policy statement that is unconstitutional. Surely, if the Sentencing Commission had a policy statement which said you will reduce it for white prisoners but not for black prisoners, that would surely be unconstitutional, right?",
  "And your point here is that the policy statement which says you effectively will disregard Booker is unconstitutional?",
  "That works, doesn't it?",
  "What -- what if the President reduces the sentence using his pardon power? He cuts it back; he cuts it in half. The Bureau of Prisons has to hold him for the full term of the imprisonment? No, that can't be true.",
  "So why is this any different?",
  "Why is this any different? I mean, there are obviously -- what it proves is that there are exceptions to that requirement that they hold him for the term of imprisonment. They -- they have to hold him for the term of imprisonment unless it has been shortened, right, by -- by pardon or remission of part of the term by the President or what the argument for the government is, or by application of this retroactive rule by -- by the Commission.",
  "I guess they also made a mistake in not applying Booker, right?",
  "But I -- I still don't understand how you fit into that your answer to the Chief Justice earlier that, in fact, the court can consider other factors in -- in 3553 when it's making the reduction.",
  "Yes.",
  "I see. But -- but I thought you said you could take into account good behavior in that determination? But that isn't -- that isn't a factor that would cause you to disallow the reduction. It's a factor that --",
  "Excuse me. He didn't make that argument, though. I mean, his -- as I recall, his only complaint was that he had been promised that -­ that he wouldn't be -- he wouldn't be prosecuted. And that was his only complaint below, wasn't it?",
  "Right.",
  "He made the constitutional claim below?",
  "Excuse me. It's not just the Southern District; it's also what, the State?",
  "I got you.",
  "That did puzzle me. I was wondering if there's -- if there's coordinate jurisdiction. Can the -- can the District prosecute for crimes that the Attorney General can prosecute for?",
  "And, of course -­ MS. FRANKFURT -- and who can nolle the case.",
  "-- the States don't have the same compulsion that the Federal Government has, which arises from the separation of powers. And -­ which -- which means that it is the executive that has the right to prosecute, and States are not bound by such a thing. And they can perhaps allow private individuals to prosecute, whereas the only exception we have made from the -- from the chief executive's authority to prosecute is Young, which is a very narrow exception, dealing with the Court's ability to protect itself from contempt of its orders. And here the court had nothing to do with the appointment of this private party, right?",
  "This wouldn't be allowed under Young. I mean, if Young made anything clear is you couldn't appoint as a prosecutor an interested party. And here is the most the interested party of all.",
  "So don't -- don't -- don't say that Young would have allowed it.",
  "Does -- does the Justice Department concede that the sovereign here is the United States? Does the Justice Department concede -­",
  "-- that there can't be a separate prosecutor from -- from the Assistant United States Attorney and that is the prosecutor for the District of Columbia?",
  "You don't understand them to be saying that?",
  "Okay.",
  "Is the District a territory?",
  "What do you mean? Not on their own -- not on their own behalf. I mean, that -­ that's a quite different issue. That's the issue that was decided below, whether -­",
  "-- whether a private interested party can be authorized to bring the suit on behalf of the sovereign.",
  "I understand, but you -­ you covered two things. You said whether a private individual can bring it on his own.",
  "Or whether a private individual can be appointed to bring it on behalf of the sovereign.",
  "And I thought it was only -- only the second of these that you say is out of the case. You say the first is out of the case, too?",
  "No.",
  "I don't know what you mean by \"in the interest of\"? On behalf of? Is that what you mean? Are you saying -- you acknowledge here that it is on behalf of the United States but you say it doesn't have to be in the interest of the United States, is that it?",
  "I don't know what that means. Are you asserting that this suit has been brought on behalf of the United States by your client?",
  "Gee, I have really lost you. What is going off in a different direction? Really?",
  "Well, okay. You're -­ you're asserting that this agreement with the United States Attorney cannot cover this case because your client was not acting on behalf of the United States, but rather in her private capacity.",
  "And that's perfectly okay, right?",
  "Some problems have no answers. I mean, that doesn't prove anything.",
  "Do you think that Congress could -- could set up a private organization to expend Federal funds -- we are going to abolish the Department of Education. And we are going to give its function to a private organization that will take care of all those things. No good, right?",
  "On -- on behalf of -­",
  "-- on behalf of the executive. You are looking for a section of the Constitution; I suggest Article II, Section 1, the executive power shall be vested in the President.",
  "And just as the executive power includes the power to expend funds appropriated by Congress, so also the executive power except in the -­ in the instance of necessity acknowledged by Young, which I think was wrongly decided anyway -- except in that one narrow instance, the -- the power to prosecute belongs to the executive.",
  "Oh, I don't think that's right. Private prosecutions were common at the time of the framing? You have got to go back a long way before they were common.",
  "You want to plea bargain with a -- with an interested party?",
  "Is that the situation here in D.C.? When the woman comes in, can the judge look it over and say, Ah, you don't have anything here; I'm not going to -- I'm not going to allow you to go ahead.",
  "How do you understand -­ how does the statute read? As I understand it, it's not up to the judge to decide whether there is enough there to allow her to go forward or to appoint somebody on his own. She is the prosecutor. It's up to her whether there is -­",
  "A hearing on whether she can prosecute or a hearing on -- on whether he's going to be guilty or not.",
  "Or pay $1,000 to your victim, which is me.",
  "Courts don't have the power to incarcerate people. I mean, if you are prosecuting for a criminal offense, you are exercising more than the power of the Court.",
  "But nobody asserted in Young that the prosecutor appointed by the court was only exercising the power of the court. Surely it was the power of the government that the -- that the prosecutor was exercising. Now, the court was given the power to appoint that prosecutor, but I would think it's extraordinary to say that there's nothing but the court's power in play.",
  "Then why doesn't an agreement by the United States not to prosecute carry the day?",
  "And I have to agree with you that to accept this argument that the prosecutor here is an agent just of the court, just of the D.C. court, not an agent of the executive?",
  "Well, I'm not making the argument.",
  "I don't know that courts have ever asserted that they themselves have the power to prosecute.",
  "Not on behalf of the court. On behalf of the government, and that's why Young said you should offer it first to the United States Attorney, and only if he won't bring it, then you can appoint somebody else to bring it. But the -- the prosecutor is not the court. My God. What a terrible situation. The prosecutor's the court, the judge is the court?",
  "Isn't it the case that only the U.S. Attorney can prosecute for this crime? Could the D.C. attorney general or whatever the name of it, what, counsel, prosecute for this felony?",
  "Because it's all up to the court; the court's the big prosecutor, right?",
  "You did raise, undoubtedly you say, the point that the only way in which she could be the prosecutor was as an agent of the United States?",
  "And that it was unconstitutional for her to -- to represent herself.",
  "I -- I -- I'm not sure I understand what you’re saying. You’re saying that his reentry was not illegal because his removal was illegal? Is that what you are saying?",
  "I see.",
  "But it doesn't have to be a State felony?",
  "The felony has to be a Federal felony, right?",
  "Punishable as a felony under the Federal Act.",
  "But this was punishable as a felony because it was his second drug offense. He was a recidivist. And although it was only a misdemeanor under State law, under the Controlled Substances Act he could be prosecuted for a felony, for a Federal felony. I -- I -- I don't know why that doesn't fit the statute.",
  "He can't be convicted of a Federal felony in a State court. He has to be convicted of a crime --",
  "-- which may be a misdemeanor, which would subject him to a felony conviction in Federal court under the Controlled Substances Act. And I think that's - that's what this is. He's convicted of a drug offense, and if - if he were prosecuted in Federal court, he would -- he was punishable as a felon --",
  "-- in Federal court under the -- under the Controlled Substances Act.",
  "Let's assume we’re not talking about immigration consequences. Let's -- let's assume we’re talking about an American citizen who has committed a -- a misdemeanor drug offense. When he is brought up under the Controlled Substances Act, even though he wasn't found to have been a recidivist by the State conviction, couldn't he be prosecuted under the Controlled Substances Act for a felony because in fact he is a recidivist?",
  "Yes.",
  "No, but -- the crucial word here is \"punishable\" as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act. And the fact is if indeed he’s a recidivist, he could be punished for the -- for the felony. Now, you’re quite correct that the Federal court would have to find the recidivism, but -- but still he would be punishable as a recidivist.",
  "And we've held that’s okay --",
  "-- that you don’t need a jury.",
  "How do you --",
  "How do you distinguish Nijhawan? I mean, there what made it a Federal felony was the fact that more than $10,000 was obtained from the victims. But that was not found in the -- in the State conviction. It simply was not.",
  "That's right.",
  "Right.",
  "No issue.",
  "Well, what about the $10,000? That --",
  "He was never convicted of having obtained by fraud more than $10,000 from the victim.",
  "You still had the word \"convicted.\"",
  "Which is what you’re relying on. That word was applicable there as much as it’s applicable here, and we did not require him to have been convicted of having obtained more than $10,000.",
  "Mr. Richland, a little earlier you referred us to page 152 and 156 of --",
  "Oh, the appendix to the petition.",
  "I guess we don't decide our -- our Fourth Amendment privacy cases on the basis of whether there -- there was an absolute guarantee of privacy from everybody. I think -- I think those cases say that if you think it can be made public by anybody, you don't -- you don't really have a right of privacy. So when the -- when the filthy-minded police chief listens in, it's a very bad thing, but it's not -- it’s not offending your right of privacy. You expected somebody else could listen in, if not him.",
  "I think it is.",
  "Is reasonable expectation of privacy a judge question or a jury question?",
  "Excuse me. You said they did get to the off-duty text messaging later?",
  "You know, if they were on duty 24/7, there weren't any off-duty messages, were there?",
  "Suppose we find a right of privacy. Is that the end of the case? I mean, wouldn't you also -- in order to sustain this lawsuit, wouldn't you also have to find that it was an unreasonable --",
  "What’s the government's position on the unreasonableness of the search?",
  "Maybe an easier way, huh?",
  "Mr. Dammeier, you could say the same thing about private phones. There are obviously circumstances in which whether you were making a call between certain times becomes relevant to litigation. So you could say that destroys the expectation of privacy? I'm not sure. I hope we don't say that.",
  "Well, to say that there’s an expectation of privacy in the desk doesn't say that every intrusion into that expectation of privacy is an unreasonable one. There could be that expectation of privacy and, still, for some reason -- let's assume there has been a theft in the building, and it's known that what was taken has not gotten out of the building. It's conceivable that that would be a valid reason to intrude upon the expectation of privacy, right?",
  "Well, why isn't this a proper circumstance?",
  "They didn't know which ones were private messages, did they?",
  "Not until they read them.",
  "Did -- did he know about that statute? I didn't know about it.",
  "Can we assume he didn't?",
  "And what difference would that make?",
  "I don’t see how it can affect his expectation of privacy, if he didn't even know about it.",
  "Ignorance of the law is no excuse, is what you’re saying?",
  "Well, what -- when you send a text message to somebody else, aren't you quite aware that that text message will remain confidential only to the extent that either the recipient keeps it confidential -- and he can disclose it -- or somebody else who has power over the recipient or over the recipient's phone chooses to look at it? Don't -- isn't that understood when you send somebody a text message?",
  "Well, so she should have understood that, you know, whoever could get ahold of his phone lawfully can read the message. In other words, I don't see that she's in a -- in a different position from Quon himself.",
  "Well, that's a different issue.",
  "You mean it doesn't go right to the other thing?",
  "Can you print these things out? Could Quon print these -- these spicy conversations out and circulate them among his buddies?",
  "Well --",
  "Yes, I didn't know.",
  "Suppose I sent somebody a letter and -- and I have privacy in that letter, and let's assume it’s intercepted at the Post Office, but I have also published the letter in a letter to the editor of the newspaper. I have written the following letter to Sergeant Quon. Do I still have a right -- a right of privacy in that letter?",
  "Well, but that's the situation here. The -- the central location that stores the message is one thing, but she's made -- made the message public effectively by sending it to Quon. Once it gets to Quon, she knows that Quon can make it public or that the employer can -- can find out about it.",
  "Right.",
  "Exactly. That -- and that's why you have the statute, because the Fourth Amendment wouldn't solve the problem, because you are effectively making it public by sending it to somebody whom you don't know is immune from disclosure. So, in order to stop the intermediary from making it public, you needed the statute. Otherwise you wouldn't need it; the Fourth Amendment would solve the problem, right?",
  "Mr. Richland, do you take any position on whether Jerilyn Quon, April Florio, and Steve Trujillo stand in the same position as Sergeant Quon insofar as this lawsuit is concerned?",
  "Why?",
  "Whoa, whoa. I'm not sure you’re doing the city a favor by making Arch the city's agent --",
  "-- as opposed to an independent contractor who is doing business with the city.",
  "You sure you want to live with that?",
  "Oh, okay.",
  "But doesn't -- doesn't the one -- isn't the all-comers policy broader than the nondiscrimination policy, so that if you comply with that you automatically comply with everything in the nondiscrimination clause?",
  "Yes, but -- but the latter, the nondiscrimination policy, you assert is -- is not viewpoint neutral, that it has a particular impact upon a religious organization; whereas, the other policy, the all-comers policy, applies to everybody, and that argument is not available to you.",
  "Well, you should -- if that was it you should have brought in some -- some evidence of different treatment of other groups. And there -- as I --",
  "There is none of that except your citation of the bylaws of two groups in your brief, as I --",
  "I wish you would. You are going to waste your whole time just discussing this stipulation point. Let's assume -- let's assume that --",
  "-- the latter is the policy.",
  "You could have --",
  "-- a student organization, I suppose, of that type. It wouldn't include many people. But if there were such an organization, I assume that they would have that -- that belief required, right?",
  "You say you --",
  "Where -- where is the stipulation?",
  "Wait a minute now. A diversity --",
  "This -- this was not the policy on the basis of which CLS was excluded; is that correct?",
  "It -- when they were refused participation in the -- in the student organization program, they were not told about the all-comers policy.",
  "Anyway, as I understand your argument on the all-comers policy, it is not an argument that -- that is based upon the religious nature of CLS. You would make the same argument of unconstitutionality with respect to the student Republican Club, wouldn't you?",
  "Or --",
  "This was the basis -- your distinction between status and belief was the basis for your saying that the original policy, whatever -- whatever we call it -- what is the name of it?",
  "The written policy -- when it forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was complied with by CLS because it would not discriminate on the basis of orientation, only on the basis of belief.",
  "CLS doesn't have any -- any belief that marriage is between a man and a woman?",
  "No, no, no, no.",
  "But he wants to marry --",
  "That is not an implementation of the nondiscrimination policy. I mean, the two policies are quite different. Now, are you telling us that the written policy is no longer operative?",
  "No, what? No, it's not operative or no, you’re not telling me that?",
  "Well, they stipulated that the policy exists. They didn't stipulate that it is -- is being faithfully applied by Hastings. What do you do about the -- the -- the two organizations' bylaws referred to in the -- in the Petitioner's brief, which clearly do -- conflict with the so-called all-comers policy?",
  "All of the bylaws --",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, they don’t say that.",
  "They don't say that.",
  "The -- the two are connected, though, Mr. Garre. Frankly, one reason why I am inclined to think this is pretextual is that it is so weird to require the -- the campus Republican Club to admit Democrats, not just to membership, but to officership. To require this Christian society to allow atheists not just to join, but to conduct Bible classes, right? That's crazy.",
  "And is there any other university in the country that has this kind of a policy?",
  "Where is that?",
  "Wait, wait, wait. Twenty years? Do you have any evidence that this policy, the one we’re arguing about now, that is to say, the all-comers policy, existed before CLS brought this litigation? As I recall, the only evidence in the record is a letter from the dean describing this policy after the litigation began.",
  "Teach Bible classes? Right?",
  "You have to let them teach Bible classes, too, right?",
  "Where -- yes, let's get back to this homosexual orientation. You say that that's established in the case.",
  "Can I ask about number 2, the -- the so-called line-drawing problem? Aren't you just letting yourself into even more line-drawing problems?",
  "I mean, the other -- it’s whether you were discriminating on the basis of one of the forbidden bases. But now you’re saying you can't discriminate on any basis, which means there’re going to be even more lines to have to draw. Why does it solve your problem?",
  "Could you talk about -- I had understood from your brief that CLS did not have a -- a policy of excluding people with homosexual disposition, but that it was only homosexual conduct.",
  "Well, you -- but your complaint said otherwise. Your -- your --",
  "Oh, okay.",
  "And the sentence is not final until then?",
  "And -- and what if -- what if the court does set a date for additional sentencing? Then it's not final until then, right?",
  "Well, what -- what do you do about the further provision that at any time later, if the government -- or the victim finds additional basis for restitution, so long as after discovering it, within 60 days after that, the victim can come to the court and ask for restitution? What does that do? Does that --",
  "I mean, doesn't that necessarily mean that there are indeed two final judgments? That -- that one has to be -- has to go up on its own, doesn't it?",
  "Where is that?",
  "Oh. Oh -- “a sentence that imposes an order” --",
  "-- “is a final judgment, notwithstanding the fact that” --",
  "Got you.",
  "Of course, the same thing would happen if the trial judge makes a mistake of law which causes the -- the defendant to be acquitted, so that he not only escapes the liability to the victim, he escapes any -- any criminal punishment. It happens all the time. The judge makes a mistake; society pays for it.",
  "Now, what -- what can the defendant do within that 90 days? He has to wait 90 days before he appeals the sentence that he has been given; is that right?",
  "That's 3 months that -- that he has to sit on his hands.",
  "Must take it into account --",
  "-- if you read 3553 the way it's written.",
  "I -- I have a question going just to that. It seems to me that if 3553, as -- as I said -- maybe you shouldn't have agreed -- requires the sentencing court to consider the totality of the sentence it’s imposing, including the restitution, that would mean that the judge cannot impose a sentence before the expiration of the 90 days; that is, has to wait until the restitutionary issue is resolved to impose the incarceration part of the sentence. No?",
  "Was it within the 90 days?",
  "The restitution sentence was after the 90 days?",
  "But it -- it -- it's sort of a ridiculous consequence that 5 years later, and the judge who tried the original case is dead. I think it's bad enough to have the issue of whether this victim suffered $100,000 damages decided by the judge, if that's what you’re going to be sentenced to, but at least it's being decided by the judge who tried the case. And under your proposal, it can be decided by some other judge who is just -- just pulled in, because the -- the trial judge has -- has been deceased. That doesn't seem to me to make any sense at all.",
  "Doesn't the statute establish time limits for filing an appeal?",
  "Does it -- does it state a remedy for it? I don't think so. But if you don't comply with the time limit, you're too late; you can't file the appeal.",
  "Same thing here.",
  "Let me see if I understand this. He has 14 days to appeal that. And if he doesn't do that, then later within the 90 days or even after the 90 days, a sentence of restitution is imposed, he can -- he can appeal that sentence of restitution, right?",
  "On the same grounds on which he would have appealed the -- the sentence of imprisonment, right?",
  "If -- if it's an error in the trial, he claims: I was innocent.",
  "No?",
  "What was that statute on imprisonment?",
  "I've got it.",
  "Even though there’s no amount given?",
  "Simply because when you state an amount, that amount can be amended later, that leads to the conclusion that you need not even state an amount? Do you do the same thing for imprisonment? You say: I'm going to send you to prison; I'm not sure how many years, but I'm going to send you to prison. Is that appealable right away?",
  "I understand that, but district courts don't always do what they are supposed to. And it seems to me a very strange result that you're --",
  "This criminal judgment of restitution -- I assume it's the judge who finds that the victim suffered so much money?",
  "Does he find that beyond a reasonable doubt?",
  "Just more likely than not?",
  "And it's a criminal -- it's a criminal judgment?",
  "Before you do that, tell me what the government appeal would consist of. The 90 days has expired --",
  "And you -- you tell me the court -- the court has no ability to impose restitution after 90 days.",
  "What's the use of appealing?",
  "And the appellate court says too bad --",
  "There is no time limit on the mandatory minimum.",
  "Well, you don't -- I didn't understand you to deny that the ticket made it very clear who operated the ship.",
  "Do you contest that?",
  "Well, why not? Don't you read the contract carefully before you bring a lawsuit?",
  "So you are -- you either are contesting or you’re not contesting that it's clear from the ticket. I had assumed it was clear from the ticket.",
  "So you had -- so then you had notice even before the suit was filed. It was on the -- it was on the ticket.",
  "Not -- not if you read the definitions on page 1. And if you are not going to read all 11 pages before you file suit, I would think you would at least read page 1. And that, it seems to me, made it clear.",
  "I thought that the only condition was that it had to arise out of the same event or transaction, which would give you much more running room than -- than what you assert.",
  "Mr. Bendure, can -- can I come back to your -- I'm not sure why it matters, but it seems to me you’re giving too narrow an interpretation, and I would not like our opinion to read any more narrowly than the statute allows. It seems to me that if you assert a different claim arising out of the same transaction, you would be able to amend. If you will look at (c)(1)(C), which is what you’re asserting here, right? (C)(1)(C) says, “the amendment changes the party or the naming of party against whom the claim is asserted, if Rule 15(c)(1)(B) is satisfied.” Then you go back to (1)(B) and it says, “the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out.” It doesn't say it has to be the same claim.",
  "I understand that. That's why I don't understand why you’re arguing a more narrow -- a more narrow interpretation.",
  "It seems to me you’re home free with (B).",
  "Oh, yes, but -- but those are the only things we -- we have to argue about.",
  "There’s no doubt that you are asserting -- even if you were asserting a different claim, it certainly arose out of the same transaction or event, didn't it?",
  "Okay.",
  "I think your wife made a mistake. I don't think you made a mistake.",
  "19a of the petition?",
  "I'm sorry. I -- I am not following it. Where -- where -- where --",
  "Yes. But he's talking about constructive notice --",
  "-- by -- by the defendant, not constructive knowledge by the --",
  "It says it includes stewards. What do you -- what do you say to that?",
  "It includes the stewards on the boat, according to your -- your friend.",
  "Now, that -- that assumes -- that assumes -- when, what is it, 1(C)(ii), \"knew or should have known,\" it says within the period provided by rule 4(m). Now, in the early part of that period, at -- at one point in the period you should have known. And at another point, because the answer was filed, you shouldn't have known.",
  "And you're relying on the fact that they filed an answer which -- I'm sorry -- that -- that you filed an answer which made it very clear to them what the situation was. But was there any point, any -- and all it takes I think is any point within that 4(m) period -- when you -- you knew or should have known?",
  "Assuming -- assuming the lawyer would just look at the cover before he files a lawsuit?",
  "I object to your relying upon the -- the answer as -- as establishing compliance with (C)(ii), because (C), in the prologue, says \"is satisfied, if within the period provided by Rule 4(m).\" And there is at least some point within that period before the answer was filed. And if, within that period before the answer, you knew or should have known that it was a mistake, it seems to me you lose. Do you understand what I'm saying?",
  "And the -- the only thing you could rely on for that short period before the answer is filed is simply the ticket, right?",
  "Well, you are reading \"within the period\" to mean \"throughout the period.\" It doesn't say “throughout the period.” It says “if within the period.”",
  "I think it's an important issue with respect to the statute. I don't think we can treat cavalierly whether \"within the period\" means \"throughout the period.\" That's one of the issues here.",
  "This is sort of an equitable rule, isn't it, this mistake? We're going to, you know -- equity takes account of such things. It seems to me very reasonable to say: If the mistake is egregious, it doesn't apply.",
  "It was the same in Hanrahan. There was a right to a certain process in the lower court, and the -- the person complaining achieved reversal. It was sent back and said: Do it right. Give this person the process that -- that he’s entitled to.",
  "As the Respondent points out, the position you’re taking is unusual for the government. The government is usually arguing against fees, because the fees are often assessed against the government.",
  "So long as you know that you’re making your bed and you’re going to have to lie in it --",
  "-- and you’re essentially saying that when there is simply a procedural victory, which happens all the time, when -- when an agency is -- is reversed in its procedure even though the -- the -- the petitioner here doesn't get any concrete relief until it goes back to the agency and may lose in the agency ultimately, you’re -- you’re content to say that fees are assessable in that situation, just by reason of the procedural victory.",
  "No, I'm talking about other prevailing -- I'm talking about other statutes that don't say \"prevailing party.\"",
  "Sure.",
  "I'm -- I'm -- I'm not sure it's reasonable to interpret an attorney's fee provision as having anything to do with trust law.",
  "It's -- it's a requirement of attorney's fees enacted by -- by the Federal Congress, and I -- I find that very artificial.",
  "Future claimants will not ask for summary judgment from the district court, presumably, in light of Conkright. They will ask that the case be remanded. So, in future cases, will they have obtained a victory?",
  "Well, we've -- we've already told them they can't get that.",
  "The claimant doesn’t -- doesn't really claim that. The claimant just says this was a wrong decision and they should do it correctly. And the claimant knows that all he's going to get from the district court is a remand.",
  "So he would not ask for money and, therefore, would be victorious, on your analysis. If all he asked for was a remand, he got a remand.",
  "What if --",
  "Well, it's a trust -- trust law is at issue here, is the government's assertion.",
  "I guess you could argue that on its face the agreement is so one-sided, so unconscionable, that one of the parties must have been coerced into signing it. I guess you could make that argument, can't -- couldn't you?",
  "Has -- has that argument been made here?",
  "Was the argument made that because it was so unconscionable, the employee must have been coerced into making it?",
  "I didn't think it -- it had been made.",
  "I don't agree with that. I mean, if -- if the argument is made -- I gather it wasn't made here, but if the argument is made that this agreement was not voluntary, and the evidence of that involuntariness is how outrageously unfair it is -- now, I'm not sure that that's enough evidence. You may need some other stuff as well to -- to persuade a court. But if that is the argument, that the one-sidedness is evidence that the agreement was not voluntary, I don't see how that's for the arbitrator.",
  "You don't think that could be used along with other evidence? I think all you’re saying is that it is not in and of itself enough, that every unfair agreement is not a coerced agreement.",
  "But you could use it as evidence if there’s other evidence supporting that. Couldn't you?",
  "I think you can answer that yes or no. Can you use that in addition to other evidence to show that the agreement was not voluntary?",
  "Do you agree that a contract cannot be unconscionable unless it was coerced, that a finding of unconscionability is the same as a finding of coercion? You don't agree with that, do you?",
  "Can you --",
  "Once again, has this argument been made here? I thought that the only basis was unconscionability. I suppose you could have made the argument that the contract is void because one of its essential provisions has been rendered unlawful and, therefore -- and is not severable, and, therefore, the whole contract fails. I suppose you could make that argument. That hasn't been made, has it?",
  "Can they make it here now? Can they make -- I mean, even if they had -- you know, even if there was no reason to make it in the district court, is the law --",
  "-- that since they didn't have an opportunity to make it in the district court, they can make it in the Supreme Court?",
  "Is that -- is that right? Is the arbitrator free to decide unconscionability in a vacuum without taking into account State law at all? And doesn't he get reviewed afterwards by the State court on the basis of a much more lenient standard than -- than if the court decided it de novo. But can he really disregard State law regarding unconscionability?",
  "No -- I mean, you -- I thought you were saying that if we allow this to go to the arbitrator, the arbitrator can simply disregard the question of unconscionability.",
  "And that's not my understanding. My understanding is that he's -- he is obliged to take account of State law regarding unconscionability, but it's going to be his call, as it would be the district judge's call if this had gone to court, whether in fact this is unconscionable. Afterwards, there will be court review. And if he has totally disregarded all State law regarding unconscionability, wouldn't -- wouldn't you have a basis to set aside the -- the arbitration?",
  "That doesn't mean -- does that mean he can disregard -- let's assume the contract is a contract to maim. I mean, it -- you know, it's -- it's like -- it's a Shylock contract, okay? He's going to be able to exact a pound of flesh. Now, there are State laws which invalidate contracts to maim. Do you think that the arbitrator can ignore that, and say, well, you know, I don't really think it's so bad; a pound of flesh sounds reasonable to me?",
  "Can he ignore the State law?",
  "Is that right? You don't think a State court would in the blink of an eye set aside an arbitration that allowed a -- a pound of flesh?",
  "I think you have a misunderstanding of the law, then, if that's what you believe. I -- I think there’s no doubt what would happen in that case.",
  "You wrote that, didn't you? Didn't you write that opinion?",
  "Let's assume Nevada law says you cannot -- you cannot fire somebody for coming in late to work any fewer than 10 times, all right? And an individual is fired. He goes to arbitration, or at least the company tries to take him to arbitration on it. And he says, no, because I was fired in violation of Nevada law. Now, is it your position that that -- that that case would have to go immediately to court and could not submit to the arbitrator the issue of whether indeed he was fired for coming less than 10 times, and indeed whether if he was coming in less than 10 times, that would be an invalid basis for a dismissal?",
  "Well, your -- your position seems to be that unconscionability is the same as coercion in the making of the agreement. And I don't know that that's true.",
  "No, I don't care what we --",
  "I don’t care what we said in dictum. It doesn't seem to me that unconscionability is the same as duress or the same as fraud --",
  "-- that you can -- you can be a stupid person who voluntarily signs an unconscionable contract. Now, the courts may protect you because you’re stupid, but you haven't been coerced. Is there no distinction between unconscionability and coercion?",
  "Why is that?",
  "Why is that? I would say all unconscionability challenges, if you have an agreement that’s as clear as this one, would go to the arbitrator. Which ones would have to go to the court?",
  "Not much use signing an arbitration agreement then, not much use for the employer. He’s going to end up in court anyway. Every one of them will be acknowledge as unconscionable. So what’s the use?",
  "I mean, kiss good-bye to arbitration.",
  "No?",
  "The amici certainly claim the contrary. The Chamber of Commerce claims that this is what’s happening and that it has been a snowballing effect.",
  "There --",
  "If there’s no access to arbitration, there’s no way that you can leave that issue to the arbitrator, is there?",
  "Because you never get to the arbitrator.",
  "Hay production out.",
  "Mr. Robbins, can I ask you about your clients’ standing? What individual plaintiff here stood to be harmed by what the agency had done? Which one of them was -- was within, what, 5 miles of any -- any field of the genetically engineered alfalfa?",
  "What? From what? From what? From --",
  "From somebody within 5 miles, 10 miles, 20 miles?",
  "So you want the Court to assume that somebody is going to be planting a field of the genetically engineered alfalfa within, what, 5 miles of --",
  "-- one of your named plaintiffs?",
  "The fact is there isn't a single named plaintiff who -- who has -- has any claim that within the utmost limits of -- of risk, he is at risk currently.",
  "I understand that. But you have to bring in a member from that organization --",
  "-- who is concretely harmed.",
  "You -- you don't think the free market would produce companies that advertise: We only cut natural seed fields?",
  "You don't think that would happen? I am sure it would happen.",
  "I am really losing you now. I thought he was referring to the number of farmers who would be planting and harvesting genetically engineered alfalfa. Isn't that -- farmers who wanted to do it. He was saying: We now have 200,000; we are going to have a million.",
  "All right. Acreage, whatever. He’s talking about acreage of farmers who plant and want to plant --",
  "-- genetically engineered seed.",
  "He’s not talking about how many unwilling farmers are going to have infected fields.",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, I'm not sure we understood.",
  "It seems to me pretty doggone imminent if the agency has come before the court and said: This kind of partial deregulation ought to be allowed, and we’re in favor of it. I mean, you are not sending it back to an agency that’s a blank slate. You know that the agency favors this degree of deregulation.",
  "I mean -- I’d -- you know, I -- boy, I’d take a remand to the agency any day.",
  "This isn't contamination of the New York City water supply. It's the creation of plants of -- of genetically engineered alfalfa which spring up that otherwise wouldn't exist. It doesn't even destroy the current plantings of non-genetically engineered alfalfa. This is not the end of the world. It really isn't. The most it does is make it difficult for those farmers who want to cater to the European market, which will not accept genetically engineered alfalfa. It makes it more difficult for them to have a field of 100 percent non-genetically engineered. But that's not the end of the world, Mr. Robbins.",
  "I thought you were comparing it to New York City dying --",
  "-- from poisoned water?",
  "And what happened with corn? You -- you -- you said -- gee, I was unaware -- I’ve been eating corn all this time.",
  "What happened with it?",
  "We -- we don't necessarily have to do that. We just have to decide whether the lower courts did it.",
  "I mean, if we concluded that they didn't do it, that would -- that would be enough, wouldn't it? We wouldn't have to do it ourselves.",
  "They also said stuff which suggests that they didn't do it.",
  "What -- what about requiring disclosure of campaign contributions?",
  "Do you think that is unconstitutional?",
  "Right. Now, why doesn't that fall within your principle that no person should be exposed to criticism for --",
  "-- his political beliefs?",
  "Mr. Bopp, do you have any case in which we have held that the First Amendment applies to activity that consists of the process of legislation, of legislating --",
  "-- or of adopting legislation? What is that?",
  "That is --",
  "Soliciting signatures is not taking part in the process of legislating.",
  "The person who requests a referendum is taking -- when there's a certain number of signatures required to achieve it, is taking part in that. And in light of the fact that for the first century of our existence, even voting was public -- you either did it raising your hand or by voice, or later, you had a ballot that was very visibly red or blue so that people knew which party you were voting for -- the fact is that running a democracy takes a certain amount of civic courage. And the First Amendment does not protect you from criticism or even nasty phone calls when you exercise your political rights to legislate or to take part in the legislative process.",
  "You are asking us to enter into a whole new field where we’ve never gone before.",
  "Not even just your name, so they can check that this thing isn't phony and that all the names on it aren't -- aren't made up by one person?",
  "Of course, they can. So they can get your name, right?",
  "Okay.",
  "But you’re objecting to the public being able to check whether the agency is indeed finding out whether this is a genuine petition or not, correct?",
  "Really?",
  "Didn't you have some options, too? Have you started a referendum to repeal the -- the California law that requires disclosure?",
  "I don't understand. I thought that’s what you’re challenging. The --",
  "I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
  "Washington. I got the wrong State.",
  "The people of Washington -- the people Washington evidently think that this is not too much of an imposition upon people's courage, to -- to stand up and sign something and be willing to stand behind it.",
  "Now, if you don't like that, I can see doing it another way. But -- but the people of Washington have chosen to do it this -- this way.",
  "And you’re saying that the First Amendment absolutely forbids that.",
  "That's fine. Proving my point.",
  "It might have been a good idea.",
  "What about just -- just -- what about just wanting to know their names so you can criticize them?",
  "Is -- is that such a bad thing in a democracy?",
  "But part of the reason is so you can be out there and be responsible for the positions you’ve taken.",
  "So that people -- people can criticize you for the position you have taken.",
  "What do you mean, \"both sides\"? The other side hasn't signed anything. When they sign something --",
  "When they sign something, they’ll be out there for public criticism as well.",
  "Oh, this is such a touchy-feely, oh, so sensitive about -- about any --",
  "You know, you can't run a democracy this way, with everybody being afraid of having his political positions known.",
  "Well, that's bad. The threats should be moved against vigorously --",
  "-- but just because there can be criminal activity doesn't mean that you -- you have to eliminate a procedure that is otherwise perfectly reasonable.",
  "So the country was acting unconstitutionally for a whole century before we adopted the Australian secret ballot? Do you really think that?",
  "That it was unconstitutional --",
  "-- for a whole century not to have a secret ballot?",
  "So you -- you would have no objection to as an-applied challenge to disclosing the names of individuals to a particular cause, where it is demonstrated that the opponents of that cause are violent and will do violence to the people who signed the petition?",
  "So this is just a general challenge to ever, ever disclosing the names of petition signers?",
  "Right.",
  "But -- but you -- you’ve rejected that here. You’ve said there’s no evidence here that any of the petition -- petition signers were subjected to any harassment.",
  "Of course there isn't, because the names haven't gotten out yet. How could you possibly demonstrate before the names get out that petition signers are going to be subjected to harassment?",
  "Or otherwise, don't insist upon evidence that these very petition signers will be harassed.",
  "And you think that would be an acceptable type of evidence?",
  "Well, if you don't think it's acceptable, then -- then -- then you’re not making an argument.",
  "Sometimes the public may not trust the Secretary of State.",

  "Isn't that information, at least the names of those people -- isn't it probably public information anyway?",
  "Can it be obtained under the Freedom of Information Act in this case?",
  "And -- and I suppose the prosecution can alter the consequence based on what it chooses to bring in a single prosecution. I mean, if it has other -- other enhancements, it should bring a separate prosecution for that. So long as it brings it in one suit, you say, in one prosecution, you get the break. But if -- if the other enhancement is brought -- has been brought in a separate prosecution, you don't get it.",
  "Yes. Yes, I understand what you're saying.",
  "So let's suppose somebody commits a rape and a maiming in the same -- in the same criminal act. You're saying that the prosecution -- and let's assume it's his third. It's his third violent crime. So he would get the enhancement as being, you know, a three-time violent crime loser. You're saying he could get that enhancement and the enhancement under this -- under this gun -- he had a gun at the same time. He can get it if the prosecution charges rape in one prosecution, for which he will get the three-time loser enhancement, and then in a separate prosecution, it charges maiming and the use of a firearm. Then he gets both enhancements, right?",
  "That seems -­",
  "Well, he's disagreeing with you. He -- your theory -- you're not reading \"crime\" to mean an affair in the world. You're reading it to mean a particular prosecution for a particular violation of a statute. Right?",
  "He wants to read it as an affair in the world, whatever that means.",
  "And there has never been the incentive to do so, until we accept your interpretation. Then there will be means to do so.",
  "Excuse me, before you go on. Your last remark -- it has to be a previous conviction. So why doesn't that leave it in the hands of the prosecutor whether to bring that conviction, that other case, prior or subsequent?",
  "But that would include (B). That would include (B). (B) is part of the same subsection, isn't it?",
  "So, you know, I -- I think what the Chief Justice says is very obvious when you are just talking about (c)(1)(A), but it isn't obvious to me that if -- if the firearm is discharged and in addition it's a machine gun or destructive device, that you'd only get -- you'd only get the 30 rather than the 30 plus 10.",
  "That isn't obvious to me. And -- and the \"except\" clause would -- would handle that.",
  "Where is 930(c)? Can you tell me where it is in the -­",
  "Wait, but it -- but it does -- it does subject them to less, at least with respect to those -- those enhancements set forth within the subsection itself.",
  "Why?",
  "And that's the only thing that that additional language which says \"otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law\" -- why didn't they just mention 3559(c)?",
  "That's the only thing it covers, that tiny little thing, which has no effect at all, except for the benefit of the busy district judges, you say. I -- I find that quite implausible.",
  "It's one witness at a hearing? At a hearing? And you really think that the rest of the Congress knew about that hearing?",
  "Well, wait. I mean, the guidelines can't be, as Justice Breyer said, just like a mandatory. They can't be, can they?",
  "Oh, you did. I quoted you.",
  "Advisory.",
  "Excuse me. For other provisions anywhere in the code? I mean, regardless of whether those provisions are being prosecuted in this particular indictment? I mean, you're -­",
  "You're saying that the other side has to say, well, it's only those that are in this -- in this particular criminal transaction, or only those in the particular indictment. Do you escape that necessity?",
  "Mr. Burke, isn't it -­ isn't it the case that, even on the other side's interpretation of it, it doesn't come down to actual costs anyway? Isn't it the case, or do I misunderstand it, that so long as there is one payment, you get the entire deduction?",
  "Even one payment of $1, you get the entire deduction. So to argue this case as though it's a question of whether you actually expend the money that you're getting the credit for is simply -- is simply false. You don't do that under either side's interpretation, right?",
  "I'm trying to help you, Mr. Burke.",
  "Excuse me. What -- what happens under the tax law? Do they make an adjustment under the tax law as well?",
  "A standard -­",
  "Right. So that they -­ what is suggested is that you look at it and apply the IRS's approach as to whether you get into the chart, but then you don't use the IRS's approach when the trustee takes you out of the chart. Is that what you think is the law?",
  "What's the language we're dealing with, Mr. Burke? Do you want to quote the language to us? Nobody's quoted the language. What does it say is applicable?",
  "Wait. The -- the applicable amounts specified where?",
  "Read the text of the statute, would you, please, for me? I couldn't even get it from your brief. You had to refer me back to the petition. Why isn't in an appendix to your brief or printed in the beginning of your brief, instead of kicking me back to dig out your petition?",
  "\"Amount specified under\" the standard.",
  "\"Applicable amounts specified,\" not the amounts specified if applicable.",
  "I don't understand what you're saying. He asked, are they split 50-50 on the point that is before us here? Yes or no?",
  "Of course, once again, Mr. Burke, this is -- I don't know why you don't point this out. This is not the difference between your position and the position of the other side. You get the deduction for the other side as well, whether or not you are making the payment. Now, maybe it can be adjusted by the trustee, but as far as the statute is concerned, so long as you make one payment of $1, under their theory you're entitled to claim the deduction; isn't that right?",
  "So.",
  "Is that -- is that by reason of the Internal Revenue Service -­",
  "-- manual, or is it by reason of the Bankruptcy Code itself?",
  "So it's in the chart -­",
  "-- that you claim -- okay.",
  "Is this a problem distinctive to your case? Doesn't the other side have the same problem with ownership? Don't they acknowledge that even if you are leasing the car you get the deduction?",
  "I don't see why this is distinctive to your case. It's a problem both sides face. And we don't avoid it by coming out against you, do we?",
  "I must say your position is more logical than the position that you read in some of the instructions applicable to the -- to the chart that's referred to in the Bankruptcy Code, but not others. I mean, it seems to me, if you're going to read in the requirement that have to have made a lease payment, you should also read in the requirement that you're referring to now, which would mean your deduction is limited by the -- by the amount of your lease payment. I don't see why -- is there any reason why one would read in the other one and not read in yours?",
  "Why aren't -- why isn't one of the criteria the -- the provision that says maximum allowances for housing and utilities and transportation, known as the local standards, vary by location, and unlike the national standards, the taxpayer is allowed the amount actually spent or the standard, whichever is less? Why doesn't that apply?",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "It's not applicable. It's not applicable if, in fact, you haven't spent that much. Just as you claim it's not applicable if you have no payment at all.",
  "It would have to go to 1,500 a month, or he, out of the goodness of his heart, would decide to pay that amount?",
  "Right.",
  "Fine. So why -- why would we assume that he -- I don't know -- your client is an extraordinarily generous fellow. I don't think most people, when they go through bankruptcy, are going to cough up any more than they have to.",
  "Forget about formality, in other words. Formality or no formality has nothing to do with it.",
  "That is -- that is what it says.",
  "It's the -- it's the -­ it's the purpose of the declarant, not of the questioner.",
  "What possible response to an ongoing emergency could he have had in mind? What possible response to an ongoing emergency?",
  "He was bleeding to death, and he could have said, you know, I'm bleeding to death. Now, that statement would -- would be, you know, suggesting an ongoing emergency. But giving the name of the person who shot him, where he was shot, what does that have anything -­ how does that have anything to do with an ongoing emergency?",
  "But he does.",
  "But he does.",
  "He knows -- he knows that his -- that the person that shot him is nowhere near there. He knows that -- that he drove, what -- how far away was it? Six blocks or -- a good distance from where the shooter was. He knows all of that. The only reason he could be giving the name of the person who shot him is so that person could be apprehended and punished.",
  "One way to evaluate those statements is what they are made in response to. If they are made in response to a certain type of police inquiry, they are more likely to be testimonial. And another kind -- you know, are you dying? They are more likely not to be testimonial. But it is ultimately the statements that -- that we have to evaluate, whether they are testimonial or not.",
  "Well, if it was an emergency, he wouldn't have asked, what happened? He would ask, what is happening?",
  "To ask what happened is to ask the declarant to describe past events, which is testimonial.",
  "And if you're worried about that, do you run immediately over to the person lying on the ground or do you examine the gas station first, rather than expose yourself to the -- to the shooter that you think is still in the gas station? The -- the behavior of the police here gave no indication that they thought they were in danger immediately and were interrogating this person in order to assess the danger to them. That wasn't what they were after.",
  "So at least whenever the police come upon somebody who has been the victim of a violent crime, whatever interrogation they conduct could plausibly be to -- to make sure that the person is not still nearby, and that testimony will always be admissible?",
  "No, no, no.",
  "Strike \"designed to assess the risk.\" You don't know what they're designed to do. These policemen didn't say we're assessing the risk. They just asked the questions. And that's what is going to happen in future cases. And you're saying, whenever policemen come upon a victim of violent crime and said who did it, what's his name, all of that will always be admissible because they -- they could be assessing the risk, right?",
  "Only when he's excited, right? Only when the victim who has been the object of a violent crime is excited. Or if State law doesn't apply and we're dealing with a Federal crime and Federal officers, right, and trial in Federal court? And in that case, what Justice Breyer just said would not apply.",
  "Do you distinguish between collecting evidence for a future prosecution and collecting evidence in order to pursue and arrest the felon? Do you distinguish those two? And you can say these police -- these policemen weren't collecting evidence for a future prosecution; they just wanted to know who the shooter was and where he was so they could go get him. Would that -­",
  "Would that not be collecting evidence for a future prosecution?",
  "But you say it has to be for the purpose of a future prosecution. Just -- just in order to an arrest and bring into jail the person who committed this crime, that doesn't qualify?",
  "When does that not exist in the case of a violent crime? When does that not exist?",
  "There's a violent criminal out there.",
  "Okay. So if you use a gun, a knife, or a machine gun, whatever the victim says gets admitted into evidence, because the police could -­ could be not -­",
  "-- not trying to get evidence, but just trying to safeguard society against the -- the felon on the loose?",
  "I thought that's how you just described it.",
  "Yes.",
  "Who did it.",
  "That's always the case. That's such a phony evasion of what the purpose of the testimonial rule is. That's always going to be the case, at least when there's a violent crime.",
  "And you may as well take Crawford and throw it out, in -- in the majority of serious cases, if that's going to be your rule.",
  "The crime was ongoing in -­ in Davis when -- when the woman was on the phone with the operator. It was ongoing. She was seeking help from the emergency that was occurring to her at that moment. There's nothing like that here.",
  "Will they ever know that?",
  "I mean, is that -- is that likely not always to be the case when -- when you come upon a person who has been the -- the victim of a violent crime? You could say it all the time. No, they didn't know where the -- where the offender was, so whatever this person says comes in as evidence in a trial.",
  "I think your answer, counsel, is that we decided that in Crawford, from which Justice Breyer dissented.",
  "That's what we said in Crawford, isn't it?",
  "Mr. -­",
  "Mr. Van Hoek, what is the basis for your concession that a dying declaration is an exception from the Confrontation Clause?",
  "It is an exception from hearsay, for certain, but from the Confrontation Clause?",
  "You conceded it. It's been the whole basis for Justice Ginsburg's subsequent interrogation.",
  "I thought it was an open question only -- only where the -- the defendant has effected the death of the person who has made the dying declaration. I don't know of any cases that allow a dying declaration in over a Confrontation Clause objection.",
  "If it hasn't been reached, if it is not an established exception to the Confrontation Clause, there is no basis for saying, therefore, the Confrontation Clause pertains only to reliability. It pertains to the opportunity to cross-examine. And -- and reliability exceptions are what we used to do under -- under Reynolds. If it was reliable, we let it in.",
  "And the mere fact that it's reliable as a dying declaration instead of reliable as something else ought to have nothing to do with the Confrontation Clause decision.",
  "The guy in the gas station is present. It's not past. He's making an assertion the guy who is now in the gas station shot me. The \"shot me\" is past, but he's asserting that the person is now in the gas station. That is a statement of a present fact.",

  "Roberts. I'm sorry.",
  "Roberts. I'm sorry. Roberts, which -- Reynolds was the Mormon case -- which was about 25 years old or so when Crawford was decided, yes, hearsay was your protection, and that was it. But if by what you mean is in the past, Crawford examined the past, and its conclusion as to what the past said is quite different from what Justice Breyer now says, although he joined Crawford.",
  "Well, they can always do it. You -- you don't say they can't do it.",
  "They can always ask the questions. The only issue here is not whether they can ask the questions, but whether, after they ask them, the answers can be introduced at trial.",
  "Would they ask his name? God, it's really important for us to know, four students on the ground. What's the name of the guy that did this? That's not the emergency.",
  "They'd say: Where is he?",
  "I don't understand what you're saying. You mean he has to intend to provide evidence that he knows will be used at trial? I don't think that's the test.",
  "He's intending to accuse somebody.",

  "Well, you could get the individual officer who's denying the marriage license or whatever the offensive act is. You could sue that person under 1983 and get -- and get injunctive relief, I suppose.",
  "It's the same statutory language that you're relying on, right, that was held to require causation in the one case? Why wouldn't it require a similar causation in the other?",
  "Or there is no city policy.",
  "But the test would be the same going forward, right? The test would be the same -­",
  "The same test would apply to both damages, going forward after the date of filing of the suit, and injunction according to your reasoning, right?",
  "From the time the suit is filed both -- the injunctive test will also be the damages test.",
  "Let me follow this. To bring a damages claim, do you have to show past damages, or can you just collect damages from the date you file suit?",
  "Well, in -- if that's the complaint that you file, then -- then in that kind of a suit the test for damages and the test for injunction would be precisely the same, and you would be able to get damages on the basis of the mere fact that the suit exists, right? Because they wouldn't be fighting it if it wasn't their policy.",
  "Mr. Pincus, why do you -­ why do you accept, as I think you did in response to the Chief Justice's question, that if the city has a policy which it believes is constitutional but in fact is unconstitutional, that is not a city policy for purposes of Monell?",
  "Well, I thought you did.",
  "Even if they think it's a constitutional policy, it's still a policy, isn't it?",
  "Mr. Katyal, what is the well-defined, the well-defined, constitutional right to institutional -- to informational privacy that the Government is -- is willing to acknowledge? You -- you apparently don't -- don't challenge the existence of such a constitutional right.",
  "It's a strange way to proceed. We normally don't do that, see? If there were a constitutional right, would it cover this?",
  "Do we do that in cases? I don't think so.",
  "That would justify not defining it broadly or narrowly. It wouldn't justify not reaching the question of whether there is any such constitutional right at all.",
  "We do have a legislature, don't we, that can place some limits on what the Government asks employees or anybody else?",
  "It's the same legislature that prohibited the Government from disclosing a lot of information, isn't it?",
  "And it's possible that that's the protection that the Framers envisioned, rather than having courts ride herd on -- on Government inquiries.",
  "Mr. Stormer, what provision of the Constitution are you relying -- I looked at your table of authorities in your brief, and you have cases listed, you have statutes listed; there is not a single citation anywhere in your brief to a provision of the Constitution. What provision of the Constitution are you relying on?",
  "I think it's a very nice thing that the Government shouldn't ask intrusive questions. I also think it's a nice thing that the Government should pay a living wage to its employees, but I don't feel authorized to go around saying how much the Government should pay each of its employees because there is nothing in the Constitution about that, and the question is left to Congress. What do you rely on in the Constitution that enables me to decide how much intrusiveness is too much, rather than leaving that to Congress?",
  "The Fifth Amendment? Okay. Which says no person shall be deprived of what?",
  "Due process of law.",
  "All right. That -- that's what I thought. You're talking substantive due process here.",
  "I mean, I like that, but I just don't see it anywhere in the Constitution. That's all I'm taking about.",
  "But we can handle those details. My goodness, it's all right there in the Constitution. And we can decide what -- what employees have to know what, and what questions you can ask them, and how much privacy is too much privacy, right?",
  "It's a piece of cake.",
  "Excuse me. I thought -- I thought that your friend said that the badge enables you to get within 10 feet of the shuttle?",

  "Does al-Qaeda know this?",
  "Why do you say a private employer could not ask a question of such detail? Why could not - -",
  "Why could a private employer not -- not do it?",
  "Well, you mean that legislatures take care of these matters? I find it curious that in order to establish a Federal constitutional right, which turns this area over to this Court, you invoke laws that have been democratically enacted by State legislatures. I mean, if indeed that's -- that's the criterion, maybe you don't need us.",
  "These are people who haven't gone to law school, right?",
  "And do not know that you cannot apply deadly force in most circumstances?",
  "If you were giving guns to lawyers, it might have been different.",
  "Depending on the law school they went to or what?",
  "I thought he asked that. So I was glad to see that. Thank you.",
  "Not -- not before this case. There was some - -",
  "-- later, as far as we know.",
  "For -- for Brady violations. They limit the principle to Brady violations.",
  "Well, that's a significant limitation, don't you think?",
  "Why wouldn't you start with that rule? The rule is perfectly lawful, my goodness.",
  "Wait. As I understand it, you -- you really have a need to train them, when you know defense counsel is coming over to look at the physical evidence, don't remove from the locker some of the physical evidence.",
  "You want to give a course in that?",
  "Well, then, you shouldn't have -- you shouldn't have mentioned it. I thought you were -- you were asserting that it was intentionally removed in order to prevent defense counsel from seeing it.",
  "You don't know that.",
  "But it isn't -- it isn't clear from what -- according to what you said earlier, it isn't clear that it was intentionally withheld from the defense. It might have just been -- you said it was sent to the lab when -- when he came to look for it.",
  "So would training have - - have gone into that detail? Don't send something to the lab when defense counsel is coming over to look for it. I mean, you know, that -- that's pretty detailed.",
  "Okay, but -- but that - -",
  "That's the lab report. That -- that's what Justice - -",
  "For all we know, by accident, right? And the training would -- would probably not have remedied that -- that difficulty.",
  "The defense was told to come over and look for it -- to look at it. And when he came over to look at it -- for all we know, by accident -- it was -- it had been sent to the lab.",
  "Yes, I understand, but - - yes. Okay.",
  "Are we just talking about a funeral? That's one of the problems I have with the case. There was also this video that -- that your client watched, right, later, after the funeral?",
  "Right. Well, what does that have to do with the funeral?",
  "That's fine, but it -- it does not intrude upon a funeral. I mean, no. You - - you either have two separate causes of action -- one is the intrusion upon the funeral, and the other is the harm caused by viewing this -- this posting on the Internet. But I don't see how they both relate to intrusion upon the funeral.",
  "And they were just submitted to the jury as one big lump, right?",
  "Suppose there hadn't been a funeral protest, just the epic. Would that have supported the cause of action you -- you assert here?",
  "Yes or no?",
  "Even though it's -- he doesn't have to watch them? They're just posted on the Internet.",
  "It's his choice to watch them, but if he chooses to watch them he has a cause of action because it causes him distress.",
  "Well, if that statute applies to any protest at funerals, protesting the Vietnam War, protesting whatever, your case involves, at least if we accept your version of it, a protest of the -- of a dead soldier who -- who is going to Hell and whose parents have raised him to go to Hell. So simply to say you can have a protest within a certain distance is not to say you can have a protest within a certain distance that -- that defames the corpse. That's - - that's a different issue, isn't it?",
  "So the intrusion upon the privacy of the funeral is out of the case then, right, because that sign would intrude upon the privacy of the funeral just as much? That's not really what you're complaining about. You're complaining about the personal attacks, aren't you?",
  "I thought that they had to turn in a different entrance? Is that -- is that the extent of the disruption?",
  "In order to avoid the protest?",
  "But you wouldn't have objected to that if there weren't these nasty signs, you just said, right?",
  "All right.",
  "Mr. Summers, I'm a little concerned at your apparent acceptance of -- of the proposition that if one comes up to a Marine and says, you're contributing to a -- a terribly unfair war, that that alone would -- would form the basis for the -- the tort of intentional infliction of an emotional distress. What -- what are the requirements for that? I thought that it had to be outrageous conduct. Doesn't it have to be outrageous conduct?",
  "Well, I mean -- I mean, why accept that as -- as parallel to what -- to what you're claiming here?",
  "Mr. Summers, can I -- can I ask this? Suppose -- suppose I don't think you have a cause of action for invasion of privacy when these people were at this distance from the funeral. But that was one of the causes of action submitted to the jury. If I disagree with you on that cause of action, I suppose I'd have to say there has to be a retrial now.",
  "So you have to support both causes of action here, the intentional infliction of emotional distress and the invasion of privacy, right?",
  "Waived -- waived what issue?",
  "Oh, all right. Okay.",
  "My goodness. We -- we did have a doctrine of fighting words, and you acknowledge that if somebody said, you know, things such as that to his face, that wouldn't be protected by the First Amendment.",
  "Unprotected.",
  "Is -- is that so? Do we know that?",
  "Do we know that? Is it the criterion of the fighting words exception to the First Amendment that there be an actual fight? Certainly not that. Is -- is it a requirement that there be a potential for a fight? I doubt it.",
  "Where -- where do you get the notion that it has -- that there has to be an imminent fight?",
  "Which say what?",
  "The person was too remote? The fight was not -- was not imminent?",
  "And she's a Quaker, too.",
  "Do you think that everybody - -",
  "Excuse me - -",
  "Let's talk about subjectively. You're concerned about -- surely fighting words is -- you know, whether something is a fighting word, that's a very subjective call, isn't it?",
  "You don't think it's subjective?",
  "You think that's solid, absolutely, what's a fighting word; whereas, what is an outrageous statement is -- is very much different from what's a fighting word? I don't see the difference. Besides which, isn't it the case that in order to recover for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional injury, you have to substantiate the injury with some physical manifestation, which the plaintiff here had? And, my goodness, for fighting words, you don't even need that. You can just say, these words angered me to the degree that I would have been inclined to fight. At least for this tort, you have to have physical manifestations. Why isn't that a very objective standard?",
  "So your point depends - -",
  "-- depends upon the proposition that what is outrageous is more subjective than what is fighting words, right?",
  "I guess that that kind of a call is always necessary under -- under the tort that you're -- that you're relying upon. The conduct has to be outrageous, right?",
  "That always requires that kind of a call, unless the tort is unconstitutional, as applied to all -- all harm inflicted by words.",
  "But you haven't really answered Justice Alito's question as to why the later language is not surplus. If indeed it bears the technical meaning you say that it -- that it bears, that later language is surplus.",
  "Say that again. I don't follow it. Tell me that again.",
  "Right.",
  "Mr. Frederick, I have this problem with -- with your interpretation. As -- as has been said, the government interprets \"unavoidable\" to mean unavoidable with respect to the vaccine that has been approved. If it doesn't mean that, if it simply means unavoidable with some other vaccine, you could always avoid them if you have a vaccine that is significantly less effective. I mean, what other vaccine are you comparing it with?",
  "I understand that, but the plaintiff comes in and says, Look, you could have eliminated this, this, and this, and these side effects would not occur. Of course the vaccine would only be effective in 75% of the cases, but nonetheless, it was avoidable.",
  "Well, that doesn't answer my question. I acknowledge it rests on current scientific knowledge, but current scientific knowledge would enable you to design a drug that does not have these side effects even though it's significantly less effective, and there is no criterion as to how much less effective it has to be to qualify and so forth, whereas the government's interpretation of the word ties it to a -- to a particular vaccine.",
  "It has to be just as effective?",
  "Just as effective?",
  "Now, that can't be a Ninth Circuit rule. I mean, that has to depend upon each -­ each of the States in the Ninth Circuit, no? I mean, some State could -- could have a different rule, I assume. You're -- you're telling us, however, that California has that rule?",
  "Do -- does the court sometimes deny explicitly on procedural grounds?",
  "So you're saying that if it's on both grounds, if they agree with both the procedural and the merits ground, they may well just -­ just deny without any explanation? But if they deny only on the procedural ground, they will -- they will say it?",
  "All right.",
  "I thought you just told me that if they -- if they agreed both with the procedural ground and the merits ground, they could issue just -­ just a denial without explanation.",
  "Now you're telling me that -- the opposite.",
  "That will always be in the order.",
  "Why -- do you think it makes a difference whether the expert would have -­ would have helped or not? I mean, counsel has to make that decision of whether to call an expert ex ante, not ex post. I mean, you -- we shouldn't evaluate his decision on the basis of whether, even if it's a 1,000-to-1 long shot, it turns out that that testimony would have been very successful. Don't we have to examine it ex ante before he knows what the result will be?",
  "Well, Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical would include the situation where he doesn't know that the prosecution is going to introduce any expert testimony. He knows that there is blood there. He should -- he should get his own expert, whether or not the prosecution uses one. Right? I mean, can it never be ineffective assistance not to call an expert where -- so long as the prosecution doesn't have one on the other side?",
  "Well, could? Really? Is that your test? It could -- there's some remote possibility?",
  "Why wouldn't he wipe up the blood? I mean, what -- what good is it to simply put him on the couch when you leave a pool of blood showing that that's where he was shot?",
  "Can I come back to your response to the Chief Justice's question about counsel who knows that his client is guilty, and you say the ABA standards say that even when that's the case, you have an obligation to get an expert witness to confirm that the client is -­",
  "Right.",

  "Yes, but you're -- you're positing that the only time they do not say either procedurally barred or on the merits is when they don't have a majority for either one?",
  "How can they render a decision in favor of the State, then, if there's no majority for either disposition?",
  "Excuse me. You've lost me. I thought you said -- I thought you said that they raised it in the brief in opposition to the petition for cert?",
  "Until the merits brief in opposition?",
  "Yes, but Judge Reinhardt and the court of appeals did not in fact apply the test of Hill, which you are asserting. The test is whether he would have gone to trial. I -- I didn't read the opinion as ever saying that he would have gone to trial. The opinion says he could have gotten a better deal. That's quite a different -- quite a different question, and I -- I'm not prepared to make that the test.",
  "But it's not the test that -- that Hill prescribed.",
  "Mr. Wax, as far as the confession is concerned and its excludability, what effect do you think we ought to give to this passage in the -- in the defendant's agreement to the plea: \"I understand that any admissions, statements, or confessions which I may have made or any evidence obtained by virtue of the search and seizure of my property may well be inadmissible against me in evidence, unless my constitutional rights have been safeguarded. I understand that if I would like to speak to an attorney concerning my constitutional rights, that the Court will grant me time for that purpose.\"",
  "Well, wait. Wait. This is not the attorney speaking. I mean, this is what he said. He said, \"I understand that any admissions, statements or confessions which I have made may well be\" -- \"may well be inadmissible against me in evidence.\"",
  "Well, boilerplate -- I mean, the man signed it. How can a prosecutor ever protect himself against the person who signs a plea agreement later -- later coming in and saying: Oh, my attorney misadvised me. I don't care what your attorney advised you. The plea agreement itself advises you that this stuff may be inadmissible.",
  "Well -­",
  "That's -- that's the problem. I mean, you can talk about a grievance procedure. I suppose there's always one in -- in companies that -- that are unionized, but an awful lot of companies aren't. Your -- the -- the Respondent is -- is going to argue that this statute doesn't apply to private filings of complaints anyway, that it relates only to the filing of a complaint with the government. And that -- that's a new -- a new point in this case, and normally I would not be disposed to consider it. My problem is, I cannot decide on -- on the question of whether filing means filing only in writing or also includes verbal filing, without resolving that other question. That is to say, if indeed the complaint has to be quote, \"filed\" with the government, I'm inclined to think that an oral complaint pursuant to procedures established by the agency which permit an oral complaint, even a complaint by telephone that would be okay. But my goodness, if it applies to private employers as well including employers that have no grievance procedures, including employers who have employees who go to cocktail parties, I am -- I am very disinclined to think that it -- that it could mean an oral complaint in -- in that context.",
  "So you are filing your argument right now. Now come on, people don't talk like that.",
  "That -- that -- that is absurd. You are not filing an argument right now. Nobody uses the language that way.",
  "I'm not sure that's true. You -- you can complain orally to somebody at the Labor Department who decides that the complaint isn't serious enough to -- to warrant commencing a proceeding. I mean, if you go in and insist, I -- you know, I want to begin a proceeding, that's -- that's something else. But you can file a complaint orally without -- without doing that, it seems to me.",
  "Not if it's never instituted. Not if it's never instituted. If no proceeding is ever instituted, you can hardly be accused of having caused a proceeding to be instituted.",
  "So if you make an informal complaint and it doesn't go any further, and they ask -­ \"You know, do you want to\" -- \"No, I don't want to start a proceeding, but -- but this company is just, you know, it's acting improperly, you guys ought to look into that.\" That's -- I'm 00 I'm prepared to say that's filing a complaint, if you are only talking about filing complaint with the government. But if you are talking about oral filings of the complaints with employer, I am very troubled.",
  "This is one of the oldest, though, isn't it.",
  "Is it the very oldest? It may well be the very oldest. You are talking about a really old fogey Congress that -- that passed this thing.",
  "What -- what is the language in those statutes? All those statutes use the language \"file a complaint\"?",
  "Wouldn't any retaliatory action be willful? I mean, to say it's in retaliation means you are firing this person because of the complaint.",
  "Your case would be a lot easier if you didn't try to have it both ways, to say, number one, it only applies to filing a complaint with the Government. And number two, you say, it also only applies to written complaints to the Government. I mean, why don't you -­",
  "Why don't you give a break to the illiterate and let them file oral complaints with the Government?",

  "Excuse me. I don't understand how those agencies have any part in the administration of private lawsuits under this statute.",
  "It administers lawsuits?",
  "I mean, it seems to me it's a matter for the courts. An agency interprets the statutes that direct the agency's own actions if it has to enforce things and so forth. But where there is a provision for a suit in court, it seems to me it's up to the courts to decide what it means.",
  "What do you mean by the very same language? Just -­",

  "Be a member of a committee? He is relying on large part on the context of filing a complaint. Does this statute have those other provisions?",
  "That's a big difference.",

  "Well, \"as construed\" -- I mean, it's their statute. I mean, you say somewhere in your brief that -- that they gave it an arbitrary and capricious interpretation. It's up to them how they want to interpret it. We don't -- we don't reinterpret State statutes because the State Supreme Court interpreted it strangely. It seems to me you're either challenging the statute or -- or you don't belong here.",
  "Okay. Just so long as we're clear about that.",
  "Well, couldn't the habeas court say the conviction was invalid because of the failure to turn over this -- this DNA evidence, which was relevant to the defense and which was unconstitutionally denied? Why wouldn't that be a basis for setting aside the conviction?",
  "I'll tell you what the problem is. The problem is Rooker-Feldman. That's -­ that's why all of these things don't make much sense. I mean, it wouldn't happen because you had the opportunity to raise that in the State court, and now you're retrying what the -- what the State court did decide.",
  "But -- but that would be an obstacle to habeas.",
  "Because in habeas you'd be seeking to set aside -­",

  "That's why it's so unrealistic to analyze it that way, it seems to me.",
  "To -- to win a Brady claim in habeas, wouldn't you -- you have to show not just that the -- that it was withheld, but that it was, indeed, exculpatory and could have affected the outcome of the trial. No?",
  "But he doesn't have to make that showing here. I mean, that's -- that's what he says distinguishes this case from habeas. In habeas, you would have to show that, indeed, it would justify a different outcome in the trial, whereas here he says I don't have to show that; I just want the evidence.",
  "That's what he is going to do with it. But he doesn't -- he doesn't say that I need to show that in order to be entitled to -- to the relief I'm asking for, whereas he would have to say that in habeas.",
  "Maybe -- maybe we need -- I mean, we've never had a case like this, and it's conceivable to -- to me that we have to expand what we said in Heck and Preiser. I'm not sure, however, that what we ought to say is what you propose: That the test is whether it could be brought in habeas. You say it could be brought in habeas by claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, but you would lose that -- that habeas. You can bring anything in habeas. I mean, you can file a habeas petition. I assume you mean you could possibly win in habeas. You couldn't win in habeas with this claim because you couldn't show that it would have affected the outcome. Isn't that so?",
  "What about where its only purpose is to demonstrate -- is to be able to demonstrate the invalidity of a judgment?",

  "But that's not the point that you've made here. I mean -- and that isn't the point on which we granted certiorari.",
  "No, it doesn't. It doesn't have to know what it was. It assumes it to be what -­ what the plaintiff claims it was.",
  "At the summary judgments, you give the benefit of the doubt to the plaintiff.",

  "Why was that?",
  "The Johnson line isn't much of a map, is what the Chief Justice is suggesting. It's a mess. It's very hard to sort those things out. Why -- why should we double the difficulty by -- by bringing it in at the -- at the Rule 50 stage as well?",
  "Why? All you have to do -­ any lawyer going in knows he has to make the motion at the close of the evidence. What -- what's the big deal?",

  "-- even though evidence has nothing to do with it. No matter what the evidence is, this is simply a matter of law. No jury, no reasonable jury, could find for that party on that issue. I don't read this as being purely a -- you know, a provision governing whether there is -- there's enough evidence in an area where there is no absolute rule of law. I think it applies to the absolute rule of law as well.",
  "The point would be that, therefore, you don't have to sort out whether there -­ there is any factual content to this issue. You don't have to sort out what's a pure question of law and what is a mixed question of law and fact, which is always very difficult. What's the big deal? Make the motion.",
  "You've assumed -- you've assumed all the evidence in their favor at the summary judgment stage.",
  "So you really think that this is a realistic scenario where there's going to be even more evidence against them than -- I mean, you're assuming the evidence against them.

  "You could complete it to a denial of recovery?",
  "I don't think that's any comfort to the Indian tribe, do you?",
  "Your argument assumes that there is available in the district courts injunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure Act, and that is far from clear, even after Bowen, it's far from clear if you had any business being in the district court anyway. And so in a way we are resolving a very strange question, that is if as is not clear, you have a right to sue in the district courts for an injunction, can that suit proceed because of 1500 when there is a suit pending in the Court of Claims and that is sort of an abstract question.",
  "Isn't that unrealistic? You don't want an accounting for the sake of having an accounting so that you can put the accounting in your desk. Oh, look it, they stole $1,000,000,000 from us. You want to get the $1,000,000,000. If the suits are directed at the same object, and it is fanciful to think there is this separate suit for an accounting. The object of that suit is the same thing as the object of the suit in the Court of Claims.",
  "Were those accountings available before the Administrative Procedure Act was passed? Is the jurisdictional basis for that the waiver of sovereign immunity that allows you to demand an accounting from the United States? Is that just the APA?",
  "So you didn't have a right to that before the APA was passed?",
  "Either in the district court nor in the Court of Claims. So this is not an unthinkable situation, is it?",
  "It was thought about for a century, anyway.",
  "Well, why have -- you say Congress has specifically recognized it by statute. You're referring to the APA?",
  "But did not provide for a lawsuit against -- against the government.",
  "Well, excuse me, it didn't make it easier. You -- you had to bring them both in the court of claims, no? You didn't still have the option of -- of still bringing two different suits, did you?",
  "You had to go to the court of claims.",
  "No, but if they were just making it easier, they -- they would have said, you know, you can do either one.",
  "If you give it that narrow meaning, however, the government says you are contradicting what was the case with regard to the cotton suits. That, in fact, some of them were asking for funds from this -- money from this common fund, and others were seeking relief against the individuals who had taken the cotton or replanted the cotton. Those are different claims, as you define \"claim,\" anyway.",
  "That is different from the word \"claim.\" I mean, if you are hanging the whole thing on the word \"claim,\" you gave me a very plausible alternate definition of \"claim.\" But your case does not follow that. Your case hinges on duplicative relief, which is something quite different. I don't know any definition of \"claim\" that is synonymous with duplicative relief.",
  "They don't even know who has hunting leases and -­",

And in these other cases I think it was clear. I don't think it's clear with simply the word \"appropriate relief.\"",
  "Yeah, but -- but, I mean, that means either that the Federal Government -- that the State government is liable for damages just as municipalities are, or that municipalities are immune to suit for damages just as the States are. I mean, that -- you don't know which way that cuts, do you?",

What State official would you -- would you sue? It seems to me you couldn't sue the State legislature, so it would make sense to have an injunction against the State.",
  "The word \"appropriate\" -­ the word \"appropriate\" would -- would suggest that to me. If -- if I'm a State attorney general, and I -- I know that the rule is sovereign immunity and -- and especially with regard to raids on the State treasury, I think it would be at least plausible that I would -- I would read \"appropriate relief\" not to include monetary relief. And we have said -- the language from our cases -- Lane says a waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in the statutory text and will be strictly construed in terms of its scope in favor of the sovereign. That's -- that's a high test.",
  "And -- and although I might sit down and come out with a conclusion after intensive study that yes, maybe the best reading of this statute is that it allows money damages, I find it hard to say that it is unequivocally expressed in the statutory text.",
  "You -- you deny that it has to be unequivocal?",

And it was always understood that the freedom of speech did not include obscenity. It has never been understood that the freedom of speech did not include portrayals of violence. You're -- you're asking us to create a -- a whole new prohibition which the American people never -­ never ratified when they ratified the First Amendment. They knew there were -- you know, obscenity was -- was bad, but what's next after violence? Drinking? Smoking? Movies that show smoking can't be shown to children? Does -- will that affect them? Of course, I suppose it will. But is -- is that -- are -- are we to sit day by day to decide what else will be made an exception from the First Amendment? Why -- why is this particular exception okay, but the other ones that I just suggested are not okay?",

I don't think that it is, to them, a determination of proximate cause at all. As I understand their opinion, they say that the statute requires that the -- let me get the right language here -- that the discriminatory -- prohibited discriminatory factor must have been a motivating factor in the employer's action. And they say that means it must have motivated the person who took the employer's action. It's not a motivating factor in the employer's action unless the person who took the action on behalf of the employer had that as its motive. Then the court of appeals makes an exception: However, if the person who appears to be taking the action on behalf of the employer is really not the person who took the action, but was totally under the control of a subordinate who -- and the person just swallowed that subordinate's determination, then we will hold, even though the ultimate firing -- the person who signed the pink slip, even though that person didn't have the motive, if in fact the decision was effectively the decision of a lower subordinate, we will hold the employer. It has nothing to do with proximate cause. It has to do with the text that it has to be a motivating factor in the employer's action; not a motivating factor somewhere down the line, but in the employer's action. That's how I read the court of appeals' opinion.",
  "That's -- that's not the point. It seems to me you have to -- we're not going to second-guess the jury determination here. I understood your point to be that there's a difference between a motivating factor in the decision, which means the person who made the decision on behalf of the employer must have had that motive and, on the other hand, a factor which was relevant to the decision, or a factor which influenced the decision. That's quite different from a motivating factor in the decision. You -- you have to get us to believe -- and I'm not sure we will -- that \"motivating factor in the decision\" refers to motive on the part of the person who made the decision.

Now, that decision, of whether to give the money to an STO or not, whether to give it to a religiously affiliated STO or a nonaffiliated one, that is in the hands of a private individual, just as the voucher program was.",
  "There -- there's no religious discrimination in that choice.",
  "Perhaps not, but you have -­",
  "You have an intervening parent or contributor. And it's that person who is making the decision of whether to give it to a religious or nonreligious organization; it isn't the government making that decision.",
  "And that was the same thing in Zelman.",
  "Oh, but that -- that doesn't -- that doesn't get you there. That doesn't get you there, as Justice Breyer's interrogation indicated.",
  "The same thing is true of charitable deductions. When you take a charitable deduction, you -- you don't have the money anymore. You have given it to a charitable organization. Now, you are allowed to give it to a particular religion, a particular church, and there seems to be nothing unconstitutional about that, right?",
  "So what -- what is unconstitutional here about the private -- the private decision to -- to give a benefit to a -- an organization that only supports particular schools and, indeed, only supports people of a particular religion to go to that school? I don't see any difference.",
  "But churches discriminate on the basis of religion. When I take my charitable deduction to give it to a particular church, that church discriminates on the basis of religion, but that's okay; isn't it?",
  "So it's how the government puts it, the idea? So it really is just that line in -­ in the tax form that you are concerned about, and the only relief you really need is -- is changing the tax form?",
  "I thought you said the opposite earlier. I thought you said the opposite earlier.",
  "I'm sure you did.",
  "That's the other issue. We are trying to separate in your argument the issue that some of these organizations are religiously affiliated, from the argument that, moreover, they will only give money to individuals of a particular religion. Now, I understand your argument for the latter, but I must say I don't understand your argument for the former. Not if you accept these other -­",
  "Where do you get that in the text? I mean, that's lovely, and you're saying that what Justice Breyer suggests makes perfect sense except for dictum and legislative history. Does your position make any sense with regard to text?",
  "Where? Where is that limitation in the text?",
  "I'm talking about your -­",
  "-- your limitation on exclusive rights abroad versus nonexclusive rights abroad. Where can you possibly find that in the text?",
  "Oh. Well, that's the end of it for me.",
  "You don't really mean -­ your position is that \"lawfully made under this title\" means that -- means \"would have been lawfully made under this title if this title governed.\" Isn't that basically what you are saying?",
  "Okay. But there is another provision of the statute -- I forget where it is -­ which says that in so many words.",
  "\"If this title had been applicable,\" right? We say \"applicable.\" Much prettier.",
  "And nothing in the text that supports your position.",
  "You pulled out of the sky this distinction between having created exclusive rights abroad and having created nonexclusive rights abroad. Where does that come from?",
  "You use -­",
  "I don't know why using -­",
  "Did the legislative history suggest what part of the text this -- this novel suggestion was based upon?",
  "Let me write that down.",
  "It seems to me -- why didn't they say -- instead of \"lawfully made under this title,\" why didn't they just say \"made in the United States\"?",
  "I mean, that's what you say it means. \"Made under this title\" means \"made in the United States.\"",
  "That's just not in the text. I mean, like the other side, in order to make your theory of the text appear reasonable, you have to bring in a skyhook with a limitation that finds no basis in the text.",
  "But you don't say that. I mean, you bring in this other qualification.",
  "But it would be lawfully made under this title, even though it was made -- you know, made abroad, if what?",
  "Is isn't the making that is rendered lawful. It's the importation into the United States that is rendered lawful by the agreement that you are relying upon.",
  "We don't know whether that's a step forward or backward.",
  "Yes, but, look, you say that, even on the basis of the facts before the California court, your client deserved relief. That may well be, but that's not what the -- what the Ninth Circuit said. The Ninth Circuit said that your client deserved relief in light of the facts before the California court plus other facts. Now, I'm not going to go back and answer a hypothetical question of whether, if the Ninth Circuit said on the basis of those facts alone that were before the California court, if -- if the Ninth Circuit had said that, would that opinion be affirmed? That's not the opinion they came up with. They added facts. So it seems to me that you have to live with what they wrote. And the basis of their decision included additional facts.",
  "That's your very point, isn't it?",
  "Page 35. I've spent all that time.",
  "Mr. Kennedy, can I bring you back to page 35? The -- the court of appeals' opinion, Ninth Circuit's opinion, says, \"Accordingly, if 2254(e)(2) were to limit the scope of the evidence before us, it would exclude only the new mental impairment theories\" -- the new mental impairment theories -- \"introduced in federal court, and their exclusion would not affect our result.\" The State contends that there -- there was other factual material, not just those theories but also the 6-and-a-half-hour time sheet evidence.",
  "So at least, you know, that really doesn't cover the waterfront of -- of all new evidence.",
  "To say that they were on record in the State court is not to say that they were part of the record, of the trial record. And these things were not part of the trial record, right?",
  "All -- all that goes -­ goes to the fact-finder?",
  "All that goes to a jury in criminal cases?",
  "Yes, but that -- that was on the assumption that the only new evidence would have been the evidence of -- how did they put it? \"The new mental impairment theories introduced in federal court.\" That that's the only new evidence that would be -- would be excluded. And the other side contradicts that.",
  "I wouldn't believe that. I mean, you had nothing to support it. I mean, I'd say that's just lawyer's puffery -­",
  "-- whereas you come up with a record that shows 6.5 hours. I mean, that's something.",
  "Is that where the 6 and a half hours came from?",
  "His records -­",
  "Which the California court had.",
  "So it's not new evidence, then. It wasn't new evidence before the Federal court.",
  "If you're relying on allegations rather than the evidence, the allegation was even worse. The allegation was zip.",
  "No time.",
  "Well, exactly, that doesn't help you.",
  "What if -- what if a State finds it unconscionable to have an arbitration clause in an adhesion contract which requires the arbitration to be held at a great distance from -- from where the other party is and requires that party to pay the cost of the arbitration? Can a State not find that to be unconscionable?",
  "Well, that wouldn't apply to other -- to other contracts.",
  "Are we going to sit in judgment? Are we going to sit in judgment? I know you say -- you say it has to shock the conscience, but if a State wants to apply a lesser standard of unconscionability, can we strike that down?",
  "So how do you address Justice Scalia's -- if you are saying there is no difference between those two things, then how can a State find those terms unconscionable? Under what theory, general theory of law, would they be -­",
  "That is bad, absolutely, but that's not what the State is going to do. The State is simply going to say: We find this to be unconscionable. And you say it's not unconscionable; it's very fair. And the State says: Eh, we think it is unconscionable. Are we going to tell the State of California what it has to consider unconscionable?",
  "Yes, but some -- some elements of unconscionability can only arise in a litigation or an arbitration context, such as requiring the complaining party to litigate or arbitrate at a distant location. How could that possibly apply in -­ to any other contracts?",
  "Yes.",
  "Three? What are the three?",
  "I was going to ask you about that. Right.",
  "So how do you have special rules applicable to banks?",
  "Contracts by banks, can't a State say, you know, certain bank contracts have to have this or that?",
  "They claim that here. They claim it's the general principle of unconscionability.",
  "Of course. The question is not whether they are being forced to accept class arbitration; it's whether they are being coerced into abandoning regular arbitration. That's really the issue.",
  "That's true, as long as those impediments are removed on an -- on an equal footing with all contracts.",
  "Yes, but I -- I find it difficult to regard as -- voiding exculpatory contracts. I mean, yes, contracts which say I'm not liable if -­ even though I've committed a wrong, that's exculpatory. But the State here says, you have to not only be liable for any faults that the other party to this contract discovers, but the other party of this contract has to be able to benefit from whatever faults anybody else in the world might find and bring -- and bring a class action lawsuit. I -- that -- that goes well beyond forbidding any exculpatory provisions.",
  "Mr. Phillips, this is what troubles me about -- about your position: You make a viscerally appealing case on the facts of this case, where you say that your clients, the railroads, are being taxed more than competing carriers, truckers and -- and water carriers. But if all -- if all it says is \"discriminates,\" and you think that that has to be applied without qualification, then even if -- if a state makes an exemption for, you know, widows over 85 and doesn't make the same exemption for railroads, the railroads win, right?",
  "Why? How do you limit the term \"discrimination\"? Just a discrimination in favor of other competing carriers?",
  "Why -- why do you assume that? Congress didn't limit it to that in -- in the property tax exemption.",
  "But not -- not just the industrial and -- and commercial competitors with the railroads. The railroads were to be given, you know, the most favored treatment of -- of all the industrial and -- and commercial entities, I -- I think.",
  "So -- so 85-year-old widows would be covered? That would be discrimination because, you know, there are only resident 85-year-old widows who are covered, right?",
  "I agree with that, and that makes me suspect that Congress didn't -- didn't want to forbid exemptions in (b)(4).",
  "It doesn't make any -- any sense, you are quite right; but -- but Congress thought it made sense in (1) to (3), so why doesn't it make sense in (4)?",
  "That's the argument.",
  "Use a lot of conjunctions.",
  "I didn't understand your last answer. What was it?",
  "Yes, but I don't understand why you think it is -- it is more articulable on your theory than on theirs. I don't see where solving your predictability problem, you're worried about it, you know, we don't know how to tax anymore. I don't know why it's any more certain if we -- if we say the key is whether it's a generally applicable tax than it is if we say the key is whether it discriminates against railroads. I mean it's the same inquiry. So what do you care? It's just as -- just as unpredictable ex ante. It's exactly the same inquiry, whether it's generally applicable or whether it discriminates against railroads. Isn't -- isn't -- isn't that what you have been saying?",
  "So, it's twiddle dum or twiddle dee, maybe we should, you know, dismiss this as improvidently granted, it doesn't make any difference.",
  "But you don't know what \"generally applicable\" means.",
  "At least I don't know. How do you know?",
  "How are these any different from property taxes? I mean States could say the same thing about property taxes. Nonetheless it was felt necessary to specify that -- that exemptions don't count.",
  "Before deciding whether or not you are discriminating against the railroads.",
  "Mr. Phillips, do you agree that -- that, generally applicable produces the same -­ requires the same inquiry as discriminates?",
  "What separates a stereotype from a reality? Do you say it is not true that if there is a legitimate -- illegitimate child, it is much more likely that the woman will end up caring for it than that the father would?",
  "That's not true?",

  "Unless he's a United States citizen.",
  "A reversal of the judgment on the grounds that your client is a United States citizen, right?",
  "That he is, not that -­ that he is. That he is. Do you have any other case where a Court has conferred citizenship on someone who, under the statutes as written, does not have it?",
  "Never done.",
  "Unless -- unless we -- we solve the violation the other way, by saying that the father gets the shorter period that the -- than the mother has.",
  "I'm sorry, that the mother gets the longer period than the father has.",
  "You say we can't apply that retroactively. Well, okay; we don't apply it retroactively. The people that have citizenship cannot constitutionally be deprived of it, but for everybody else, it's okay.",
  "In Fiallo v. Bell.",
  "But why -- why would we grant that remedy when it doesn't do this Petitioner any good whatever. It's -- it's a remedy that doesn't remedy.",
  "We are -- we aren't granting relief that doesn't provide relief.",
  "Well, that would be in effect saying that we have no jurisdiction, because there is no standing. Because there -- there is no remediation that the Court can make.",
  "I don't -- I don't understand your argument at all. It seems to me the phrase \"post-conviction or other collateral review\" means postconviction collateral review or preconviction collateral review. Isn't that what is added? \"Post-conviction or other\"; what's \"other\" from \"post-conviction\"? I guess it would be preconviction, wouldn't it?",
  "That's fine. And is this direct review?",
  "So it's collateral review? So -­",
  "So you lose.",
  "I would think that if -- if there's anything to the point you're making, it -- it hinges not on the \"post-conviction or other collateral\" phrase, but rather on the word \"review.\" I suppose it could be argued that you're not reviewing the judgment if you're asking for mercy. Whether a judgment was good or bad, you're -- you're asking for mercy. And I would -- you know, perhaps it's not review. Is that your point?",
  "Well, that's only because all the cases we've had involved that. We've never had a case like this before. So in all those other cases, we've used the natural term \"collateral review.\" That doesn't mean it couldn't apply to this. It just means we've never had occasion to inquire whether it applies to this.",
  "Well, then -- then think you're saying that it only gets reversed for abuse of discretion, right?",
  "And that's a legal ground, it seems to me. And I don't know how you could say that that's a plea for leniency. It's a plea that -- that the sentencing court abused its discretion and should have given a lesser sentence. How is that leniency? It's abuse of discretion.",
  "I don't want to have to figure this out case by case, or even jurisdiction by jurisdiction, as to whether it's an abuse of discretion review or a leniency review or this or that. And that -- that makes me inclined to say we should treat your Rule 35 as coming within the tolling provision, so we don't have to grapple with -- I mean, I'm not having very much success understanding the distinction that you're telling me. I don't want to have to do this for 50 States.",
  "Either -- either your victory will give you absolutely nothing, or you have truly stupid defendant lawyers in Rhode Island. I mean, why would anybody not caption the 35 motion that way?",
  "What's to lose? You say it doesn't matter if your claim of an illegal sentence is frivolous or not. What's to lose?",
  "But you've said that this could be done before finality. I thought -- I -­",
  "I'm sure you said that earlier, that this motion can be made before the judgment is final. Didn't you say that?",
  "But that's not what you just said.",
  "What you just said is after the finality. Which is it?",
  "Except that it says -­",
  "I guess we need a new adjective then, because I'd always thought that there are two kinds of review, direct and collateral. You say there's a -- a tertium quid. What do you want us to call that?",
  "I think that maybe it doesn't need to be called anything because it doesn't exist. I -- I can't -­",
  "-- imagine anything that isn't either direct or collateral.",
  "Do we have any indication in the case law what a reasonable time consists of?",
  "Well, that may be right, but I don't think that's the reason. I -- I thought we had held that the word \"filed\" in the petition means filed in a court, not filed with the governor. It's -­ it's the word \"filed\" in -- in the tolling provision that -- that does the work.",
  "So if this was -- if this motion had been filed before judgment, which can happen, before the judgment is final, then there would be no tolling?",
  "So the question -­",
  "So the answer is yes. This motion which can be filed either before or after judgment -- the time is tolled if it's made after the judgment but not if it's made before.",
  "Well -- well, that's not -­ that's not what the State says, anyway. The State says, and I think the way 35 reads, it doesn't have to be filed after judgment.",
  "That's right. It can't be filed any later than that. But it doesn't say that it can't be filed before judgment.",
  "That's right.",
  "When does -- when does it become final? When does the -- even at the trial court level, when does it become final?",
  "Is there some Federal rule that says you have to apply a procedural ground before you decide the merits?",
  "So it's up to California which of the two it wants to use.",
  "Yes, and what -- isn't that a separate rule? I mean, no matter how soon, if he does it a week after, doesn't California have a rule that you can't come back with another habeas with material that you could have produced in the -- in the former habeas?",
  "So time -- time has nothing to do with that. It's just a separate -- a separate bar.",
  "You think 5 years is too long, though?",
  "Yes.",
  "Wait. No. Why do you concede that it would be bad? Can't the State, if it wishes, give grace to people who did apply late, but because the case is so meritorious or for any other reason? The issue is whether those people who filed 5 years later and knew that it was very late, whether they're entitled to have their cases heard, not whether the -- the State allows somebody who filed 6 years earlier to have it heard. How does that do any injustice to the person who knew that 5 years was, you know, you're likely to be denied?",
  "I don't see why the State has to be consistent in it. If -- as a matter of grace, it can -- it can allow some people, so long as the people who are denied had every reason to believe that they were coming in too late, and 5 years is coming in too late.",
  "But -- but the cases that you're using in which we insisted upon adequacy in the sense of equal treatment of equal people are cases in which the effect of the State decision was to exclude the matter from Federal -- from Federal supervision. The matter could not come before the Federal courts.",
  "This is something quite different. This is applying a time limit. I don't see why we have to apply the same rule and -- and look into the -- whether it's not discretionary. I mean, to say it's discretionary always means that sometimes similar cases may be treated differently.",
  "So I don't know why you -­ you concede that -- that we take an adequacy rule that's used for one purpose and should apply it to a totally different situation.",
  "But none of this is -- is a device as is used in the cases that -- that you are referring to that go into adequacy, a device to exclude the Federal courts from the case. That's -- that's not what's going on here, is it?",
  "But that's not a question of adequacy, is it? It's a question of notice.",
  "These cases that you cite, before you go any further -- are they cases in which the California Supreme Court came out with an opinion saying that 6 years was okay? Or are they just cases where, without an opinion, the California Supreme Court went to the merits?",
  "What -- what do you mean they were decisions, written opinions or just went to the merits and decided the merits? Did they say anything about the delay question?",
  "But the other side says that, unless there is an opinion, the reason they may have gone to the merits is it was just a lot easier.",
  "They didn't have to worry about it.",
  "Let's assume that -- that California had just adopted this -- this rule that habeas petitions have to be filed as promptly as circumstances permit. They've just brand-new adopted it, and you're the lawyer for somebody who says, you know, I think I'm going to wait 5 years. Don't you think that even if there were no California law on the subject, you would know that his habeas claim is going to be denied?",
  "Do you really need case law to tell you that 5 years is not as promptly as circumstances permit when you -- when you have no justification?",
  "Oh, so you can't have a first case?",
  "Oh, okay.",
  "You think reasonable men differ about 5 years?",
  "You may be -- you'd better be careful about what you wish for because I am not sure that the kind of system that's being proposed is going to be better for habeas applicants than the one that California now has. We really don't know that, do we?",
  "But don't be rhetorical.",
  "They didn't take any evidence on the point, I thought.",
  "Current conditions?",
  "What was -- what was your friend talking about when he said that they rejected any effort to show the current situation?",
  "This was in 2008.",
  "And when was the remedy imposed?",
  "That was in the -- in the one-judge court, in the district court, wasn't it?",
  "Well, what do you mean they can do it?",
  "Of course, they could do it safely if they built, you know, umpteen new prisons, but that -­",
  "But that's -- you know, that's pie in the sky. That's not going to happen.",
  "What -- doesn't good time credits let -- let people out who would not otherwise be out?",
  "But -­",
  "Am -- are we missing something? They -- they cannot be in the SPD unless they are in the plan; isn't that right?",
  "So -- so the one cannot be more detailed than the other, can it?",
  "Right. But what -­",
  "Whatever is in the SPD must be in the plan; isn't that right?",
  "Yes. That's what I'm talking about, of course.",
  "It can't be part of the plan without modifying the plan, can it?",
  "Because it contradicts other provisions.",
  "Likely harm to whom? I think that's the question -­",
  "-- that Justice Kennedy is asking, and I have the same question. Does it mean likely -- is it likely that the class as a whole has been harmed, or that each -- is it likely that each individual member of the class has been harmed?",
  "Or a majority? Or whatever?",
  "What does \"likely harm\" mean? Do we know that?",
  "What is that provision?",
  "Does it appear anywhere in -- in the briefs? 1024(h), does it appear anywhere in the briefs?",
  "Why not?",
  "But the likely harm -­",
  "That's not the likely harm. That's the breach. That's the offense.",
  "You're saying once you make the offense, you have to cough up what you stated in the -- in the summary.",
  "Well, then it's not contract.",
  "Is it contract or not contract?",
  "Is this governed by ERISA or are these things governed by ERISA?",
  "But we have a statute here which says that it is the plan that governs. I mean, that -- that's -- don't you think that's a crucial difference?",
  "Do they use a likely harm standard? Is that where the likely harm standard comes from?",
  "That's nice. Where did they get it from?",
  "They just made it up?",
  "So it can't -- it can't amend the plan, contrary to what we've said.",
  "It's not an amendment?",
  "Well, wait -- wait. It's part of the plan, but the other part of the plan contradicts this part of it. And -- and you say it is this part, the SPD, that governs, which means it amends the prior part, right?",
  "Oh, all right, okay. We'll say it controls. Does that make you feel better about it?",
  "Why didn't that (h) apply here? Was it not egregious enough? Is that -- is that why it didn't apply? Or they just forgot about it or what?",
  "Why doesn't it apply to the SPD? Isn't that a notice?",
  "I thought it says -­",
  "Well, you had a different Congress. I mean, the Congress that passed the law is not necessarily the same Congress that -- that failed to amend the law. Are we to consider laws to be in effect only for so long as the Congress that passed them is sitting, and then the failure to make any changes in light of judicial decisions by later Congresses effectively amends the law?",
  "That's an extraordinary proposition.",
  "Mr. Mann, do you assume that there's always a reason for Congress's not passing a law? I mean, it's hard enough to figure out their reason for passing a law -­",
  "-- but there could be an infinitude of reasons why a law is not passed.",
  "Do you know of any case in which the failure of Congress to amend a law in order to overrule a court decision other than a decision of this Court has been held to be an implicit approval of that decision? Do we have a single case where we've said, oh, there was a line of court of appeals cases, and since Congress failed to amend the statute to take account of those court of appeals cases, Congress must have approved them. Do we have any case like that?",
  "I don't know of any.",
  "Mr. Mann, I thought you disagreed with the premise of Justice Ginsburg's question; that is, that you assert that the language related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency is quite clear.",
  "I thought maybe you were abandoning that.",
  "All the rules of an agency would -- would be sucked in, wouldn't it?",
  "I mean, all the rules the agency promulgates are supposed to be enforced by the personnel of the agency.",
  "They become personnel rules and practices.",
  "I suppose the Office of Personnel Management has a pretty broad charter, then, on your theory of what the adjective means. OPM must be a very powerful agency.",
  "Well, let's assume -- and -- and I'm not sure what the situation is in -- in the Commonwealth. We have held that the States don't have to have the same notion of separation of powers that the Federal Government does. In the Federal Government, we allow independent regulatory agencies separate from the President. Let's assume that Virginia has a system in which the governor is indeed in charge of the entire -­ the entire executive branch. Do you know whether that's the case? I don't know.",
  "Okay. Well, if it were and if Congress offered money to the State and the only way the State could get it would be to abandon its system of separation of powers and to allow an agency of the State which would normally be under the direction of the governor to go riding off on its own and -- and sue the governor, do you think there wouldn't be any -- any problem about -- about the Federal Government doing that?",
  "Requiring the State to in effect alter its -- its governmental structure in order to obtain the Federal money?",
  "Sure.",
  "Got you.",
  "I guess, in Nixon v. United States, the President could have dismissed the attorney general, but we allowed the suit to go forward. I never did understand that.",
  "Yes, I -­",
  "That can't be. How can that be? He has no power as attorney general to do that. It has nothing to do with -- with Ex parte Young. It has to do with his power as attorney general.",
  "But your -- your answer -­",
  "I really lost you. I thought Ex parte Young applied to defendants.",
  "I didn't think Ex parte Young allows -- allows an attorney general to sue -- to sue as a plaintiff in his personal capacity. Am I wrong about that?",
  "A dignified sovereign should not agree to the deal.",
  "I mean, you know, the Commonwealth had the choice. It had two choices, as -­ as counsel for the Government said. It could either turn down the money or, if it's not dignified enough to do that, it could take the money and establish a private organization to do this work instead of a State agency. So, what -- you know, what complaint do you have here?",
  "Why -- why is it an extension? I mean, I have sort of a bit of a problem with that. Why is it somehow a -- a greater infringement upon State sovereignty to allow a State to be sued in Federal court by a private individual, who doesn't even have to be a Virginian, for Pete's sake -­ he could be from anywhere, he could be from Iowa. And yet, it somehow offends State sovereignty more when -­ when you allow a State agency to sue a State? I don't -- I don't see why that's so horribly worse, unless you're arguing that -- that it somehow destroys the State system of separation of powers. But that's a different question, and -- and the answer to that is simply you did it yourself.",
  "And -- and that has independent litigating authority.",
  "Okay. I mean, that's the difference here.",
  "This agency was given independent litigating authority.",
  "So your argument is really -- really is a sovereign immunity argument. You're saying that the waiver of sovereign immunity, unless it explicitly includes a waiver to be sued in Federal courts, applies only in State courts -- okay -- and that that limitation should not be evaded by applying Ex parte Young to a suit in Federal court where the suit is by another State agency.",
  "So sovereign immunity is part of your argument, but -­",
  "So you -- you would acknowledge that if a State knew when it took the money that it was -- and when it created a State agency to administer the program, that it was letting itself open to suit in Federal court under an Ex parte Young theory, then everything would be okay?",
  "Well, that would be a waiver of -­",
  "-- whatever sovereignty immunity interest it had, wouldn't it?",
  "Well, Congress could, but if they knew it in this instance when they accepted the money, you wouldn't have a case, would you?",
  "That's a good point.",
  "Gee, I thought Bowles was a nice, clear case. I mean, you can always find some distinction in the next case, and I thought the object of Bowles was to say if it's a -- if it's a limit on appeal, it's jurisdictional.

  "Well, that may mean that they're duped, but it doesn't mean that they don't have control. They had control, but you say they -- they were duped. But that's quite a different theory from saying that they had control -­",

  "Why -- why is that a problem if, as -- as the Federal statute requires and the State statutes require, you have to show an intent to hire an unauthorized worker? Isn't -- isn't that what the State statutes here require?",
  "Right.",

  "Well, I think what Arizona would answer to that is: Well, that's the only option the Federal Government left us.",
  "They excluded everything else. We might have used reticulated penalties or, you know, enforced the Federal law ourselves, but they forbade that. But they did allow us to enforce the law, immigration laws, through licensing, right? So it all essentially comes down to -- to the licensing issue, doesn't it?",
  "That would be possible only because nobody would think that, with this scheme in place, the Federal Government would not enforce it. Of course, no one would have expected that. But what Arizona says has occurred here is that the scheme in place has not been enforced, and Arizona and other States are in serious trouble financially and for other reasons because of -- of unrestrained immigration. And, therefore, they had to take this very massive -- I agree this step is massive, and one wouldn't have expected it to occur under this statute, but expectations change when the Federal Government has -- has simply not enforced the immigration restrictions.",
  "It could have named that, if that's all it meant.",
  "It could have named that, that particular licensing scheme, if that's what it meant. But it didn't name it; it said licensing generally. What did it intend to add to that? Barbers' licenses?",

Now, I have -- maybe you'll persuade me otherwise, but I have no doubt that insofar as this law limits the authority to do business within the State, it is a -- it is a licensing law. It's a little harder extending licensing to formation of a corporation, but when you issue a corporation charter you really do two things. You create the corporation and enable the limitation of liability that creates, and secondly, you authorize that new creature to do business within your State. So at least half of that corporation law is licensing, it seems to me. Now, if that's what I think, what -­",

  "Are Federal laws not to be applied uniformly.",
  "I don't see the problem in -- in diverse adjudication. Wouldn't there be a Federal question presented if a -- if a company claimed that it was deprived of the ability to do business because of a mistaken interpretation of Federal law, that the person it hired was not an authorized person?",
  "Wouldn't that be a Federal question that -- that could be -­",
  "Doesn't the State law basis refer to the Federal law?",
  "I thought it tracked it.",
  "Excuse me. You -- are you saying, and I think the Petitioner here may have been saying as well, that if you have a licensing law that permits the revocation of the license, the revocation is not a licensing law?",
  "Suppose I have a licensing law which says if you do this, your license will be revoked. Does that remain a licensing law?",
  "Why make exception for licensing laws therefore if you can't revoke a license under it?",
  "Once you're in, you can do whatever you like. Do you think that is what Congress meant? You can -- you can pass upon their fitness when you issue the license, but once its issued, they can do whatever they like; is that right?",
  "And revocation. Okay. So that raises the question: What does it make -- why does it make any difference if the revocation provision is contained in the narrow licensing law or if there's a general State law which says all licenses that -- that are issued may be revoked for certain reasons?",
  "So they should just -- Arizona should just amend all its licensing laws to require what they now require when the license is issued, and to say, in each specific licensing law, that it can be revoked for the same -- on the same grounds -­",
  "That would solve the problem.",
  "Would you -­",
  "-- read that section again?",
  "No, no, that's all right.",
  "Perhaps Congress never expected that the States would have to resort to such massive measures, and they probably wouldn't have if -­ if the law had been uniformly enforced and vigorously enforced, right? You -- you didn't -- didn't have any notion of doing this sort of thing in 1986, did you?",
  "So maybe Congress wasn't worried about it because it seemed very unlikely that anything like that would occur.",
  "Do -- do you make it mandatory?",
  "You just -- you just don't get the safe harbor. Isn't that the only consequence?",
  "Does this lawsuit challenge that?",
  "You're under the old law, and the only -- the only sanction is you lose the safe harbor, if that's a sanction.",
  "So you think after this case we could look forward to cases, one by one, for all the various types of licenses? Those would be as-applied challenges and would not have been resolved by this case.",
  "We're really wasting our time here, aren't we?",
  "So, are you -- are you conceding that any variation from the Federal standards for -- for criminal and civil liability is automatically precluded? I mean, as I read the exception, it's an exception for State licensing and similar laws. And it doesn't say \"so long as those licensing and similar laws go no further than what the Federal Government has done.\" I mean, we often allow States to impose regulatory requirements that go beyond the regulatory requirements that the Federal Government has imposed, and that is not automatically considered to be pre-empted. So why -- why are you conceding that Arizona cannot go a whit beyond what the Federal Government says?",
  "Convicted by -- by a Federal Government that hasn't gone after many convictions.",
  "That's the whole problem.",

  "Well, I think it's at least a horse race, and that brings us back to how much deference you give to the -- to the Board.",

  "Mr. Frederick, I'm -- I'm not clear on why you can draw a distinction between materiality and scienter for purposes of the issue before us here. If, indeed, satanic effect is enough for materiality, you say, well, it may not be enough for scienter. Why? I mean, if the company knows that satanic effect is material, then the company has -­ knowingly withholds it because it thinks satanic effect is irrational, why doesn't that company have scienter, if it's material? The scienter is withholding something that is material, that is known to be material, and once you say that -- you know, that Satan is material, if the company thinks Satan is involved here, it has to put it in its report, no?",

  "What about that?",
  "So the Government's position is that reports of adverse effects that have no scientific basis, so long as they would affect irrationally consumers, have to be disclosed, assuming the company has said we're doing well, right?",

  "You -- you say you get the same amount of water and it's up to -- it's up to Wyoming to figure out who they have to cut down for not putting back enough to meet that amount? You don't care what private owner it comes from? It's up to Wyoming to figure out who has to be cut back?",

  "Your people are entitled to take out the same amount they took out before, right? Pre-1950?",
  "Whereas the people in Wyoming, you say, are not entitled to take out the same amount; they are entitled only net the same amount that they had before. Whereas downstream your people can take out the same amount and whereas before 20 percent of it used to go back into the stream, they can now make use of that whole 20 percent through sprinkler irrigation, right? It gives you a great advantage. I mean, maybe that's the way it was written, but -- but don't tell me that this is even-handed, because it -­",
  "I would think your best point is not all of that stuff, but simply the definition section, which very clearly makes a distinction between beneficial use and diversion. And your point is that what is guaranteed is not the diversion right that existed pre-1950, but the beneficial use right, which is the net use of the water, not -- not the total amount diverted. If -- if there were not both of those definitions, it seems to me it would be a little -- your case would be a little harder. But with the two of those definitions there and with V(A) using beneficial use rather than -- it could have said diversion, appropriative right to diversion, but it didn't say that.

  "Where is that again -­ where at?",
  "But we're dealing here with a compact which has a text, and -- and what the water law of Wyoming or of Montana happened to be cannot overrule the text, and I am -- I'm hung up on the fact that article V(A) says appropriative rights to the beneficial uses of the water of the Yellowstone River System existing as of January 1, 1950. Appropriative rights not to diversion, not to diversion for beneficial uses, but appropriative rights to the beneficial uses, which is defined -- which is defined in the compact to say \"that use by which the water supply of a drainage basin is depleted when usefully employed.\" And it could have said diversion, but it didn't say that, and I notice that the Government's brief uses -- seems to use the words interchangeably, \"depletion\" and \"diversion.\" They're not interchangeable. They're defined quite separately in this thing. And besides which I find it implausible that Montana signed on to, well, we don't know how much water we're going to get; it depends, you know, upon how much stuff was -- was flowing back before, but we're not guaranteed that that will be flowing back again. You combine those two things, and I -- I -­ what do you do about that definition?",

  "No, but, I mean, to -- to do that, the definition would have read: The term \"beneficial use\" is defined to be that use by which the water -- that use \"for which\" the water supply of a drainage basin is diverted for useful employment by the activities of man, and that's not what it says. To the contrary, it makes a clear distinction between \"depletion\" and the previous definition of \"diversion.\" I just -- I was trying to give that stark difference some effect in the later section V(A).",

  "The United States would not? They surely targeted the United States.",
  "That's right. But if the national sovereign, the United States, provided by statute that Federal district courts would have jurisdiction over any -- any tort suit by a person injured by a foreign manufacturer that targeted the United States, would that be proper?",

  "And I -- I don't know how we could proceed by looking at, you know, whether in fact a majority of the cases that come into this first relatively harmless category did indeed involve situations that involved physical risk because, as everybody knows, prosecutors plea bargain, and it's probably very often the case that the defendant is charged only under -- under category 1, where, you know, if he went to trial, they'd charge him under 3; isn't that so?",
  "Yes, yes. You want to say \"yes.\"",
  "I presume that if -­",
  "And it may well be that in deciding whether to accept a plea bargain of being guilty of (A) rather than going to trial on (B), if your client has two violent felonies already on the book, you might take -- take the plea bargain under (A) lest you run afoul of the violent felony act.",
  "I don't understand your answer to that question. I would have thought that your answer, if you're insisting on a categorical approach, would be \"no,\" that there's nothing in -- in (3) that requires any violence at all. Just fleeing by visible or audible means, just -- just flees. That's all it says.",
  "That's a good question.",
  "I suppose that if we agreed with you that whether it is a violent crime depends upon what other prosecutions for fleeing could have been brought. If we agree with you that (1)(A) is negligible because there are other bigger ones for which he wasn't charged, we could leave open the question of what -­ what happens in a State that has only one crime for fleeing, and we would -- then we would have to confront the question that Justice Sotomayor has asked. But if we accept your notion that -- where you have a gradation that is adopted by the State, the lowest gradation cannot be determined to have a high percentage of bodily risk, right?",

  "Suppose you have a State that has a separate crime for trespassing, criminal trespass.

That doesn't seem -- that doesn't seem to me right.",
  "Just because prosecutors make that choice, that doesn't establish that the elements of the crime, which is what we focus on in deciding whether it's a violent felony, fill the bill.",

And -- and you want us to hold that failing to stop when a police officer tells you to stop is a violent felony. That -­ that seems to me a -- a big leap. I mean, words have some meaning, and Congress focused on violent felonies.",
  "What about speeding, just -- you know, you're going 15 miles over the speed limit?",

  "Not necessarily risky. Conduct that shows disrespect for the law.",

  "Yes, but without that noise. Just -­",
  "No, of course not.",
  "Why -- why not? I mean people -- you know, when there's a knock on -- on the door, is the normal human reaction to walk into the other room and shut the door?",
  "I mean, that's peculiar behavior, isn't it?",
  "Is that a common experience, that you knock on a door and all you hear is somebody walking out of the room and shutting a door?",
  "I don't recall it ever happening to me, but maybe -- maybe I'm a likable fellow and people open the door.",
  "They could say \"Go away.\" They could do a lot of stuff. But walk in the other room and shut the door?",
  "Strange.",
  "You don't know that they're destroying evidence unless you have reason to believe that there is contraband inside. I mean, the -- the hypothetical is an unrealistic one. They knock on the door, and somebody moves inside -- that doesn't give them any exigency -­",
  "Okay. They -­",
  "Well, that's a different hypothetical.",
  "There's a hypothetical in which they knock on every door under which they smell marijuana.",
  "Perfectly okay?",
  "The -- I'm sorry.",
  "Loudly. Is any of that unlawful? Is -- is knocking loudly on the door unlawful?",
  "Is it -- is it unlawful? Is -- is saying \"Open up, police\" -- is that unlawful?",
  "Ms. Drake, the problem I have is there are a lot of constraints on -- on law enforcement, and the one thing that -- that it has going for it is that criminals are stupid.",
  "And we had a case some years ago in which the issue was whether the Washington police could enter buses arriving from -- from the south and -- and randomly ask passengers, do you mind if we look in your luggage? And the -- the -- the mules who were carrying marijuana were stupid enough to say, oh, of course. Just to show that they had nothing to fear. And an enormous number of arrests were -- were effected in that fashion. We didn't say that's not fair because you're taking advantage of the -- of the ignorance of these -­ these poor criminals. We said that's perfectly okay. And it seems to me the same thing is going on here. These people could have answered the door -­ there's a policeman knocking on the door; all he's saying is \"Open the door, open the door\" -- and say \"Yes, what do you want?\" Say -- you know, blah, blah, blah. They say \"Well, get a warrant.\" Shut the door. They didn't do that. But everything done was perfectly lawful. It's unfair to the criminal? Is that -- is that the problem? I really don't understand the problem.",
  "But I -- you -- you might have considerable support on the Court for the proposition that if the exigent circumstance is created by unlawful activity by the police, which would include conveying the impression that they are about to kick the door in, then -- then you have a different case. But -­ but I thought the case we had before us is what if the police officers are behaving perfectly lawfully and they're not threatening to kick down the door, and they smelled the marijuana and then they hear the motion inside, does that justify their going in? And that's what I thought we took the case for, and that's a different question. You're trying to -- you're trying to make the police officers' actions unlawful, and I will stipulate that if their actions were unlawful you have a different case, and probably the evidence would have to be suppressed, but I didn't think we were here to decide that, whether they knocked too loud, whether they threatened to kick in the door. The opinion below says if they created the exigent circumstances, whether they did so lawfully or unlawfully, they cannot go in. And that's, that's the issue.",
  "That wasn't the basis for the decision below, though. The court below didn't say these police officers were behaving as though they had a warrant and were about to kick in the door. The opinion below just said, yes, there were exigent circumstances, but they were the result of the police knocking on the door and saying \"We're the police.\"",
  "Do you have any doubt that it's unlawful for a police officer to threaten to burst into a home?",
  "So why do you need unreasonable? If, indeed, there -- there was a threat of imminent entry -- we're going to bust down the -- if that was the threat, then it's unlawful, surely.",
  "The problem is that as reasonable as the test is, it's not the test that was used by the court below, and you want us to affirm the decision below, which simply said if the exigent circumstances are -- are the consequence of the police action, whatever the police action was -- lawful, reasonable, whatever -- the evidence has to be excluded. How can we affirm that decision as you want us to do, even -- even applying your test?",
  "It wouldn't technically be a Fourth Amendment violation, would it, if the police gave the impression that they had a warrant and were about to kick in the door? Is that a Fourth Amendment violation in and of itself?",
  "So your -- the -- the unlawfulness test would not prevent that then?",
  "It would not prevent it?",
  "Oh, whoa. Maybe we have to come up with an unreasonable test, then.",
  "Oh, it's perfectly okay for officers to do that? To pretend that they have a warrant and \"Open the door or we'll kick it in\" -­ that's perfectly okay?",
  "But why? You say that what they've done is not unlawful. Why would it be suppressed?",
  "Of course, you -- you would say that the subsequent plaintiff is not bound if he was not given notice and an opportunity to opt out, even if he came back to the same court, right? It would be a stupid thing to do.",
  "And he's probably going to lose, but you'd say he's not bound, right?",
  "I'm -- I'm the -- I'm the party trying to bring the later class action, and you tell me I can't do it because somebody else sought a class action, and -- and it -- and it was denied. And I say: Well, I don't care. I -- you know, that's somebody else. That was not me. I was not -- and not only was I not a party to that case, I think that person had a lousy lawyer, and had I chosen the lawyer, we wouldn't have lost that point. What's your response to that? You cannot even say, as you can where the class has been certified, well, at least there was a determination by some judge that the absent parties were adequately represented. There hasn't been even that determination.",
  "Well, you do that ex post.",
  "You want to litigate this later, and -­",
  "But it -- I'm sorry.",
  "How can you -- how can you possibly find that in the first action the lawyer understood that he was acting in a representative capacity?",
  "He tried to act in a -- but -- but his representation was denied.",
  "Yes, but then you go on to say: Moreover, give us -- give us the payment for the additional money beyond the 1.35 that you've already given us -­",
  "-- plus this additional money that we've expended.",
  "Well, why shouldn't we? I mean, it -- it seems to me if -- if, indeed, you say the government has come up with a defense that makes it impossible to decide who's in the right here -­",
  "-- why don't we just -- you know, I think the usual course taken by courts would be to leave the parties where they are. The matter can't be litigated. That would mean you would keep your $1.35 billion, but you wouldn't be entitled to sue for the additional amount. If -- if you were that worried, you should have -- you -- you should have had more frequent progress payments or something. Why don't we just leave you where you are, both you and the government, assuming we agree with you on all the rest?",
  "Yes, you would be 1.35 billion -­",
  "With interest. I forgot the interest.",
  "But the government didn't do that. I mean, you're making it up. The government didn't terminate for convenience. The government claimed you're in default. Why would -- why should we force that down the government's throat when we can no more say that the government's wrong than we can say that you're wrong?",
  "It seems to me you call the game off.",
  "Yes, but -­",
  "-- the fallacy is we're not -- assuming we agree with you on the rest, we're not saying that it's not a default termination. We're saying we don't know.",
  "We're saying we don't know. We don't know what the state-secrets thing is. The government is entitled to -- to make that determination, so we don't know who's in the right here.",
  "So why force the government to -- to go to a termination for convenience?",
  "Let's talk about \"moving party.\" I -- I don't -- I don't know that \"moving party\" means who comes into court first. I would -- I would -- in the -- in the context of a contract dispute, I would say the moving party is the party who is trying to use principles of law to change the contract, and that's the government here. The government -- the government is blowing the whistle; it is the government which is saying you are in default, and under the law, since you're in default, we can walk away, and indeed we can claim the money we've already paid you.",
  "That seems to me the moving party in the -- in the context of a contract.",
  "Reynolds was talking about that because that was the fact situation in Reynolds. But I'm saying that the logic of the matter -- the logic of the matter when applied to a contract situation such as this ought to be the party who is blowing the whistle, who is trying to use the law, the one -- the one who is asserting that -- that the law requires this result. And then we say, well, we can't tell whether the law requires this result or not. That, it seems to me, ought to be the moment of truth.",
  "It wasn't the undoubted right of the government before the lawsuit was filed. It was the undoubted right of the lawsuit only if the contracting officer was correct that there had been a default. If he was wrong about that, it was not the right of the government.",
  "No, but they -- they claim that you knew that it was impossible to do what they contracted with you to do at the weight of plane which they promised to come across with. They say that you knew that because of -- of other contracts that you had had, and yet didn't -- didn't tell them about it.",
  "I don't know whether that's true or not, and we're never going to know it's true, because you came in and blew the whistle and said: State-secrets privilege.",
  "Are you saying it was not impossible to do it at that weight?",
  "At the weight contracted for?",
  "I don't care how the contract's written. I mean, if we're going to -- if we're going to say that there's been a broken play, that we're not going to try to apply the contract because we can't tell who's in the right and who's in the wrong, it's totally irrelevant what the contract says. You just leave the parties where they are.",
  "You're -­",
  "To a moving party, and you are never the moving party.",
  "It's granting nobody relief. We're leaving you where you are. \"Get out of here,\" is what we're saying.",
  "We don't know what the answer is, so go away; we leave you where you are.",
  "That assumes that the contracting officer's termination for default was valid. And we don't know that it was valid, and we don't want to have to inquire whether it was valid. So to say \"go away\" means everybody keeps the money he has.",
  "Why is that unliquidated? I didn't get the distinction between -- why is the 1.35 unliquidated?",
  "What's the other? What's the -- what's the other 1.25 billion -­",
  "-- that he's also asking for?",
  "Right.",
  "It's the \"go away\" principle of our jurisprudence, right?",
  "But you don't say you waive it when -- when, in order to protect yourself for a debt that is owed to you, you make a claim in a bankruptcy proceeding. We do have a doctrine that you cannot -­ you cannot condition a Federal right upon the waiver of constitutional protections. And that seems to me what you're saying here. If you want to get paid by the bankrupt estate, you have to waive your -- your right to a -- to a jury trial.",
  "Would it have been normal for the bankruptcy judge to lift the stay with respect to a claim that could be presented in the bankruptcy proceeding?",
  "That can't be right. You -- you can take all sorts of matters that belong in Article III courts, and so long as you place them in some other tribunal where somebody is coerced into coming in, supposedly voluntarily, it's all okay. I mean, that's -- that's not an adequate protection.",

I mean, did some members of Congress who -­ who had passed FOIA say this is outrageous; what about the personal privacy of General Motors? I'm not aware of any objections along those lines.",
  "Is it the burden of the Government to show that they intended to exclude corporations, or is it your burden to show that this exception was meant to include corporations? I would think the latter is where the burden lies in this case.",
  "Well, but if you're asking the Government to show that the -- there was an intent to exclude corporations, I don't think that's their burden. I think it's your burden to show that this exemption was intended to include corporations.",
  "Well, it seems to me there are certainly some arguments you could make as a defendant for which you have no standing. You're saying there's no argument you can make as a defendant for which you have no standing?",
  "Suppose I raise an Establishment Clause objection in a matter that -- that does not involve legislation and which our recent opinions say therefore does not violate the Establishment Clause?",
  "No, you wouldn't. All you -- all you would have to know is that the claim is based upon a statute -- is not based upon a statute and that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence says if it's not based upon a statute, it doesn't violate the Establishment Clause.",
  "I'd say it's a Free Exercise Clause violation. I don't think you need the Establishment Clause for that.",
  "But that's a merits question rather than a standing question. I assume we're not getting into those merits questions here.",
  "All right. But you're confusing me. I thought we were just doing standing.",
  "Well, why couldn't you have said the same thing in TVA, that, while companies are -­ are -- not -- yes, the Federal -- the Federal statute requires the companies to charge this price, but they might have decided to charge it on their own anyway, and therefore you have no standing?",
  "Why isn't standard standing doctrine able to give you the protection that you're looking after? If indeed you can't tell whether the State did it because it was compelled to or because it wanted to, there was no causation and you don't have standing.",
  "I would rather use that route of analysis than inventing the new one that you're -- that you're urging upon us.",
  "Well, then let's use the one we already have and -- and not -- not have to get into developing one that I've never heard of before.",
  "You're trying to drive vinegar out of the interstate market? Do the people know you're trying to do this? Can you really argue that this statute is designed to drive vinegar out of the interstate market?",
  "Well, in a -- in another case, conceivably, the State Attorney General can exercise his or her prosecutorial discretion not to -­ not to prosecute this woman, or at least not to prosecute her under the antiterrorism law that gives her 8 years. Isn't that something for the State to be concerned about? We want to have the discretion of whether to prosecute or not for standard crimes that have no relation to interstate commerce or any other Federal power.",
  "She wants to make the argument that the definitions don't overlap. She wants to make the argument that this is a strictly State, local crime, and that any -- any attempt by the Federal Government to convert it into a treaty-based terrorism crime is -- is erroneous.",
  "That's what she's trying to do. Why doesn't she have standing to make that argument?",
  "But it does -- it does assume, as Justice Kennedy said, that the reason that is there in the Constitution is only for the benefits of the States, and not for the benefit of the people in the States. So if a State chooses to give it away, the -­ the individual has -- has no standing. You say it's third party, we're raising the States' rights. I think what the other sides is arguing; this is not a right of the States, it's a right of the individual to have the State take charge of certain matters and the Federal Government take charge of other matters. I don't see why that's any different from an Article I, section 8 claim.",
  "There -- there's a question of causality, so some of them will -- will not be valid because you can't show that the -- that the State was coerced into doing something and therefore you can't show that the violation of the Constitution caused your injury.",
  "It's not part of the rationale. The rationale for our decision would be (h)(1)(D) alone, and all the other discussion would be perfectly gratuitous, because we're going to set this individual free anyway. To say, well, this other thing is not a good reason to set them free, but this one is, I mean, that -- the former is just utterly irrelevant to our decision.",
  "I'm not disagreeing with you. I'm trying to help you.",
  "I'm sure it's not impermissible, but I'm also sure that if we do it, what we say about the ground for which we took the case would be -- would be the purest dictum.",
  "It's their fault; they shouldn't follow dictum, you know?",
  "No. You want to -­",
  "May I suggest that perhaps the reason not to do it is, assuming this person was treated entirely fairly on the basis of the law that existed at the time, the consequence of what Justice Breyer proposes is to set free someone who has been duly convicted of a crime.",
  "And to do that simply because, although the -- the process was perfectly fair when it was applied, there's been a change in the rule and therefore we don't redo it, but we let this person go; right?",
  "And can't be tried again.",
  "I don't -- I don't agree with that. Do you agree with that?",
  "You're not relying on the",

  "Regardless of the 2009?",
  "Mr. Fisher -- delay, you make an argument about the meaning of delay. I am troubled by the meaning of the \"from the filing of the motion\" of that clause. You read that, I think, to mean delay resulting from any pretrial moment and not to exceed -- right -- the peered of the filing of the filing of the motion to the conclusion of the hearing. Right? Isn't that right?",
  "Well, where do you -- where to you get that \"not to exceed\"? It doesn't say not to exceed; it says delay resulting from the filing of the motion.",
  "It's a funny way to say it. It's a funny way to say it.",
  "Can a -- can a sentencing judge be found to have abused his or her discretion in approving a plea -- a C plea agreement which provides for less than the minimum guideline sentence and gives no -- no particular reason for that? Would that be appealed as an invalid sentence?",
  "Well -­",
  "Let -- let me ask my question a different way. In deciding whether to approve the plea agreement, doesn't the judge have to consider whether it is an application of the guidelines, whether it is wildly inconsistent with the guidelines, whether it does not take into account valid reasons for departure from the guidelines?",
  "Then, if that's the case, then every plea agreement is based on the guidelines, every single one, because the judge always has to consider how do the guidelines apply to this plea agreement.",
  "Incidentally, and it sort of bears upon this discussion, are the guidelines mandatory when they are applied in approving a plea agreement? In other words, does Booker/Fanfan not apply to the application of the guidelines when a judge is -­ is approving a plea agreement? Do you think the guidelines are mandatory in that situation?",
  "But Justice Alito's hypothetical points out -- points up the fact that even though the agreement may mention the guidelines, it may do that just for the purpose of enabling the -- the judge more readily to approve the agreement, but there's no reason to believe that the government is interested in the guidelines, as opposed to being interested in putting this person away for a certain amount of time, especially when another count is dropped and the government says, well, I'll -- you know, I'll drop it if -- if this guy goes to prison for 2 years. But if the government had known he's not going for 2 years, he is only going for a year and a half or a year, the agreement might not have been concluded. So it really -- I mean, it doesn't further the intent of both parties, at least, to say when the guideline is changed, the agreement changes.",
  "Mr. Gannon, you assert that the -- within the language of the statutory provision, the sentence here is not based on the guidelines, but it's based on the agreement, and the agreement arguably is based on the guidelines.",
  "If -- if you take that position, that \"based on\" means determined by absolutely, then I don't think any sentence would ever be based on the guidelines after Booker/Fanfan.",
  "The guidelines form part of the consideration of the judge, but the judge's decision is not based on the guidelines. Just as here, the -­ the agreement -- the guidelines form part of what produces the agreement, so also they form part of what produces the judge's decision. And it seems to me, if that's going to be enough for the judge's determination, it ought to be the same for the agreement.",
  "No, but let's -- let's assume there is no plea agreement.",
  "You -- you have a judge who sentences post-Booker/Fanfan. Now, his sentence is not based on the guidelines any more -­",
  "-- any more than this agreement is based on the guidelines. The guidelines are one of the things that he must take into account and does take into account in determining the sentence. Now, if that is enough for purposes of determining whether this statute -- statutory provision applies to a sentence imposed directly by a judge, it seems to me the same analysis ought to apply to a sentence imposed through a plea agreement.",
  "So you -- you acknowledge that \"based on\" covers post-Booker/Fanfan sentences by the judge?",
  "Yes. Yes. Yes. MR. GANNON -- a specific sentence rendered under type C that -- on page 28 of our brief, we acknowledge that in most contexts, it's -- it's open to -- to contend that the sentence was based on the relevant guidelines -­",
  "Even though -- even though the guidelines are just one of the things that have to be taken into account?",
  "You were about to tell us where it is?",
  "You're reading a different --",
  "He is reading the commentary.",
  "And that's okay, as far as you're concerned? You would consider that comes within your first test?",
  "Would not, but willful blindness would?",
  "So even willful blindness wouldn't be enough?",
  "Well, why -- why wouldn't you tell him? If you're -- if you're honestly interested in finding out whether there is a patent that you're infringing, why wouldn't you tell me the reason we're concerned is that we have reverse-engineered this from somebody else's product? Just check to see if SEB has a patent on any of this stuff that we've reverse-engineered. That's what I would have done.",
  "Was their practice to reverse-engineer from other people's products?",
  "I mean, I can understand when you have a new product of your own; of course, you just give it to an attorney. But when you have reverse-engineered, not to tell them that it was reversed-engineered seems to me really trying to keep yourself in the dark. What you want to get from the attorney is a piece of paper that he can show to Montgomery Ward that, yes, this product is not -- as it turns out, Montgomery Ward did accept it and got hit with liability for infringing a patent. I -- I find that really incredible that, in an honest attempt to find whether there was any patent infringement going on, you wouldn't even tell the patent attorney that you've reverse-engineered somebody else's product.",
  "No, they wouldn't.",
  "Well, we're not going to adopt a special rule for the deep-fryer industry.",
  "Especially -­",
  "Listen, the -- the reason you got the opinion from the lawyer was -- was not to make sure that there were no patents. It was to show that opinion to Montgomery Ward.",
  "As a practical matter, you needed an opinion from a lawyer, because otherwise, Montgomery Ward was not going to sell this stuff.",
  "No, more than that.",
  "Wait. Before you go -­ before you go further, what if you do that, okay? And you get an opinion from a lawyer, as they did here, saying you're not violating any copyright or any -- any patent?",
  "Okay. You have to tell the searcher that you copied.",
  "That is part of your test, right?",
  "Well, one of the -- one of the briefs -- one of the amicus briefs in this case points out that that argument is a lot less plausible in copyright than it is in -- in patents. It is very easy to find out whether you're infringing a copyright. It is very difficult to find out whether you're infringing a patent, especially in the modern age of warehouse patents. I am not sure that we -- that we want to use the same test for copyrights that we use for -- for patents.",
  "Well, that's fine. I am just -- I am just expressing reservations about your suggestion that we simply take Grokster wholesale and apply it to this situation.",
  "He is not interested in what happened here. I mean, we are still talking about a general test.",
  "Just -- just as a hypothetical, suppose -- suppose it was as Justice Ginsburg suggested; or indeed suppose this individual even before he was employed by Stanford at all, much less employed by a Stanford project funded by the Federal Government, entered into this kind of an agreement with somebody that he had been working for. How -- how would it -­",
  "How does that change when you -- when you alter the hypothetical so that he was already an employee of Stanford, but was not working as an employee of Stanford when he was at this other company? You could still say that -- that Stanford was not the inventor.",
  "Plus the word \"retained,\" don't forget that, too.",
  "But this isn't vesting it in the United States. This is -- this is speaking of the -- the university retaining title. If -- if the government was going to make such a huge change from normal patent law where the inventor owns his invention until he assigns it to his employer, why wasn't that set forth clearly? All they needed was one paragraph.",
  "It says when you're working on a -- on a government-funded project, you have no right to your invention as an -- as an employee. It automatically vests in the -- in the university. I would have expected that to be set forth very clearly if -- if they were making such an immense change in patent law.",
  "Excuse me. I lost you. Go over that again.",
  "Yes, where is that?",
  "Got you.",
  "I don't understand that. Why can't the Federal government just say: We're not going to fund your project unless you get assignments of inventions by all the employees working on it? What's the problem?",
  "And by -- and by the Federal 0 voluntary decision to provide funds. I mean, certainly you can condition your grant of funds on that. I -- I really don't see the problem.",
  "Is that patent law or is it regular contract law? Doesn't it apply in other fields as well? I mean, I'm -- I'm not aware that this is a peculiar doctrine applicable to patent law.",
  "To do it in the future. If somebody else gets an assignment before that agreement is -- is executed, the assignment prevails.",
  "It could refuse to fund.",
  "It could refuse to fund without a clear assignment upfront.",
  "The Federal Government hadn't been doing much with the parents that it acquired automatically?",
  "That's the reason they gave it to the university or to the private sector.",
  "I don't understand that. I can understand the argument that -- that Congress was -­ was directing its statute at crack, and crack had -- had a very definite meaning, which didn't include any substance that -- that is rock-hard and has been produced in the manner you suggest. You're coming up -- you're urging upon us a definition that neither is the definition of crack nor is the chemical definition of cocaine base. It's neither fish nor fowl.",
  "Crack.",
  "That's right. But you don't argue that. That's not the meaning you want us to give it.",
  "It's essential to crack.",
  "You wouldn't call it crack if it weren't made that way, would you?",
  "How does \"cocaine base\" suggest what you want? It has to be -- it has to be rock and it has to be base cocaine produced in one of the fashions you suggested. I don't know how \"cocaine base\" remotely suggests that.",
  "All of them or just crack?",
  "Mr. Pincus, you've lost me. You've responded to the Chief Justice when he raised the problem that this has to be not just cocaine base, it has to be a mixture containing cocaine base, you responded to him by saying: Well, crack always has some mixture in it; it's never -- it's never pure; and that's why crack would be covered. But in response to Justice Alito, who asked you what if it's pure, if it's pure cocaine base, without any admixtures, you said that would still be covered. I mean, both answers can't be right.",
  "Yes.",
  "As a practical matter what difference does it make? Is the government going to be prosecuting anybody for possessing coca leaves?",
  "I don't think Congress knew what this chemical debate was all about. I -- I think it's very unlikely.",
  "Let's assume that the government's right and -- or that you're right. And that it's -- no, let's assume the government's right, and it is -- no, you say it's base.",
  "You say it's both, but it includes base.",
  "And let's assume you're right. So what?",
  "I would assume that your major objection would not be that. Your major objection would be: We're not supposed to be writing a statute, we're supposed to be interpreting one. And there is no way to -- to get that out of these words, no way, absolutely no way. Is there?",
  "Is it -­",
  "Is it not relatively common statutory drafting to include something in an earlier section which is also included in a later section that imposes a higher penalty? For example, as I recall from my criminal -- criminal law courses, States have statutes that provide that the taking of a human life, homicide, is -- is punishable by so much; and then it says the taking of a human life with malice aforethought is punishable by more. Now, does -- does the second include the first? Of course it does. It includes the first and then something. And it seems to me that's the same thing here. It includes the first, the cocaine, but it has to be within a compound mixture of preparation.",
  "Ms. Saharsky, coming back to Romanette (iii), you have 50 grams or more of a mixture or substance described in clause 2. Doesn't -­ it really doesn't have to be a mixture. It could be pure, couldn't it? It says \"mixture or substance,\" not mixture.",
  "It's the same with homicide and murder. Every murder, every murder, is a homicide.",
  "Not so fast.",
  "What I was about to ask is this: I can agree with you that -- that where there is a -- a determination on the merits, it should be reviewable, but could still disagree that it's reviewable where the requirements for Article III are not met; that is, where there is really no justiciable controversy between the parties. What -- what is the interest of the -- of the parties who were victorious here?",
  "But it takes -­",
  "It takes two to tango, and a case or controversy requires somebody on the other side who cares a fig about the outcome. And here, S.G., who was the -- the young woman affected in the case, has moved to another State and -- making it virtually certain that she'll never confront this situation again. She doesn't care what the result of this thing is. Besides which, I think she's, what, 17 years old or so now? It's impossible that she will be confronted with the same situation.",
  "How does it affect the Fourteenth Amendment? There's a Fourteenth Amendment claim pending below?",
  "And what's the substance of that?",

  "There are different panels on the Ninth Circuit, aren't there?",
  "And -- and they don't all hold the same thing, fortunately, do they?",

  "But that wouldn't be the case if the opinion were vacated -­",
  "-- under Munsingwear?",
  "Why? What's the test? Isn't the test clearly established law?",
  "Would this be clearly established law under any -- any conceivable interpretation of that?",
  "So, you want us -- so Munsingwear. You don't want us just to leave it sitting because there's no controversy; you want us to erase that holding below, right?",
  "Well, then -- then the answer you just gave doesn't make any sense. You say it can -- you know, it can arise again. That would be the answer of someone who wants us to eliminate the holding here: Don't worry; it will come up again in a context where, on appeal, somebody will have an interest in arguing to -- to sustain it, but that interest doesn't exist here. That's the argument you're making, but that's the argument of someone -­",
  "-- who wants us to Munsingwear.",
  "I don't understand. It seems like a very strange rule to me. You mean it's okay for a child protection worker to just ask the child passing in the hall, you know, has your -- or not passing in the hall. Come into this room, I have a question for you: Has your father been abusing you? And if the child says yes, thank you, and the child goes, then that's okay?",
  "Because it was a short interview?",
  "Oh.",
  "Right. Take her into a room. I see that.",
  "But once they take her in a room, it depends on how long the interview is; is that right?",
  "Whatever.",
  "We're talking about rules for the future; we're not talking about this case, and you're asking us to adopt a rule for the future that says if it's very brief, it's okay, but if it's longer it isn't okay. Right? That's what you want us to adopt?",
  "No, no, no, no. Removed. There has been a seizure, but it's been a very brief seizure, just as a Terry stop is a very brief seizure.",
  "So you're changing your position: You need a court order, no matter how brief; is that it?",
  "Oh, okay.",
  "If you send her to the school nurse, it's not a seizure, but if the school doesn't have a nurse and it brings in a nurse from the outside and say, you know, we think you have some contagious disease, we would like you to speak to this -- then it becomes a seizure?",
  "Contagious, it's just a disease that's going to kill this child and nobody else, okay?",
  "Okay.",
  "So why doesn't it -­ likewise, it's not a nurse, but it's a social worker who's brought in to interrogate the child about something else that is going to very much harm that child, why is that any different?",
  "It has nothing to do with whether there's a seizure, nothing whatever to do with whether there's a seizure.",
  "The questions you ask after the seizure don't make it a seizure or make it not a seizure, do they?",
  "She's helping you, I think.",
  "She's helping you, I think.",
  "But -- but that goes to the reasonableness of the seizure. I was asking you about whether there has been a seizure. Step one, has there been a seizure? And you're saying that in a lot of these situations there simply hasn't been a seizure. Now, once there is a seizure, then we can inquire to whether it's unreasonable or not. But -- but those are two distinct questions, and -- and we've been discussing the mere existence of a seizure. Now, true in this case it was already conceded, but you're asking us to adopt a rule for future cases, and we can't adopt a rule for future cases until we know what we're talking about when -- when -- when we talk about a seizure.",
  "Not always. Not always. Only when there is no longer a case in controversy. In -- in many cases there will still be a case or controversy.",
  "It will be something that could be replicated again in the future for some other reason. It -- it isn't true that it will just eliminate the whole purpose of our -- of our jurisprudence in this area. In many cases the -- the decision below can be appealed, and -- and we will rule on the -- on the constitutional question.",
  "But you moved away, I mean if -- you know, it's a different situation.",
  "Well, so then walking along the hall in the school, right?",
  "Just come up alongside: \"By the way, I wanted to ask you whether your mother --\"",
  "Well -­",
  "Give us -- give us your definition. You say you're not standing by the dictionary definition -­",
  "-- that was read. You're -- what is your definition? It's not just reports of investigations into fraud. What else is it?",
  "Do you know any -- any dictionary that gives that definition? I mean, the advantage of -- of the Petitioners' is they use a -- a dictionary definition. It may be a very broad one and you don't like it for that reason, but it is the way the word is sometimes used.",
  "I don't know any dictionary that would define the word the way you say it.",
  "Don't we have to say why? Don't we have to say why they are they are that?",
  "And once we have to say why, we're -- we're getting into the need for defining what a report is.",
  "We don't usually just say yes, no; you know, we usually give reasons.",
  "Let's talk about the purpose of the statute. Surely, that should bear upon how you read the -- what you read the words to mean. I had thought that the purpose was as -- as Petitioner's counsel said, the purpose was to allow people to bring qui tam actions who have their own information and who are not just relying on information that they -- that is not personal to them. Is that accurate or not?",
  "He only knows that because of the FOIA response.",
  "Because -- because the agency said we don't have any reports for those 5 years. Why isn't that information from the agency a report by the agency that we don't have any documents from those 5 years, and, therefore, your client says they didn't file documents for those 5 years?",
  "But your client would search if they weren't filed, and on the basis of no other information except this FOIA response.",
  "How else does your client know that there were no reports filed for these years, which is part of the -- part of the claim here?",
  "He wasn't there during those years, was he?",
  "You don't understand the circumstance.",
  "I don't -- I don't want to have to play these games every time there's -­ there's -- there's one of these qui tam actions. I mean, the advantage of Petitioner's solution is that it -- it's easy -- it's easy to apply. I don't find yours easy to apply at all.",
  "What about police witnesses? What about not requiring the officer who -­ who took the confession or who witnessed the alleged crime -- not requiring him to appear because he's busy?",
  "Can't make it. He's out on the beat. So can we have him appear by television?",
  "Why -- why is a lab technician different?",
  "The State takes its chances, right? I mean, as to how much it has to bring in, in order to persuade the jury?",
  "Does not Melendez-Diaz also say that if the defendant wants to challenge the -- the chain of custody, the State can adopt rules that requires the defendant to assert that challenge or his intention to make that challenge, or his intention to make that challenge, prior to the trial so that the State will know whether it has to introduce any live testimony?",
  "Mr. Fisher, I thought -- I thought the Court put this worry behind us in Crawford. Wasn't the same worry raised in Crawford?",
  "Said, yes, it may be something of a risk, but the States have managed it in the past, and there's no reason to think they can't manage it in the future.",
  "Wasn't it the case that these tests are unusual in this particular jurisdiction?",
  "Well, I assume that even if he doesn't remember, his testimony is not worthless to the prosecution. He -- the prosecution can bring out his high qualifications, and he can testify: It -- this is always the way I do it. I do it this way all the time. I don't remember this particular incident. All of that can be persuasive to the jury, can't it?",
  "I don't understand that. You mean so long as all -- all hearsay by non-police officers can be admitted without, without confrontation, just because they're not police officers?",
  "I didn't think that was your point, because it's certainly not true, is it?",
  "And that was prepared just for fun, not for use in trial?",
  "So what difference does it make whether the statute requires it to be taken to be used at trial or whether the police send it over to be used at trial as a use of the State? What difference does that make?",
  "This analyst was fired, as I recall. Was he fired, placed on administrative leave or something?",
  "On leave without pay?",
  "And do we know why it was leave without pay?",
  "Does the defense know why it was leave without pay? Could the defense have found out in cross-examination that the reason he was leave without pay because he was -- had shown himself to be incompetent, and they were in the process of firing him? I don't know whether that's true, but wouldn't that be important to the defense?",
  "And didn't -- and didn't the prosecution intentionally set it up this way so that this person would not have to testify, so that he could not be cross-examined? Isn't that why they sent the substitute to testify?",
  "I don't know what the facts are, but boy, it smells bad to me. It really does. And even if that was not the case, the mere possibility that it could have been the case shows why you should have to bring this person in if you want to introduce his testimony.",
  "I agree that whether it's testimonial does not depend upon whether there's skullduggery or not, but the possibility of skullduggery, even in machine -- machine situations such as this, is a good reason for saying this is testimonial.",
  "Well, not the same information. One would say the police submitted it and the other one would say the defendant submitted it, right?",
  "So if the police submitted it, the -- the person doing the -- the test would know that the police submitted it, I assume.",
  "Why is a key question whether this was an interrogation? Does the Confrontation Clause apply only to confrontations? To interrogations? I mean, if a -- if a witness, before the police ask any questions, blurts out, you know, \"Jones did it,\" can that statement get in because it has not been in response to an interrogation?",
  "It would be different because interrogation doesn't make any difference. That is not the condition for the application of the -- of the Confrontation Clause.",
  "If it were an interrogation, the factors mentioned in Michigan v. Bryant would be relevant, presumably, but since this wasn't an interrogation, I don't see how that has any -­ any relevance whatever.",
  "Well, he'd look at the report and say, gee, I don't remember; you know, I do a lot of these reports. But then the prosecution in direct would say, well, how do you do them? And he would say, I always do this, I always do that, I always do the other thing. Did you do it in this case? Well, I don't specifically remember this case, but I always do it. And that's the testimony that would go to the jury. It would be pretty persuasive. Not as good as if he did remember.",
  "The chain of custody wasn't -- wasn't contested here, was it?",
  "Is it often contested? My impression is it's not very often contested.",
  "General, I know your State takes a different view of it or you wouldn't be here, but aren't there are a number of States that -- that do provide the testimony of the technician, who do require the technician to come in and -- and testify?",
  "And have they had, to your knowledge, serious problems about defendants contesting chain of custody simply because this other thing is required? Again, I'm -- I'm not aware that that's been a problem. I think it's a boogeyman.",
  "Well, I -- I don't think that's an accurate response, at least if you include the qualification that Justice Breyer put in the question, which is that the records were kept with the knowledge that they would be introduced in -- in criminal trials. I mean, you can say that all the records of labs -- let's assume there's a -- there's a police lab which -- which only does police testing of blood. Those would be business records of the lab, but they certainly would not be introducible just because they're business records. If the record is made for the use in prosecution, surely it's -- it doesn't come under the business records exception, or else we wouldn't be here today.",
  "It's an independent lab and police always send it to this independent lab, but in fact it's an independent business, it makes a profit; but all the stuff it does it knows is going to be used at trial. That wouldn't be admissible, would it? Even though it's a perfectly normal business record.",
  "General, I -- I don't want to eat up your -- your little remaining time, I think you can answer yes or no. Does New Mexico assert the same rule as applicable to ballistics testing?",
  "Why?",
  "Certainly not.",
  "But you -- you -- you think the result would be a -- the same if we could develop a machine that you put the bullet in and -- and -- and -­ that's been fired from this gun, and the murder bullet, and the machine goes, blah, blah, blah, and it spits out, you know, 99 percent, 99.9 percent match, that would be okay?",
  "Not under oath, though, that's the only difference?",
  "Can I ask whether your second reason doesn't boil down to saying that it makes very little difference whether -- whether Ashcroft is -­ is held immune by absolute immunity or by qualified immunity?",
  "Once -- once you say that -- that motive is not introducible with regard to the qualified immunity question, and once you say that he's using a witness subpoena, and you can't look behind it as to whether he was abusing it for some other purpose, is there any difference between absolute and qualified immunity?",
  "Well, I thought the -- I thought the argument, rather, was that this is not as close to the core of the prosecutorial function as some of the other functions to which we have given absolute immunity, and since it's so dangerous, since there is such potential for abuse, we shouldn't confer absolute immunity on this particular conduct. But I don't understand why if we agree with you on qualified immunity, there is any difference whatever.",
  "Right.",
  "Was the prosecution already pending when this -- when this warrant was issued?",
  "I don't see -­",
  "I don't see how that would make any difference to the -- at least to the absolute immunity question. You wouldn't assert that there is absolute immunity if there's a statute such as this, but there is not if there isn't. I mean, either this is core prosecutorial function for which he can't be sued or it isn't. So what difference does this statute make as far -- as far as absolute immunity is concerned?",
  "Okay.",
  "So for us to agree with you on absolute immunity, we -- we would have to believe that even if there were no such statute and if a prosecutor simply detained somebody as a material witness without any check of a -- of an independent magistrate, he would be immune?",
  "And you can't look behind that, right? You can't look behind that? If the -- if the judge has said it's material, that's the end of it; you have absolute immunity, right?",
  "Can appeal the -- the judge's determination that -- that it's material?",
  "Well, then how can you have absolute immunity?",
  "Oh, you mean at the time it's issued?",
  "I see.",
  "Well, what if you didn't have -- again, what if you didn't have this prescribed judicial process?",
  "Well, there are procedures set forth in the statute, I'd say you would add, which you think are not necessary, but are there in order to make them flinch in a different -- in a different -­",

  "But the Fourth Amendment doesn't say you need probable cause. There are situations where you can conduct a search without probable cause. There's the Terry search. There's administrative searches. There's a lot of exceptions.",
  "Administrative searches, automobile searches, you know.",
  "You're -- you're going way beyond what I thought you were arguing. You're saying you always have to make that determination of good faith, right? In -- in all cases, including when the prosecution is -- is accused of -- of bringing a prosecution purely for harassment purposes?",
  "That's what I thought you were saying.",
  "Excuse me. You lose me in the argument because it doesn't seem to me that we -- if we did apply the good faith rule, we would be denying retroactive effect to the altered judgment. It continues to apply to matters beforehand, but it's a totally different question whether, assuming it is retroactive, the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies. It's a -- it's a separate question from retroactivity, it seems to me.",
  "It's not a label at all. You're -- we're not denying the application of the altered rule to your client's conduct. It applies. But the question of whether, when it does apply, the good faith disregard of it by a police officer nonetheless allows the evidence to be admitted, it's a totally different -- we're giving full retroactive effect to the -- to the change in the law.",
  "Mr. Kerr, I've been on the bench 30 years or so now. I have never, never heard counsel come before the court and say that we should overrule a case without making the argument: The facts of this case are not within the prior decision anyway. It just doesn't happen.",
  "There was still not the argument you should overrule the prior case, period, with no effort to show why you could come out that way without overruling the prior cases. I just don't know -­",
  "I'm saying they're nonexistent. I'm not saying they're rare.",
  "I assume if Petitioner says we should be able to overrule our prior substantive precedent, he should also logically say that we should be able to overrule our prior precedent regarding the exclusionary rule. So that whenever somebody wants to come up here to challenge prior precedent, he can just say: You know, Your Honors, we're asking you to overrule two cases: The first one, the substantive rule of Fourth Amendment law; and secondly, whether that -­ that change in law can govern the action of the policeman who didn't realize that the law was going to be changed.",
  "And if he asks for the double overruling that I just suggested, I guess there's some chance that the Court would do it?",
  "I don't think it's so complicated, counsel. Don't worry about it.",
  "Actually, why don't we just abolish the exclusionary rule? That would be really simple. Whatever evidence tends to prove the truth comes in. That would be a very simple system if we're looking for just simplicity, wouldn't it?",
  "You're not proposing that, though?",
  "I assume that an officer when he goes out to do his job does not have primarily in mind not to get sued, but I think primarily in mind he wants to arrest somebody in such a manner that the person can be convicted of the crime that he's done, right?",
  "I don't think we'd look particularly good, either, do you? I mean, if. We had one case raising a Fourth Amendment question, and let's say six others who raise -- that raise the same question, what would we do? We would grant the first and hold the second? No use to hold the second, because they're going to lose anyway, right?",
  "So I guess we would -- we would just grant the first and deny all the rest, even though they're raising the same issue?",
  "It doesn't smell very good.",
  "Was -- was -- was the poisonous fruit the DMV records, or was the poisonous fruit the fact that this person who is contained in the records was the one driving the car? Why wasn't that the -- why wasn't that the fruit? I mean, the records were there anyway. What -- what -- what new information came from the stop was the fact that that is the person who was driving the car. Why -- why didn't -- why wasn't that what should have been suppressed?",
  "I would agree with you on that fruit. Did -- did you ask for that to be suppressed?",
  "But that's not what's before us here, right?",
  "Not -- not if you allow the suppression of the policeman's identification of the individual driving the car. I mean, that -- nobody's contending that that can't be suppressed. So if you can't bring in the policeman to say, yes, this fellow Smith, whose record we have here, was the fellow driving the car. Once that's out, what incentive is there to make these suspicionless stops?",
  "What I'm saying is, you're getting at it from the wrong end. What should have been suppressed was the policeman's identification of the person who was driving the car.",
  "Well, it -- it gets you nowhere to say John Smith. You have to say John Smith was driving the car. It's the driving of the car that you want suppressed. That's not the identity. I mean, John Smith, fine, you can say John Smith, John Smith, John Smith all you like at court. It's -- it's not going to get a conviction. But when you say John Smith was driving the car, then you are eliciting testimony from the officer concerning information he would not have had but for the stop, that John Smith was driving the car, right?",
  "I was going to ask that. She said that -­",
  "-- your -- your friend said that it was raised below. What -- what happened to it?",
  "You agree that the Petition Clause is -- is different and does have a separate content?",

  "But it seems to me you're either petitioning the government or you're not petitioning the government. Why -- why shouldn't the line be, if you're petitioning the government as employer is different from petitioning the government as ruler? Why shouldn't that be the line that we draw?",
  "Which wouldn't necessarily break out the same way as whether it's a matter of private concern versus a matter of public concern.",
  "But the core -- the core of the Petition Clause is petitioning. The core of the Free Speech Clause is political speech, of course -­ speech in public interest -- but the core of the Petition Clause is quite different. It's simply whether you're petitioning. Surely you -- you could petition the -- most of the petitions in the early years were regarding private matters; isn't that right?",
  "That's true, and it seems to me the -- the core is involved whenever you're asking for a change. And it seems to me that the key distinction, if there is one, is whether you're asking for a change in -- by your employer in your employment conditions or a change by the government in some matters over which the government has control as -- as sovereign.",
  "It may well be, may well be.",
  "Would they have to do both? Would they have to do both?",
  "If you're proceeding with a claim under two separate provisions of the Constitution, it should not be surprising that you might have two different tests.",
  "I think all you're saying is that one of the elements of Pickering balancing is the element of Petition Clause jurisprudence, as I suggested it -- it might be applied; that is, in Pickering balancing, certainly you have to ask, was what the individual was asking for a change in employment conditions? That would be one of the questions. If so, it was a private matter, and then you go on to the rest of the balancing. But it seems to me you have to make that determination under Pickering balancing anyway, and once you make it, you've answered the -- the Petition Clause question.",
  "Of course, you have to wrestle with the same problem if you apply the other test that you -- you were proposing.",
  "Namely, whether it's a private matter or a matter of public concern. You confront the same difficulty, don't you?",
  "If -- if lawsuits are covered by the Petition Clause, why is it that in the innumerable cases this Court has had concerning what due process of law consists of, we've never mentioned what the Petition Clause requires. I mean, if the Petition Clause guarantees access to the courts, certainly there are some minimum requirements that it imposes as well, and I don't recall any of our cases dealing with lawsuits that mention the Petition Clause. That's rather extraordinary if indeed it governs all lawsuits.",
  "Maybe that's all they had in mind, or petitions to the executive as well. What -­ what evidence do you have that it applied to lawsuits?",
  "I agree with you that that's slender.",
  "What -- wouldn't a -- a written letter to -- to the employer, the government employer, similarly be a petition? Is a lawsuit any more of a petition, if indeed it is a petition at all, which I doubt? Surely filing a statement with the employer is a petition as well. So how does the form make any difference?",
  "Well, let's talk about it. I find it difficult to believe that lawsuits are covered by the Petition Clause when it is very clear that the Congress can prevent all lawsuits against the Federal Government by simply refusing to waive sovereign immunity. Now, you know, how can you have a constitutional guarantee of the right to petition the government, which you say includes the -- the right to -- to be in law court, and yet the Federal Government can exempt itself from suits in law courts?",
  "I'm not talking about just a lower court system. I'm talking about all suits, right up to the Supreme Court. The Federal Government can say: You can't sue us.",
  "You're saying that the Petition Clause only covers those petitions that the government chooses to allow; is -- is that what the constitutional guarantee is? If you choose to allow a certain kind of petition, it is constitutionally guaranteed. That's not much of a guarantee.",
  "What's the earliest English or American case you have that refers to a lawsuit as protected by the Petition Clause?",
  "How many?",
  "40 years ago.",
  "So for a couple hundred years, nobody -- nobody connected the two?",
  "Well, wait. I mean, my goodness. You could say the same underlying facts justify, you know, a suit for -- for libel, and also justify a much -- a much greater suit. I'm not sure that we look to simply the underlying facts. We look to what kind of liability was sought to be imposed upon the defendant. That's what determines how much money the defendant is willing to pay for his lawyer, and how much he has to expend in defending.",
  "So how do you calculate that? I mean that -- that's what the question was.",
  "But that's not why we took the case, to correct the factual application.",
  "So they messed up the application of the but-for test. I thought the issue before us whether -- was going to be whether the but-for test is a proper test, not whether this particular court, having expressed a proper rule, misapplied it. I don't care about that.",
  "I don't -- you -- you -­ you've done this several times in the course of your argument, sort of equating, you know, the attorney's fees for frivolous suits with the normal attorney's fees that the plaintiff gets when the plaintiff is victorious. I'm not sure that we should treat the two situations about the same, because the plaintiff gets his attorney's fees whenever the plaintiff wins, whenever the plaintiff wins, whereas the defendant gets those fees only when the plaintiff has brought a frivolous suit, which should not have been done, which is wrongful, which is perhaps sanctionable under Rule 11. I'm not sure that we have to evenhandedly apply the same kind of rules.",
  "You want to us decide this case on the basis that it was only -- it was only a 1983 claim for the entire time it was in Federal Court until the -- until the very end, right?",
  "What -- what good does that do? I mean, is that why we took this case?",
  "What principle of law that's going to help the lower Federal courts would come out of that holding?",
  "Whenever you have nothing but a 1983 case, you can give -- and it's frivolous, you can give attorney's fees right up to the limit of the fees expended, right?",
  "Well, I think nobody doubts that, do they?",
  "Oh, no, but you're saying they were only attributable to a 1983 claim during all of this litigation except the very end.",
  "Ms. Blackman, I'm -- I'm -- I'm not clear on what you are proposing. Is there to be one different Miranda requirement rule for all minors, or is there to be one for, what, 20-year-olds, 19-year-olds, 18-year-olds, 17, 16? This one is 13, do we calibrate it that finely -­",
  "-- or do we just say, you know, what would a minor -- I don't know, a general minor regard as restrictions upon his departure?",
  "I understand that.",
  "So you mean 15, 14, 13, 13 1/2? Right?",
  "It's not -- if not calibrated by age, how is it to be calibrated?",
  "Common sense?",
  "And -- and -- and how -­ how is the law enforcement officer going into the confrontation going to know whether a judge is going to be applying a 15-year-old rule, a 13-year-old rule, or whatever?",
  "Do you think that's clear?",
  "What about mental deficiency, if -- if age should be one of the factors, deciding whether the individual regarded himself as in custody or not, why shouldn't mental deficiency be so as well? Is there any -- any basis in principle for not -- I mean, once you do this, don't you, in effect, say that it is a subjective inquiry whether the particular individual regarded him or herself as being in custody; isn't that the -- the basis of what you're arguing?",
  "No? Why is age different from mental deficiency, for example?",
  "You could say both of those things about the mentally deficient. They may regard themselves as -- as unfree to leave, and they have cognitive deficiencies.",
  "Even -- even if you said no, you're pushing us there, because there's no basis for treating a childhood any differently from these other factors. So basically you're saying Justice Breyer would call it objective circumstances. You know, whether you're mentally deficient, I would call that the subjective condition of the -- of the person being held in custody. And I think, I don't think that's what we meant by the phrase \"objective circumstances.\" But you want objective circumstances to include the character of the person being held in custody, whether he's mentally deficient, whether he's schizophrenic, known to the police, you know, whatever factors, right? Those are all objective circumstances?",

  "Are you answering my question?",

  "Some people don't -- some people don't read the sentence. He may not have read it.",
  "He probably couldn't leave the classroom, either, could he, the classroom where he was studying?",
  "So the -- the additional coercive effect of not being able to leave probably didn't make a whole lot of difference. He knew he was stuck where his parents had put him, in the school. And if the school sent him to a classroom, he had to be in the classroom; and if the school sent him to a place where he could, if he wished, voluntarily speak to the police officers, he had to be there.",

He just has less data, and it's easy to take account of less data; easier to take account of less data than it is to take account of how different one's mind is because he's 16 instead of 13 or whatever. That's the difference between the blind and the deaf, isn't it?",
  "The officer doesn't have to think like a 13-year-old, he has to think the way a 60-year-old judge would think a 13-year-old thought, right?",
  "Why don't we require Miranda always?",
  "Is there any harm in requiring it always? It's always easy to do. Why don't we require it all the time? Can you tell us why it makes a difference?",
  "We don't want Miranda warnings to be given where they are unnecessary because they are only necessary to prevent coercion, and where there's no coercion, we want confessions, don't we? And the Miranda warnings deter confessions.",
  "Isn't that the basic reason?",
  "So it's not cost-free to require Miranda warnings.",
  "It's a good thing to have the bad guys confess that they're bad guys, right?",
  "It's -- it's a formal adversary proceeding in a very limited sense and not in the sense that caused us to require counsel to be provided in criminal proceedings where the other side is armed with the legal knowledge that the poor defendant does not have.

  "I'm talking of counsel. Is it not true that many, perhaps most, of these proceedings do not have counsel on the other side? It is the wife who is trying to get payment of -- of the -­ of the defaulted alimony and does not have counsel -­",

  "If -- if he can't pay.",

  "Mr. Bibas, I have a question about -- about the position of the Government in this case. The Government agrees with you that you don't need counsel, but says that we ought to reverse the judgment anyway because there were -- because the other aspects of due process which the Government asserts would make it unnecessary to provide counsel did not exist in this case. Did you think, under our ordinary rules, we -- we can do that?",
  "Question presented was just whether counsel was necessary, right?",
  "It's fully within the power of the Government to say why, you know, in general counsel is not necessary because these other procedures are good enough. But then to come forward and say, moreover, those procedures were not applied in this case and, therefore, you should reverse, that's -- that's a new point, it seems to me, isn't it?",
  "I would think that the rule would be that if -- if South Carolina has not complied with minimum due process procedures, minimum due process procedures are required, not counsel is required.",
  "I don't understand all of this discussion. The question presented is not what due process procedures are required in these cases. That is not the question presented.",
  "It is simply whether counsel is necessary. Isn't that the only matter that we should be discussing?",
  "The Government is not a party here, is it?",
  "It's just an amicus. So, this expansion of the -- of the question presented from whether counsel was necessary to what are the due process procedures required is all at the suggestion of an amicus; is that right?",
  "Could I ask a question about your mootness point?",
  "You say it's --it's not capable of repetition and yet evading review, because should this happen again, he could get a stay, as he could have gotten in this case. Do you have any case of ours which -- which uses that reasoning and says the fact that in a future case you may be able to get a stay suffices to establish that this is not capable of repetition yet evading review? It's -- it's a new argument to me. Is there any case of ours that applies it?",
  "Counsel, I don't understand how we could say that if you do not meet minimum due process procedures, you must meet more than minimum due process procedures. I mean, once we say that it's enough if you do A, B, and C, but this State has not done A, B, and C, how can we say therefore you must appoint counsel? All we can say is you must do A, B, and C. I don't know of any instance where we impose more than the due process minimum because you have failed to comply with the minimum.",
  "But juries usually find against railroads anyway, right?",
  "Well, we have used that language. You -- you have not responded to -- to the question where -- where did this language that does appear in our -- in our cases about the relaxed standard, where -- where does that come from?",
  "Apparently only FELA juries cannot understand it; all other juries find it okay.",
  "Your client is entitled to have the jury disregard a proper instruction, right? That's what you're arguing?",
  "Juries disregard instructions on probable cause, on proximate cause. They probably do it in non-FELA cases, too.",
  "But you're entitled to have them disregard the correct instruction rather than an incorrect instruction, right?",
  "So the -- but the question is, what was your argument? What was your side's argument? Did you argue, in effect, proximate cause?",
  "Of course, the other side says that what that meant, and -- and -- and the language of our cases seems to support that, \"in whole or in part\" simply eliminated the common law doctrine of contributory negligence, whereby if the plaintiff also had been negligent, the plaintiff could not recover, and -- and FELA uses a -- a -- a comparative negligence standard.",
  "Why doesn't \"in whole or in part\" apply to the elimination of contributory negligence? Isn't that an adequate explanation for the language?",
  "That's what but-for cause means. Tell me about the snake. Is the snake covered?",
  "Why not?",
  "Once you abandon a proximate cause requirement, however you want to define that, I don't see why the snake isn't covered, or the lightning on 42nd Street.",
  "Sure it did. The train wouldn't have stopped, the conductor wouldn't have gotten off, he wouldn't have been bitten by the snake. If the -- if the car had not traveled to New York over the speed limit, the -- the passenger wouldn't have been on 42nd Street when the lightning struck. I mean, how can you say it didn't play a part? Of course it played a part.",
  "Is that correct?",
  "That negligence didn't play a part?",
  "But for the negligence, the train would not have stopped. How can you say the negligence didn't play a part? Had the train not stopped, he wouldn't have been walking along and been bitten by the snake.",
  "I mean do words mean anything? How can you possibly say that negligence didn't play a part? It obviously did. It seems to me you're arguing for -- not the nonexistence of proximate cause. Nobody in his right mind could argue for the nonexistence of proximate cause. You are arguing for some different -- different definition of proximate cause, and I would like to know what that -- what that new definition is, as opposed to the definition that Mr. Rothfeld proposed.",
  "And you don't assert that that's a foreseeable consequence of the negligence of using a wide-body train?",
  "Well, you -- you don't -­",
  "You say it doesn't have to be foreseeable.",
  "Oh, so you -- you conceded that it ought to be foreseeable.",
  "I'm trying to see what your case is because I can't believe you don't believe in proximate cause. I just think you're -- you're giving a different definition of it, and I'm trying to figure out what your definition of it is.",
  "Do it. I'm still waiting to hear your instruction, which is supposedly something other than \"but for.\" Is it just \"but for\"?",
  "With -- what are the words? Give me the words.",
  "You don't think that's \"but for\"?",
  "I don't care whether I think. We've got words here. What do those words mean?",
  "Negligence is a given; the negligence is not what I'm asking about. I'm asking about causality, and what you have just read is \"but for\" cause.",
  "If the other side doesn't insist on that, the other side -- we'll give you that one.",
  "Well, this jury found it, though. What -- what would you tell the jury?",
  "This jury found it unclear and asks you. What would you say?",
  "You think that eliminates but-for cause, to tell them that negligence plays a part, no matter how small, in the injury? You think that eliminates but-for, rather than invites it?",
  "It sounds like foreseeability you're talking.",
  "I thought you said no foreseeability?",
  "Do you want to go back or forth? Which do you want?",
  "That sounds like a good definition of foreseeable, doesn't it? It's natural and probable.",
  "Could something be natural and probable and not foreseeable?",
  "If that's true, that -­ everything that's natural and probable is foreseeable, but not everything that's foreseeable is natural and probable, you were requesting a jury instruction that didn't go as far to help you as was possible, but you were still requesting a jury instruction that was on the road.",
  "This case go to the jury?",
  "Mr. Maurer, suppose -­ suppose the government imposes a fine of $500 for all political speech, and people nonetheless continue to engage in political speech and pay the $500. Would that make the $500 penalty for political speech constitutional?",
  "Didn't they call it a subsidy in Davis? I -- if I recall the argument, I think that's what -- what it was characterized as there, too. Did they characterize it as a penalty? I doubt it.",
  "I didn't understand the hypothetical. I really didn't.",
  "I assume your opinion can be based upon Buckley, however.",
  "We have the contrary argue here. I'm sure that in some of the public financing cases that we've heard argued, it was asserted that the purpose was to level the playing field, and that that was an entirely valid purpose. I'm unaware that all public financing laws have had as their purpose simply to avoid corruption.",
  "It's very clear, however.",
  "May I ask how it -- how it combats corruption unless it suppresses large contributions -­",
  "-- by certain entities? I mean, I can understand you say, well, it will stop big donors from giving $10 million to somebody's campaign and having that person in his pocket. But that -- that donor is still going to have that -- that senator or whoever it is just as much indebted to him if he gives $10 million, regardless of whether everybody else gets $10 million as well. How does it -- how does it combat corruption unless -- unless the other side is correct that its whole purpose is to suppress the contribution of $10 million, to make it unworthwhile for anybody to give $10 million?",
  "I don't know how you can say that there's no evidence that it's been deterred. Is something true just because you say it? There are in the briefs statistical evidence of how much the population of Arizona has increased and how much less since the enactment of this law the total expenditures have increased. There was testimony in the, in the district court from individuals who said that they withheld their contributions because of this. It's -- it's obvious statistically also that many of the expenditures were made late in the game, where perhaps they were not as effective, in order to be unable to trigger the matching funds in time for the opposing candidate to do anything about it. I do not understand how you can say that there is no evidence. I mean, maybe you might say I do not find the evidence persuasive, but don't tell me there's no evidence.",
  "Ah.",
  "Rhode Island -­",
  "-- has the same expenditures as New York State?",
  "You don't expect the two to have any relationship?",
  "Mr. Jay -- Mr. Jay, do you agree with the -- the assertion of Mr. Phillips that this does not favor incumbents? I would have thought that if I'm an incumbent with name recognition, I would love to be able to not raise any money and just -- just take the public funding, knowing that if worse comes to worse and I have an opponent who does have a lot of independent expenditures for him, I'll be able to get that money free from the State. It seems to me it's very much pro-incumbent rather than anti-incumbent.",
  "Which -- which one should expect campaign finance restrictions to be.",
  "Your answer -- your answer depends upon whether you believe that this scheme will keep the expenditures down, or rather, will elevate the expenditures. And if you believe that it will deter people from making contributions, it will keep the expenditures down.",
  "But anything that, anything that makes it more attractive to take the public financing is okay?",
  "I mean, what if -- what if the State of Arizona says we're not going to give -­ just give money to the other candidates; we're going to send out officers of Arizona to argue on behalf of these other candidates? That would be clearly banned, right?",
  "And would you come in and say, well, it's perfectly okay because its purpose is to make public funding attractive to candidates? The mere fact that it makes it more attractive does not answer the question whether it's constitutional.",
  "I don't -- I'm getting whipsawed here. On the one hand, you say the problem is that they were utterly subjective, and on the other hand you say there is a -- a strong corporate culture that guides all of this. Well, which is it? It's either the individual supervisors are left on their own, or else there is a strong corporate culture that tells them what to do.",
  "Right.",
  "So, there's no discretion; is that what you're saying?",
  "If somebody tells you how to exercise discretion, you don't have discretion.",
  "What do you know about -­ about the unchallenged fact that the central company had a policy, an announced policy, against sex discrimination, so that it wasn't totally subjective at the managerial level? It was, you make these hiring decisions, but you do not make them on the basis of sex. Wasn't that the central policy of the company?",
  "Now, how was -- how was that established?",
  "And that causes them intentionally to discriminate on the basis of sex?",
  "That causes -- how could that possibly cause them to intentionally discriminate on the basis of sex?",
  "That -- that's just an assessment of why the percentage is different. They differ not only at Wal-Mart, but at -- throughout the industry. To say that that's the explanation is not to tell your people: Don't promote women.",
  "If you have an aggressive woman, promote her.",
  "Have you sufficiently shown -- despite the fact of an explicit written central policy of no discrimination against women, do you think you've adequately shown that that policy is a fraud, and that what's really going on is that there is a central -- a central policy that promotes discrimination against women? Do you really think -­",
  "Can I just say something here? Doesn't your class include both those women who were underpaid and both -- and those women who weren't underpaid?",
  "Doesn't your class include both?",
  "Is that commonality?",
  "What -- what -- what -­ what's -- what's your answer assumes is if there is a disparity between the advancement of women and the advancement of men, it can only be attributed to sex discrimination -­",
  "Well, otherwise, how could you say that all -- all of the companies are -- are -­ are presumptively engaging in sex discrimination?",
  "See, I wasn't talking about this case. I was talking about your answer to Justice Alito -­",

  "-- unless there -- you know, there -- there's equality of promotion for men and women.",
  "This -- this takes evidence, to establish that -- that it's more reliable to have a hearing with evidence on the particular promotion or dismissal of the individual, that that is more reliable than using -- I don't care how admirable a statistical guess you make; I mean is that really a question?",
  "We must have a pretty bad judicial system then.",
  "We should use that in jury trials, too, for really old cases. We should just put a statistical model before the jury and say, you know, this stuff is too old; so, we'll -­",

  "In fact it's more than half the class that's gone, isn't it?",
  "But nobody's leaving yet.",

  "Are they all consistent?",
  "What does that have to do with reasonable likelihood that it would occur? I mean, he either intends it or he doesn't intend it. What -­",
  "The realistic likelihood that this person who was killed might have gone to a Federal officer doesn't at all establish that the intent of the person who killed him was to prevent him from going to that officer, does it?",
  "I mean, it seems to me you have to stand on one stool or the other one. Either it -- it relates to intent, as the statute says, or all there has to be is a reasonable likelihood that this person who was killed would have gone to a Federal official.",
  "Which is it?",
  "No, no, that -- that's not what the statute says. It doesn't talk about preventing a future act. It doesn't say anyone who kills someone who would have gone to a Federal official is -- is subject to this penalty.",
  "If that's what it said, your -- your realistic likelihood test would be quite reasonable, but it doesn't say that. It says that the -- the killing has to be with the intent of preventing him from going.",
  "You think a realistic likelihood must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt?",
  "You think a juror can grasp all of that in a juror's mind? You must find that there is -­",
  "-- that there is a realistic likelihood beyond a reasonable doubt?",
  "I would think your answer would be that if that were the law, (a)(1)(C) would have omitted the word \"Federal.\"",
  "It would have said \"by any person to a law enforcement officer.\" And you would -­ you would eliminate \"or judge of the United States\" -­ \"information related to commission or possible commission of a violation of the law,\" period.",
  "Why do you -- why do you need that? I mean, we're always talking here about -­ about murders of a witness, right?",
  "So you're always talking about a murder that was intended to remove somebody who could incriminate the killer -­",
  "-- for some other crime. Why isn't it enough to say you killed that person to prevent the disclosure of the crime, and if the crime was a Federal crime, the disclosure you were preventing was a disclosure to a Federal Court or to a Federal police officer? Why -- why do you have to create a -- a reasonable likelihood that this person, this particular person, would have gone to a Federal officer rather than a State officer? Isn't it enough to kill the person to prevent disclosure of the crime that the crime was a Federal crime? Why isn't that the test?",
  "Oh, the government could more than live with it. The government could wallow in it.",
  "No, but the statute reads it out of the statute. It says in (g) that you don't -­ the intent element does -- does not require that you know it's a Federal officer or that you know it's a Federal judicial proceeding.",
  "Why isn't it enough that you -- you kill somebody to prevent the disclosure of a crime that's a Federal crime?",
  "Isn't it rather strange, trials? It's such a weird issue to submit to the jury in a criminal trial, you know, whether this witness who was -- whether there's a reasonable likelihood that this person who was killed would have gone to a Federal law enforcement authority rather than the State law enforcement authority?",
  "Miss Harrington, we -­ we've gotten along for over 200 years without this particular Federal law, and I, therefore, am not inclined to give it a -- a sweeping broad interpretation, and I think it's so weird to submit to the jury, you know, how likely is it that this dead person would have gone to a Federal law enforcement officer rather than a State law enforcement officer. Why isn't an entirely satisfactory reading of this statute the following, that if you -- if, indeed, you have in mind specifically the FBI or a Federal proceeding, you're done? If, however, you don't have in mind specifically a Federal proceeding, but you have in mind a particular proceeding, which is a Federal proceeding, or a particular officer who is a Federal officer, then you're done, but anything else isn't covered? So the intent has to be the intent to stop a particular proceeding or -- or to stop the person going to a particular officer. If that proceeding is Federal or if the officer is Federal, you have the -- but otherwise, the laws that we've lived under for 210 years will continue to apply, and -- and -- and this new Federal statute will not apply.",
  "I suspect that what this mainly addressed is -- is killing of witnesses, which has become very common in some jurisdictions, witnesses in criminal trials, and you know darn well what trial is involved. It's a trial that's already underway, and if it's a Federal trial and you kill the witness, you're -­ you're liable under this statute. What -- what is covered beyond that is if -­ if you know that the information is going to be given to a Federal officer, then they have you also, but I don't know why we should read the statute any more broadly than that and -- and have these weird questions submitted to the jury how likely was it that this -­ this dead person would have gone to a Federal officer rather than a State officer and -- and inquire into the question that Justice Alito asked, you know, how is there a friendly relationship between State and local officials so that the State official would -- I don't want to get into that. I don't think the juries do.",
  "Understand this, you mean it would have been okay if he went to a Lithuanian movie?",
  "Would -- would you not acknowledge that the statute is vague enough that the intent which it requires could be either the intent to prevent testimony from being given to a particular Federal proceeding or to a particular Federal officer or the specific intent to withhold it from a proceeding or an officer who happens to be or which happens to be Federal, but which the defendant is not aware is Federal? It could bear that meaning, couldn't it?",
  "Oh, I acknowledge that, but a particular judge or -- or the conduct of a Federal proceeding, it could -- it could require specific intent of a proceeding or a judge or an officer which happens to be a Federal officer.",
  "It's unfair for him to ask you what my -- what my hypothetical was. I think the answer is yes.",
  "Would the -- excuse me, Justice. Would the Federally licensed drug manufacturer have a similar obligation to lobby the FDA for a change?",
  "But assume there hadn't been. Assume there hadn't been such a regulation. Do you understand it to be the government's position that the licensed drug manufacturer is not protected from State suits, even though it has a Federal permission to give certain warnings, unless it has lobbied the FDA to change those warnings?",
  "I thought you said you had to tell the FDA about it.",
  "Okay. I didn't understand that.",
  "So you say that if the claim here is simply that you did not disclose properly, that claim could be brought?",
  "To disclose to the FDA.",
  "But you just described Buckman as -- as involving precisely that, failure to tell the FDA the purpose of the screws. You said that the State -- the State suit would lie because of that failure.",
  "Well, they're -- they're -­ they're under the obligation to report to the FDA the facts which establish the grave risk, right?",
  "So the argument here is whether it -- it will be the FDA ultimately that determines whether there was a grave enough risk to modify the -- the label or whether that call will be made by -- by a State court guessing what the FDA would have done, right?",
  "Yeah, but -- but -- no, but -- but surely you have to establish not only that the generic manufacturer requested a label change, but that a label change would have been approved. Otherwise there's no causation. Surely -­",
  "-- that's part of your case, isn't it?",
  "No, but -- but their -­ their preemption claim is we had to give these warnings, and you don't contest that. They had to give the warnings that they gave, unless the FDA said that the warnings must be changed, so -­",
  "-- I mean, I don't see how you can hold them liable, so long as they continued to give the warnings that they had to give.",
  "And they could have lobbied the FDA to say, you know, change the warning, but if the FDA said -- suppose the -- suppose they did tell the FDA, please modify the label, and the FDA said no. Would your lawsuit still proceed?",
  "No.",
  "I would say -­",
  "All right. You're drawing a line between the FDA rejecting a warning and the FDA not accepting the warning; is that the line you're drawing?",
  "Just so I understand what you've said, this 3-month turnaround that you mentioned, they are all requests from labeled manufacturers, right?",
  "I thought you said that generic manufacturers don't make any requests.",
  "Oh, okay.",
  "Oh, I see.",
  "Does a generic manufacturer have to be an expert in the field in which it manufactures?",
  "What does -- what does being an expert mean?",
  "In this context, being an expert means being able to produce exactly the drug that has been approved by the FDA, right? You don't have to be expert in anything else?",
  "What else do they need?",
  "That doesn't make them an expert. I'm talking about what expertise does -- does the company have to -- to possess. It surely has to possess the chemical expertise to produce exactly the product that the -- that the -- that has been approved by the FDA. What other expertise is necessary?",
  "I don't think that'd take any expertise. You have people who complain, I've taken -- I've taken your pill, and it -- it, you know, it's caused -- this is expertise? That's not what I normally think of. Whereas a drug manufacturer does, indeed, require expertise, conducting tests and knowing what changes will produce what results and so forth; right?",
  "Somebody has been appointed in all those cases to sort of carry the flag, right?",
  "Don't they have a distinct obligation to propose labeling changes when they -- when they think they're necessary?",
  "Make it a long sentence, with a lot of \"ands.\"",
  "Well, I assume that the patient's physician has the same opportunity. Anybody could go to the FDA and say this label ought to be changed, right? So the -- the physician taking care of this plaintiff didn't -- had the opportunity to go to the FDA and didn't. Is there a cause of action against him?",
  "I'm not talking about what the -- the FDCA regulation. We're talking about what State law would allow, and State law would allow a suit against the physician because he did not take advantage of the opportunity to go to the FDA and propose a label change.",
  "That would be the -- the prologue -- the prologue to the rule said that, and the rule was never submitted for notice and comment. Is that what you're relying on, that prologue?",
  "How do you decide whether a generic manufacturer ought to have proposed a -- a labeling change?",
  "This is a generic manufacturer. He doesn't know anything about -- about science. He knows how to replicate this pill exactly. That's all -- that's all he really knows. Now, what is the test you're going to impose to -- to a jury to decide whether this generic manufacturer ought to have -- ought to have proposed a labeling change?",
  "Is it -- is it, well, you know, if he had been as well armed scientifically as the original manufacturer of the labeled drug, he should have known or, you know, does this guy who graduated from high school and can replicate a pill, should he have known? What -- what's the -­",
  "Mr. Lefkowitz, do you agree with Justice Ginsburg's characterization of the government's position? I thought the government was saying that there was an obligation on the part of the generics to propose changes.",
  "Otherwise, the government would be saying you have an obligation to lobby, and I don't think they're saying that.",
  "Did you get -- you get (c)(2) at TELRIC rates?",
  "But you -- you want the incumbent here to -- to build the -- the orange cord and extend it to wherever you have your switching equipment. And what they say is, no, you -- you bring your switching equipment here; we'll -- we'll allow you to connect at, you know, the end of our facilities; but, by God, you -- you make -- you make your own connection to -- to the switches. Now -- now, moreover, you're -- you're making them -- you'll pay them for the orange cord, but only at TELRIC rates, which are not realistic. Now, why -- why are they wrong and you're right, especially when you have legislation, the purpose of which was to encourage the independent building of new facilities? I mean, it's clear that the Act wanted these new entrants where -- where possible to build new facilities, and not simply to glom on to the extant facilities of the incumbents.",
  "Well, but the logic of your case, as you described it, would also require AT&T to build out the orange cord.",
  "Excuse me, excuse me.",
  "Extant entrance facilities I assume they were referring to.",
  "Okay. Well --",
  "Right. But if you ask for a longer distance, they would presumably have to build it.",
  "And charge you TELRIC rates.",
  "Mr. Bursch, the -- the key to your case is -- is that an entrance facility is interconnection, right?",
  "You have to equate those two -- those two terms.",
  "What do you rely upon to equate them? Because the -- as I read the regulations, they -- they use them as separate terms.",
  "Doesn't -- doesn't the interconnection -- doesn't it have to be part of the internal system of the incumbent carrier?",
  "What section are you referring to? On page 10a? Which one is it?",
  "You -- you do not need to provide unbundled access under (c)(3) to entrance facilities, right?",
  "It's a genus and -- and the entrance facility is the species --",
  "-- in your estimation?",
  "But there may be a -- a reason to give less weight to briefs in this Court, different from the briefs filed with a court of appeals. And you've taken a different position here on -- on the issue of whether, when backhauling is included, it's part of the -- it's -- it's part of the interconnection facility?",
  "I do not think you made that distinction below about, you know, oh, it is part where there is back -- where there is not backhauling, but where there is, it isn't.",
  "Wait. They have to be as unbundled elements? I thought they never had to be --",
  "-- made available as unbundled elements. That's (c)(3).",
  "Your argument here is that only have to be made available under (c)(2)?",
  "Which is not unbundled?",
  "You certainly encourage us to throw up our hands. There's no doubt about it.",
  "The Sixth Circuit?",
  "What happened to the unbundling rule?",
  "Why was the unbundling rule abandoned?",
  "It's not a bottleneck?",
  "Which is (c)(3).",
  "Excuse me. That's your point, I thought. I thought it is precisely your point that it is (c)(3) rather than (c)(2).",
  "Excuse me. I -- I thought it was conceded that -- that none of this is -- is necessary under (c)(3). I thought that's what the Eighth Circuit said and which is why they eliminated the unbundling obligation under (c)(3).",
  "So, it is accepted by both sides, I think, that this is not necessary.",
  "Do you agree that it has to be needed to interconnect?",
  "The whole problem here is it doesn't have to be needed to interconnect.",
  "It has to be needed under (c)(3), but under (c)(2), it's -- it's up to the -- to the new company to say I want to interconnect here; and -- and the incumbent cannot say, oh, no, you -- you don't have interconnect here; you can interconnect somewhere else.",
  "Like orange wires and such?",
  "In black?",
  "Well, it used to say the other. You -- you contend it used to say the other, and it has never, by proper means, gainsaid its prior position.",
  "I thought they said, moreover, that they were not amending (c)(2), specifically.",
  "The Eighth Circuit's decision would have been unnecessary and the revision of the rule?",
  "Maybe the commission didn't like the Eighth Circuit's decision.",
  "It doesn't say it that happily. It really doesn't.",
  "Well, okay.",
  "Why did they fight the Eighth Circuit litigation? Why did -- I mean, it -- you're telling me it made no difference whether (c)(3) allowed them to do what they wanted to do and what the Eighth Circuit said they couldn't do, right?",
  "Very slightly different. That's not that big a deal.",
  "Incidentally, where do you -- where do you get that backhauling restriction from?",
  "Yes, yes. The --",
  "We'll hear argument now in Case No. 10-290, Microsoft Corporation v. i4i Limited Partnership. Mr. Hungar, you may proceed.",
  "Well, you can't keep shifting horses, now. Are you going to argue for all the time, in which case, you can appeal to the general rule that we always apply, or are you going to say, oh, yes, we won't apply it normally but only when the prior art hadn't been considered? I mean, you -- you can't ride both horses. They're going in different directions.",
  "So, you're contradicting Cardozo?",
  "Mr. Waxman.",
  "Yes, I would like that notion of active acquiescence.",
  "It's like passive activity, right?",
  "Of course the instruction that you've proposed to the jury, like your adversary's proposition, would require determining what it was that the Patent Office considered. So you -- you haven't avoided the -- the -- the problem of litigating an -- an issue that -- that would better be avoided.",
  "You have to do it for your instruction just as -- as he will have to do it for his.",

She would not have been able to refuse it had it been made a condition of her supervised release. You either take the program or you go back to jail.

I'm saying that it's -- it -­ it -- it does not help your case that the reason she did not get the rehabilitative treatment that this judge wanted her to get was that she simply refused it. Why does that help your case? She couldn't have refused it if, as the other side says, had to be the case, he had imposed this rehabilitative measure as a portion of supervised release. Then she would have had to take it.",
  "You haven't read the -- the crucial provision of the statute. Yes, you read the -­ the section entitled imposition of a sentence, but there is another provision in the statute which says imposition of a sentence of imprisonment. You can indeed consider those factors in imposing the sentence, which includes probation, supervised release and any other matters. But what -- what 3582(a) says is that the court in determining whether to impose a -- whether to impose a term of imprisonment as opposed to just parole or -- or supervised release, and if a term of imprisonment is to be imposed and determining the length of term shall consider the factors set forth in, that you mentioned in 3553(a) to the extent they are recognizing that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation. You have to reconcile the two sections. And the way to reconcile them is to say that the former applies to sentencing in general but when you're dealing with the length of a sentence of imprisonment or whether there should be any imprisonment at all, you cannot consider rehabilitation.",
  "I don't know any other way to read it.",
  "I -- I don't know what else recognizing that factor would consist of, except you won't use that factor in deciding imprisonment or length of term of imprisonment.",
  "Well, you tell me what it means here, then. What, he -- he should say, you know, I recognize that rehabilitation is not a -- an appropriate factor to take into account in determining the length of your sentence or the -- or whether you should go to jail at all. That said, I'm going to send you to jail in order to rehabilitate you.",
  "Is that all it means?",
  "But the judge only has the power to impose imprisonment. He does not have the empower to impose anything else during the imprisonment. I mean, what you're saying might make sense if indeed he could prescribe some treatment during imprisonment, but he can't. There are prisons -- and why can't he, by the way? Why has he been prevented from doing that, although he's allowed to do it during supervised release? Does that make any sense, if indeed, as you say, he can take that into account in imprisonment?",
  "If -- if it is as you say, why -- why did Congress leave it up to the Bureau of Prisons to decide whether this person can enter into a rehabilitation program, and not allow the judge to prescribe that the person will enter into it? Why? What -- what possible sense could that make?",
  "Judges can prescribe it?",
  "Well, that's a substantive change, they can't prescribe, right?",
  "I don't understand what you're saying. Was it not a change that the judge could not prescribe a certain program for the prisoner?",
  "It was a change?",
  "Why? Why would they have that change if the statute reads the way you say? What sense does it make to still allow the judge to take this into account, but affirmatively deprive him of the power to do what he wanted to do?",
  "Mr. Keisler, what -- what good does it do you to have this Court say that there is no Article III standing? The suit will just be brought in State court -­",
  "-- under State common law and -- and the States' rules of standing are not ours.",
  "They only need one.",
  "We're not sure about that, are we? So we -- we -- we -- may be just spinning our wheels here.",
  "Indeed, you know, tapping the case to State judges instead of Federal judges, I would frankly rather have Federal judges do it, probably.",
  "Well, the EPA is given authority to regulate other pollutants, including those that do not go up into the atmosphere, but that does not prevent California, for example, from enacting stricter standards for its -- for automobiles in its State.",
  "So why should we say the EPA preempts the Federal common law?",
  "What's your best case?",
  "This is a merits argument, right?",
  "Of course, you're going to have to struggle with the preemption question sooner or later. You're confident you can establish not only displacement of Federal common law, but also preemption of State common law, right?",
  "I'll add a third thing that it goes to and that's Article III standing. It's clear in our cases, if as you say the relief requested here will not remedy the complaint of these people, you don't have to go to prudential standing. That it seems to me would deny Article III standing.",
  "I don't understand why you assert that the remedy here will not provide the relief -- you acknowledge that, don't you, that the remedy here cannot possibly stop global warming, right?",
  "It does? It does? In Massachusetts v. EPA the relief was allowing a Federal agency to regulate the entire society's carbon emissions.",
  "Do you think -- do you think that was the holding of Massachusetts v. EPA, that EPA can only regulate the transportation section?",
  "Is that the holding of the case and -- and do you think the -- the -- the forthcoming EPA rules can only govern transportation?",
  "Of course not. Of course the case covers -­",
  "-- what the EPA could do.",
  "Well, I don't think -­",
  "I don't think that they have to have in mind State law for preemption, either. If indeed the State law just positively conflicts with a Federal statute, it doesn't matter whether Congress had State law in mind, does it? I don't know -­",
  "But you haven't told us how. It -- it -- it's certainly not harder to find because for preemption you require congressional intent, whereas here -- whereas for displacement you don't. That's not the -- that's not the difference. What -­ what is the difference?",
  "You're -- you're lumping them all together. Suppose you lump together all the cows in the country. Would -- would that allow you to sue all those farmers? I mean, don't you have to do it defendant by defendant?",
  "Cow by cow, or at least farm by farm?",
  "So you can lump everybody together, so you can lump together all the people in the United States -­",
  "-- who breathe, I suppose.",
  "All right. All -- all homes -­",
  "-- all homes that -- that emit carbon dioxide in their -- in their heating systems.",
  "The whole country, and you lump them all together, and -­",
  "-- you say that, you know, that equals 10 percent or whatever. Does that give you a basis?",
  "Well, then don't give us a 10 percent figure.",
  "Give us the, you know, the maximum figure for a single one of them.",
  "Implausible -- implausible is the word you're looking for.",
  "I wish Justice Breyer had made this argument in the EPA case. I don't think the EPA case -­",
  "What if the EPA comes up with a different number? Would it -- than the one you achieve in this litigation; would the EPA prevail? Would the EPA's number prevail or your number prevail?",
  "Yes, yes. I mean you -­",
  "And will displace the judgment that has been obtained under Federal law?",
  "Right. And the court says no?",
  "Well, this is just the general purpose behind the exception to 301, right, the -- the exception for providing attorney's advice. The ordinary private litigant doesn't have to show, when he refuses to turn over attorney advice, that there's some conflict which would make it harmful for him to turn that over, does he?",
  "Not in the trustee context. I'm just talking about the normal operation.",
  "And -- and so, once you establish that this isn't the normal trust complex, we apply the normal Rule 301 law, and -- and that does not require the person who declines to turn over the information to show why it would really hurt him to turn it over, right?",
  "Has it ever been applied, to your knowledge, where -- where it was not the case that the trust paid for the attorney's advice out of the trust funds and where the trust did -- where -- where the trust owned the papers that consisted of the attorney's advice? Is there any case where those two conditions or either one of them did not exist where the -- the trust was required to turn over the attorney's advice?",
  "Yes, but, see, that's the argument of the government, that the exception, the trust exception to the extent that it exists, was based principally upon the fact that these papers belonged to the trust and that the attorney's advice had been paid for by the trust, so of course the trustee is entitled to get it.",
  "But you don't have a single case?",
  "No. Why can't the trustee say: I'm going to hire my own lawyer? I'm not going to pay this lawyer out of trust funds, so it will be my lawyer, and his advice is only to me and serving my interests? Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't that suffice?",
  "The trustee cannot hire his own lawyer, you're saying. So long as he's a trustee, he cannot hire his own lawyer to get advice on how to manage the trust in a way that will avoid his liability. He just can't do it, right? Trustees can't -­",
  "Again, as the Chief Justice pointed out, that seems to me an artificial distinction. What I ask from -- for from the attorney is advice as to how I can manage the trust so as to avoid liability. I mean, the -- the two are connected. You can't separate out advice as to how to manage, how to manage the trust from advice as to how to avoid liability. In the -- in the context of asking, of a trustee's asking advice, the two are the same.",
  "Did it do -- did it do on that basis, retrospective versus prospective?",
  "We're not talking here about competing interests. I mean, the example you give of -- of the life beneficiary and the remainderman, those are interests of the beneficiaries that conflict.",
  "We're talking here about an interest of the trustee that conflicts with what he is supposed to do, with respect to the person who is the beneficiary of the trust. That -- that's a totally different situation.",
  "And ordinarily if there is that kind of a conflict where the trustee has a personal conflict, he has to step down as trustee. You can't continue to be trustee when you -- your own financial interests, for example, are against the financial interests of the beneficiary; right?",
  "That's what the government asserts: I have other duties as government besides my duties to the -- to these Indians.",
  "And sometimes those duties conflict with my duties to the Indians.",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Boies, you talked about loss causation. The Respondents assert that that's not what the Fifth Circuit was really doing, that -- that really they're just trying to rebut the presumption essentially of -- of Basic by -- by showing that at the -- at the far end, there was -- there was nothing that could justify the presumption. Would you be satisfied if we just said that we agree with you that the requirement to prove loss causation is -- is no good, and sent it back to the Fifth Circuit and then let the Fifth Circuit adopt the theory that Respondents assert they have already adopted? I mean, it's sort of a Pyrrhic victory, it seems to me, if you haven't just disapproved loss causation.",
  "Well, they -- they would construe it the way Respondents say they have already construed it.",
  "I think what you've said is that there's really no difference between loss causation and what Respondents assert that the Fifth Circuit found.",
  "Right.",
  "Okay, but -- but you -- you would want us to say that and not just say that loss causation -­",
  "But you acknowledged that if the cause was the fact that the market was not efficient, that could be raised at the certification stage.",
  "Can you -- can you do this in reverse? I mean, suppose the class comes in and, instead of proving at the outset that the market's an efficient market and allege a misrepresentation, they come in at the back end and they say: When that statement that we assert was a misrepresentation was corrected, the price of stock went down and we lost money. Now, it seems to me you would have to argue, well, that's a good allegation if it's an efficient market, which is a common question, right?",
  "So they can certify under Rule 23 by using the back end. Instead of proving the efficient market, they can prove that there was a statement correcting the alleged misrepresentation, the price of stock went down, right, and they can certify the class?",
  "Why not? It would be -- it would be a common question whether the market's efficient or not.",
  "They're not relying on that assumption. They -- they come in and show that there was a correction of what we alleged was a misstatement and the market went down. That's all that they allege. And of course, that proves anything only if there's an efficient market. But that will be a common question to the whole class, so we'll, we'll -- we'll save that for later.",
  "Well, but they assert that. They assert that the reason it went down was because of the initial misstatement.",
  "I understand that. I'm just saying that seems to me it's a crazy way to run a railroad.",
  "If you can allege what's upfront, you can allege what's -- what's in the back, and what's upfront becomes a common question, so you certify the whole class.",
  "But -- but why do you -­",
  "Which means you would lose. I -- I mean, which means that the plaintiff would lose. But it doesn't mean that there is not a common issue, that the -- that the latter question, whether in fact the market was affected or not is, is not a common question. Rule 23 only requires that -- that there be a common question.",
  "I thought that the whole reason you -- you say that the class certification stage is so significant is precisely because once the class is certified, there will be immense discovery on the merits of the case, which will be so expensive for defendants that they're inclined to throw in the towel. Now you're telling us that you -- you want to move discovery up to the class certification stage?",
  "I -- I -- I'm sure it wasn't your point, but -­",
  "Why is -- why is -- why is the present tense inadequate for the -- for the government's position in this case? Once it is conceded that the North Carolina law is not retroactive, the law reducing the number of years, it is the case that what is the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense that he committed -- how many years ago was it, whatever -­",
  "What is the maximum punishment for that offense which occurred at that time is the longer period. Why is -- I don't see why your argument requires us to ask what would be the term if he had committed the offense at a later date. The maximum term for his offense when he committed it is those years because the State did not retroactively reduce his sentence.",
  "It's not just for the defendant; it's for anybody who committed it prior to the -- prior to the amendment of the statute.",
  "Anybody that committed it then, the -- the -- it is an offense \"involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute a controlled...for which a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more is prescribed by law.\" It is prescribed by law for any of those offenses that occurred between whenever that old statute was enacted and whenever this statute was enacted.",
  "Excuse me. That's -­",
  "That's correct? You're happy with that? The person committed a felony when it was a felony, and the State later no longer makes it a felony, and it isn't counted for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act?",
  "Are we looking at it because we want the States to determine the Federal sentence or are we looking at it because we evaluate the evil of the particular defendant on the basis of how -­ how much of a crime he was willing to commit? And so long as it was a serious felony when he committed it, this is a bad actor. I don't care if the State changes its view. At the time, he was willing to commit a felony that put him in jail for 10 years, and that's what we're looking to, it seems to me, how bad an apple is this fellow that -- that we're talking about putting away? And that doesn't change simply because the State decides in the future that that same act will not be a felony. Well, people who perform that act in the future aren't so bad; they're just -- you know, just normal not-so-good people -­",
  "-- but they're not the kind of a person who's willing to -- to commit a felony that, you know, puts them away for 10 years. It seems to me that that's what the Federal law is looking to. We're not giving over to the States the decision of -- of how long we should incarcerate somebody in a Federal prison.",
  "I agree, it does refer to the seriousness of the offense. But it refers to the seriousness of the offense at the time the offense was committed in order to determine how bad a fellow this is, not -- not because we want the States to determine how long we're going to keep Federal prisoners in prison.",
  "That's the issue, though, really.",
  "But you'll -- you'll put away for a long time somebody who really wasn't that bad a guy. He committed a misdemeanor, and when the State later makes it a felony, you -- he suddenly comes under ACCA. And I -- I can't believe that that's -- that's what -- what Congress had in mind just because the State now thinks that it's more serious. Who cares what the State thinks? We -- we want to know how bad an actor this particular defendant is.",
  "I'm not sure it's so hard. I -- I could find my way clear to saying that if it has been retroactively made a -- a -- a lesser offense, that that would qualify under -- under the statute. I don't know why you insist that his actual conviction be -- be altered.",
  "But they could use it for other purposes, right?",
  "Right.",
  "So what the Chief Justice suggested is right, that the purpose is to stop them from using it in order to market their drugs?",
  "That's right.",
  "Well, that's right, but that -- that is an impediment to their using it for the marketing of drugs. You're -- you're placing that impediment on it. Isn't that the obvious purpose of it? I mean, it doesn't necessarily make it bad, but -- but let's not quibble over what the purpose is.",
  "That's the purpose. That's the purpose of it, to prevent them from using this information to market their drugs.",
  "But it's only for that use that you interpose the requirement that the doctor consent. For all other uses you don't require the doctor's consent, right?",
  "So -- so the data is not private in the sense that the physician who prescribes knows that nobody will know what he is prescribing and how much he prescribes and how often, because there are a lot of people who do know that, right?",
  "So the only thing it assures the physician, the physician who prescribes, is that he won't be bothered by drug companies who, on the basis of their knowledge of information which other people have, approach him in order to market their drugs? That's basically all it assures the prescribing physician, right?",
  "And, and he could achieve the same objective, could he not, by simply refusing to talk to the marketer. When the marketer says, you know, I want to talk to you about a new drug, he says: I don't talk to drug manufacturers and marketers.",
  "How does it increase the prescribing physician's right of privacy that the data about his prescribing can only be given away but can't be sold? Does that make him feel happier about his privacy?",
  "He can do that by saying: I don't want to talk to you.",
  "That may well be, but then just don't tell me that the purpose is to protect their privacy. Now you're arguing a totally different purpose: It makes it easier for the physician to cut off approaches by drug companies that want to sell drugs. If that's the purpose of this statute, it's quite different from protecting his privacy. His privacy isn't protected by saying you can't sell it but you can give it away.",
  "The information necessary for effective speech is what you're saying, right?",
  "It only restricts the information necessary for really effective speech?",
  "They're looking for it because it -- it identifies those doctors that they would like to approach with their information which may say, you know, our product is much better than the generic; our quality control is -- you know, whatever. There are arguments on both sides of those things. And you are making it more difficult for them to speak by restricting access to information that would enable their speech to be most effective.",
  "Well, that's an important position. If you -- if that indeed was the meaning of the statute, you should have told the court of appeals, don't you think? Is it enough to say we didn't say no? You should have said yes. You should have said this is what it means.",
  "But it doesn't protect his privacy. I mean, the -- his name and -- and the extent of his prescriptions can be given away for a lot of uses. It doesn't protect his privacy.",
  "It protect -- it enables him to protect himself against drug companies that want to talk to him.",
  "All right, so long as I know that's what you're talking about. When you say \"privacy,\" you don't mean the prescriber's concern that people will know that he prescribed certain drugs. He doesn't care about that, right.",
  "That is not protected by this law.",
  "It's not protected by this law.",
  "I'm talking about what this law protects. It does not protect his privacy in that sense. It protects his privacy in the sense that it enables him to avoid having to say go away when a salesman for the -- for the -- for the drug company comes, right?",
  "You mean it doesn't even protect his privacy in the sense that it enables him not to have to say go away. It doesn't even protect that. They -- he -- he will still have to say that -­",
  "-- if the drug company approaches him without having this information.",
  "All right.",
  "Can the State enact a law that, say, petition signers cannot approach somebody unless he has given his prior consent?",
  "Of course not.",
  "Doctors can do that if they don't want to talk to the -­",
  "I don't take \"biased\" to mean false. \"Biased\" means one-sided.",
  "You state the true facts only on one side and not the other.",
  "This case has not been argued as a case restricting false advertising, has it?",
  "Mr. Elwood, for me at least we've -- we've jumped way ahead. I'm not so much concerned about the vagueness as I am about the proposition that ethical rules adopted by legislatures for voting are subject to review by this Court or by any court under the First Amendment. This is the first case I'm aware of that we've ever had which makes such an allegation or -- I'm not even aware of any other case in 220 years in Federal courts. And it's certainly not because legislative rules have not been vague. The first Congress adopted a rule that, quote, \"No member shall vote on any question in the event of which he is immediately and particularly interested.\" I don't consider that very precise. And the rules adopted by Thomas Jefferson for the Senate, \"Where the private interests of a member are concerned in a bill or question, he is to withdraw.\" \"The private interests,\" what does that mean? \"And where such an interest has appeared, his voice is disallowed, even after a division.\" Now, that's been around in our Congress forever, but our Constitution provides that -- that the rules of the legislature are to be determined by Congress and not by this Court, and I am sure we would not, we would not review those rules. Now, is there a contradiction between leaving those rules to Congress and the First Amendment? Do you really think that -­ that the two are set in opposition to each other?",
  "You're ending up skirmishing on what seems to me a less significant aspect of this case. This case is enormously important on that major question. I'm not inclined to resolve it on the question, well, you know, this is too vague. I mean, it's even vaguer than what the first Congress adopted. It seems to me that just opens, opens the door to future litigation challenging ethical rules, which -­ which does not make me happy.",
  "Well, and if they did we would review it.",
  "Isn't that nice. But the cases come up here anyway, right?",
  "Look, fighting words are words. They are speech. There's no doubt that they're speech. And it's a considerable question whether the vote of a legislature is speech for purposes of the first -- is speech at all, not whether it's a fighting speech or something else, whether it's speech. It's a vote.",
  "You may be willing to, but I'm not.",
  "Mr. Elwood, why is that extraordinary? Why aren't you willing to accept that? I mean, if -- if the Speaker of the House counts the votes wrong and he says the ayes have it when it's obvious that the ayes don't have it, do we review that?",
  "Is there any greater violation of the principles of democracy than counting the votes wrong in the legislature? Yet that matter is not reviewable here, is it?",
  "So why is it extraordinary that this one should not be reviewable?",
  "Mr. Carrigan -- if -- if we did not review any of these ethical rules applicable to a legislature, at least where the rule is adopted by the legislative body itself, as -- as opposed to being imposed upon it by -- by some other body, there is the protection that all of the legislators are subject to it. So if it's vague for Mr. Carrigan in this case, it's vague for everybody else as well.",
  "And so it's sort of a self-regulating mechanism. You -­",
  "You have to be willing to abide by whatever -- whatever vagueness and whatever ethical rules you -- you have opposed -- imposed on somebody else.",
  "So does this.",
  "Mr. Rosenkranz, is -- is the vote of a judge in a case like the vote of a legislator? Is -- is that speech? Because judges are subject to ethical rules which -- which prohibit their participating if there would be, quote, \"an appearance of impropriety.\" If there's anything vaguer than that I can't imagine what it might be. Can I get out of all that stuff?",
  "Are you answering my question? I want to know whether I can get out of this appearance of impropriety stuff.",
  "Why?",
  "What does that have to do with whether the First Amendment applies, with all of its prohibitions against vagueness?",
  "That's too bad, because I would have been much more attracted to your position.",
  "That's rather exaggerated. I mean, you have to worry he's going to buy a casino or -- or something like that? I mean -­",
  "If that's what it means, you would think the legislature would change it, wouldn't you?",
  "I mean, it doesn't just hurt Mr. Carrigan. That -- you know, that -- that would be something every legislator would -- would worry about and say, oh, boy, we've got to change this.",
  "So why don't we let them change it?",
  "Excuse me. You spoke of that, Justice Ginsburg's question, as though it was a hypothetical. But that could happen, couldn't it? What if one of these Respondents charged more than the State law permits? Wouldn't -- wouldn't the State move against them?",
  "So, all they have to do, as far as the Government is concerned, is amend their complaint to say: We intend to charge higher rates than the State law allows.",
  "And then you -- you'd agree that the suit would lie.",
  "Well, gee, we're not deciding a whole lot here, then. Just -- it's just a matter of pleading that we're deciding, right?",
  "You -- you do not even exclude all Spending Clause cases. You only exclude those Spending Clause cases where -- where the plaintiff does not say we are -- you know, we're going to violate the State law, and they're going to come after us. So, you haven't made an exception for the Spending Clause.",
  "That -- that's not --",
  "That's not the theory on which we've said you can't get damages under Ex parte Young. The theory that prevents damages is the theory of sovereign immunity. The -- the fiction that you're -- that you're moving against the individual and not against the State simply cannot be maintained when you're taking money out of the State treasury. That's the basis for it, not -- not what you just described.",
  "You've lost me here. You -- you say there would be a cause of action under the Supremacy Clause if the agency approves the rates, but your clients don't think the rates are high enough?",
  "Under the --",
  "Well, Federal law is determined by the agency, surely. So long as the agency is complying with the Administrative Procedure Act, I don't see how you have any --",
  "-- any cause of action under the Supremacy Clause; you may have an APA cause of action.",
  "Federal law is not determined by the agency?",
  "Federal law is not determined by the agency?",
  "Well, then you don't have a Supremacy Clause cause of action.",
  "Well, I -- you know, my problem is that's very strange. I find it very strange to leave it up to the Attorney General whether something will be a crime or not. It will be a crime if the Attorney General says so, and it won't be a crime if he doesn't. I mean, especially leave it up to the Attorney General, for Pete's sake; he's the prosecutor. You know, it will be a crime if the prosecutor thinks it is, and it won't be a crime if the prosecutor thinks it isn't. I don't -- I don't know of any parallel, and -­ and I -- I think it's sailing close to the edge of unconstitutionality; whereas, what the other side claims is simply it's a crime to begin with, but the Attorney General can make it not a crime. That -- that's sort of like prosecutorial discretion. In -- in his -- in his judgment, if it shouldn't be a crime, you know -- I have trouble with that, too. But it's a lot -­",
  "But it's a lot closer to prosecutorial discretion than -- than what you're asking us to accept, that something is a crime only if the Attorney General says it's a crime. That seems to me very strange.",
  "And your argument is further that without the rule, SORNA doesn't exist, right?",
  "Right.",
  "Post- what?",
  "Well, we had a case involving the meaning of \"modify,\" and it doesn't -­ doesn't mean \"repeal.\" So, he presumably couldn't suspend the whole thing.",
  "It authorized the FCC to modify the requirement to post rates, and the FCC simply eliminated the requirement to post rates, and we said that that was no good.",
  "Where is this? Do you want to tell us where it is?",
  "It's very helpful to know what you're talking about.",
  "Of course, it would strengthen your case if you would at least acknowledge that it would be constitutionally doubtful. You wouldn't have to say it's bad, but if you said it's doubtful -­",
  "-- it would strengthen your case, wouldn't it?",
  "What if the State doesn't, but the Federal government does? I mean, what if you say, you know, there's no State habeas available; you go straight to Federal habeas?",
  "So you haven't really given us a solution for the States. They can't -- they can't stop this thing. Right?",
  "But what - -",
  "What about other claims that -- that don't follow on? I mean, other -- other claimed errors in the trial. You say the State doesn't have to pay for that representation. Does counsel keep time sheets on - -",
  "-- on the various issues, 12-minute intervals?",
  "And the State pays for some issues and not for other issues?",
  "Well, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel certainly can't be dealt with on direct appeal, right?",
  "So, even if you get a different counsel to -- to take the appeal - -",
  "-- you could always claim that that counsel was ineffective in habeas, right?",
  "Is that involved in this case?",
  "Do we have to decide this for this case?",
  "It's another case. It's - -",
  "There seems to be a rational line between collateral attack and attack in the same proceeding. I don't see anything irrational about that. Right?",
  "Yes!",
  "Who says so? Who says so? Who says that they rely on -- you have a local attorney, and you have to have a local attorney for the case, don't you? And -- and you want us to believe that the local attorney is -- has no responsibility for the case at all? Is this really what the -- what the law requires? I -- I think there is a serious ethical obligation when he has the -- when he gets the notice. He is one of the attorneys for your client. And he got the notice, right? That one was not returned.",
  "He failed to check with -- with the New York lawyers who were working with him. Why is it -- why is the State responsible for that?",
  "But, you know, even if local counsel is as you -- as you describe it, and nothing in the record establishes it, even if he is a functionary, surely the function would include when he gets a notice, that he makes sure that the -- the people who do the real work know about the notice.",
  "He didn't perform that function.",
  "To whom did he make that clear? You said he made it clear at the outset. To whom? And where is that in the record?",
  "His affidavit after -- after the fact, right?",
  "Did -- did he tell the clerk of the court that that was the case?",
  "Yes, you know, I'm counsel of record. He's the counsel of record, right? I'm counsel of record, but I don't even do so much as to forward notices to the guys that are doing the real work? Did he tell the clerk that?",
  "That's extraordinary.",
  "Where does the Constitution say, by the way, that you have to give notice, that every judicial action has to be noticed --",
  "-- to the parties to the case? The Federal rules don't -- don't require notice, do they?",
  "And the Federal rules don't say it. You don't have to give notice in the Federal rules, do you?",
  "Capital cases are different? If you're going to go to jail for life you -- you don't get notice, but if -- if it's a capital case --",
  "No, I mean, it's either a rule for all criminal cases or it's not a rule.",
  "And if -- if it's a rule for all criminal cases, the Federal rules are unconstitutional, you're saying.",
  "Once you're in court and you have a lawyer, it's up to your lawyer to follow what goes on in the court. That's the assumption of the Federal rules. And it seems to me a perfectly reasonable assumption. And I'm not about to hold that -- that they are unconstitutional simply because an extraordinary requirement of notice, which is not required by the Constitution, has gone awry.",
  "He can't define his role as a lawyer. Once he appears before a court and says, I am counsel of record, he has certain responsibilities. It's not up to him to say what his responsibilities are.",
  "And if they don't extend even to forwarding notice, even to making sure that the people who were doing the legwork in the case know that -- that the clock is running, my goodness, I can't imagine what his responsibility is. It's not up to him to define it.",
  "Do we know that he knew all of those facts?",
  "Of course, we don't know that.",
  "Mr. Garre, can I go back to Justice Kennedy's question? This was not an appeal. The question was how many capital cases is there no appeal. He had been convicted and had appealed, right? The -- this is --",
  "The direct proceedings were over. He had appealed up to -- up to the State supreme court. Did he seek cert here, too?",
  "He did. And this was a postconviction --",
  "That may be, but I don't think it's extraordinary that there be no appeal, I mean, postconviction.",
  "It can be allowed, but it would not seem to me extraordinary that it not be sought.",
  "What -- what is the line, Mr. Garre, between abandonment and just plain old negligence?",
  "So, if this local counsel simply goofed in not -- not advising the people that were doing the legwork in the case, why -- why is that abandonment?",
  "But it seems to me it's up to you to produce the facts that would justify our reversing the case that you're asking us to do.",
  "And you say, well, we don't have these facts; well, send -- send it back so I can -- no, you should have gotten the facts in the first place. If the record doesn't show the things that you need to show to get this case reversed, the case should not be reversed, it seems to me.",
  "When did you first make the abandonment claim?",
  "When was it? Wasn't it first made in the -- in the request for rehearing?",
  "That's rather late.",
  "That isn't abandonment. That isn't abandonment. The attorneys' actions established cause; that does not mean abandonment to me.",
  "What does the return mean when you get -- get a notice returned? It just said no longer at Sullivan & Cromwell, is what the two of them said, right?",
  "Does that necessarily mean that they've abandoned the case? It just means you got the wrong address, doesn't it?",
  "Isn't that the only thing it means for sure, these lawyers are no longer here at Sullivan & Cromwell?",
  "I don't know how that would be an indication of abandonment. Can't you switch a law firm and keep the client?",
  "Of course, he didn't have to send the letter. That letter had no legal effect, did it?",
  "I mean, it was just: By the way, your time has expired. I mean, this is not -- what could the lawyer do about it?",
  "It wasn't a required notice that he had to give to the lawyer or to anybody else.",
  "So he just made this extraneous, volunteered statement to Maples instead of to his lawyer. I don't -- I don't know what that proves.",
  "Well, the argument is that on the record or not is determinative for the out-of- town counsel, but it is not determinative for the in-town counsel. The fact that he is counsel of record doesn't count, but the fact that those two are does count. And only when you combine those two does the man have no counsel. Right?",
  "Well, as then the clerk has to believe that it's an important letter. Right? It's not important enough to be required by the Federal rules. How important is it?",
  "Well, even --",
  "Even if you assume that he had figured it out, that -- you would have to impute his knowledge to the clerk of court to -- to find the -- the fault on the part of the State that's alleged here.",
  "Did he tell the clerk of court that he was only going to send it to Maples?",
  "Mr. Neiman, am I correct that under the Alabama rules when an attorney is represented by more than one attorney, the notice does not have to go to all of them?",
  "It can only go to one, right?",
  "So, as far as local counsel knew, he was the only one to receive notice of this thing, right?",
  "If we find --",
  "If we find that these lawyers did abandon their client, will there be some sanction imposed upon them by the bar? I often wonder, just as when we find that there's been inadequate assistance of counsel in a capital case, does -- does anything happen to the counsel who have been inadequate in a capital case?",
  "Have you ever heard of anything happening to them? Other than they're getting another capital case?",
  "We don't have to adopt the State's position that he was not abandoned. We have to adopt your position that he was abandoned.",
  "Well, it certainly -- it certainly doesn't mean he can leave the prison, right?",
  "That's clear, but -- but isn't that the only difference? It, certainly, at a minimum, means that he can leave this interrogation.",
  "But what could it possibly mean if it didn't mean you could leave this room where you're now being questioned?",
  "Wait a minute. Who have or have not transferred to any other person. So, you don't have to have a copyright.",
  "Right?",
  "Read it again. Who have --",
  "-- or have not transferred to any other person.",
  "Oh. Oh, the copyright. I got you.",
  "Would you -- would you spend a little bit of time on your other argument? I take it to be a separate argument apart from the, you know, time limit argument, the argument that the problem here is that this law does not promote the progress of science and useful arts and, therefore, does not comply with the Copyright Clause. Why doesn't it --",
  "Why doesn't it promote the progress of science and the useful arts?",
  "Let me put it -- I think it's the same point -- another way. Let's assume I'm a multibillionaire, and I receive an award as a great patron of the arts because I have furthered the arts by giving several million dollars to someone who has already composed an opera or who has already written a book. Wouldn't -- wouldn't I be furthering, be viewed as furthering, the arts?",
  "But that's what the copyright law permits, the -- excluding things from the public domain so long as, in the process of doing it, you're furthering the arts.",
  "Of course, the assumption of this -- of this line of questioning, I suppose, is that the mere marketing in the United States of stuff that has already been created promotes the progress of the useful arts. I'm not sure it promotes the progress of the useful arts. It makes more money for the guy who wrote it, but it doesn't incentivize anybody --",
  "-- to create art.",
  "General Verrilli, I do not find that an appealing argument. It seems to me Congress either had the power to do this under the Copyright Clause or it didn't. I don't think that powers that Congress does not have under the Constitution can be acquired by simply obtaining the agreement of the Senate, the President, and Zimbabwe.",
  "I do not think a treaty can expand the powers of the Federal Government. I mean, this is either okay under the copyright clause or it isn't. Now --",
  "-- it would be nice to know the reason for it, but you would still have to establish that it's within the power of the Federal Government --",
  "Okay.",
  "I think your point is that it's -- it's none of the business of the government to decide what the substantial interest of the church is.",
  "Can we try whether it's a sham? I thought you said we couldn't try whether it's a sham.",
  "Is a sham different from a pretext?",
  "So, you would allow the - - the government courts to probe behind the church's assertion that this person is a minister? You would allow that, right? But once it is determined that the person is a minister, you would not allow the government to decide whether the firing was a pretext?",
  "And that term is a legal term. What constitutes a minister is -- is decided by the law, not by the church, right?",
  "Okay.",
  "What makes it not true? What is the legal definition of \"minister\"? What is it? That you have to lead the congregation in their religious services or what? What is it?",
  "Okay, but this is -- you're saying a fortiori, but basically you'd be here anyway even if she hadn't been ordained; right?",
  "Okay.",
  "That's extraordinary.",
  "That's extraordinary.",
  "We're talking here about the Free Exercise Clause and about the Establishment Clause, and you say they have no special application to - -",
  "There's nothing in the Constitution that explicitly prohibits the government from mucking around in a labor organization. Now, yes, you -- you can by an extension of First Amendment rights derive such a -- but there, black on white in the text of the Constitution are special protections for religion. And you say that makes no difference?",
  "I think that the balancing of interests is different, according to the Petitioner, when one of the interests is religion. And you're just denying that. You say: We balance religion the way we balance labor organizations.",
  "That's certainly not what the Petitioner is saying.",
  "Even with respect to their religion classes and their theology classes? It's extraordinary.",
  "Just because -- just because you have to comply with State education requirements on secular subjects, your -- who you pick to -- to teach theology or to teach religion has to be -- has to be subject to State control?",
  "I don't think they merge at all. Smith didn't involve employment by a church. It had nothing to do with who the church could employ. I don't -- I don't see how that has any relevance to this. I would -- I didn't understand your answer to the Chief Justice's question. You -- you say that there were different institutional values or government values involved with respect to a -- to a Catholic priest than there is with respect to this Lutheran minister. Let's assume that a Catholic priest is -- is removed from his duties because he married, okay? And -- and he claims: No, that's not the real reason; the real reason is because I threatened to sue the church. Okay? So, that reason is just pretextual. Would you -- would you allow the government to go -- go into the -- into the dismissal of the Catholic priest to see whether indeed it -- it was pretextual?",
  "Why?",
  "Why is that any different from the Lutheran minister?",
  "I think that's saying nothing different than what the Chief Justice suggests, that you think the one is more -- is more important to -- to Catholics than the other is to Lutherans.",
  "It's only a bad approach if we adopt your test. Why isn't it a perfectly reasonable test whether the person -- although the person may have a lot of secular duties, whether the person has substantial religious responsibilities?",
  "But it's not paramount. Would you -- take the firing of the Catholic priest example. Does that get into the courts?",
  "Why not?",
  "But he can sue for money, right?",
  "Not reinstated. He can sue for money. He can sue for, you know, the loss of - -",
  "Gee whiz. Do -- do Lutheran schools and Catholic parochial schools share public funds the same way public schools do?",
  "You bet you they don't.",
  "What is this argument you're making? I don't understand.",
  "Don't tell me that fair is fair, that now, you know - -",
  "-- we're just like everybody else. That's not true.",
  "Might not the Establishment Clause have something to do with that question - -",
  "-- which applies to institutions?",
  "Whereas the Free Exercise Clause applies to individuals, right?",
  "Give me an example of a - - of an injury that occurs on the shelf that is not a consequence of operations conducted. What -- just beachcombers out there, or what?",
  "What are they doing out there?",
  "Mr. Clement, I don't really understand proximate cause as applied to a -- a statute that provides for automatic liability rather than liability for negligence. To say that it's a proximate cause of a particular act of negligence is one thing, and we have a whole body of law that gives guidance for that. But do you know of any other situation where we talk of proximate cause, something proximately caused by operations? Not by a particular act of negligence or - - I don't know how to apply proximate cause to an operation.",
  "What reason did they have to use the terminology \"as a result of\" instead of simply saying that this Act applies only with regard to injuries on the platform, which is what other statutes did say? I mean, other statutes had a geographical requirement. What a strange way to say it, \"as a result of operations.\"",
  "The trouble with that is that's not what it says. It says \"as a result of operations.\"",
  "And I don't -- you know, I would think he doesn't even have to be an employee, does he?",
  "What is the backup position that's so much better here? What is it?",
  "Yes, but --but Mr. Clement says that -- and we can argue about whether the language does it or not, but the system he comes up with, he says, creates a very sensible division. You're either under the Longshore Act or you're under this Act. And -- whereas, in your situation, you can be under both, can't you?",
  "Well, why does that make any sense?",
  "Which one prevails when they both apply? Are there any differences between the two?",
  "When you're covered by both the Longshore Act and State workmens' comp, can you proceed under either one?",
  "You can't get - -",
  "But you think you can proceed under the State law if you choose.",
  "I don't think that's an anomaly. I mean, you know, if it's a floating platform, it's a vessel. The difference between a vessel and a dock. Is it an anomaly that you're covered under the Longshore Act if you're injured on a dock, which is fixed, but you are not -- you're covered under the Jones Act instead if you're on a vessel, which is not fixed?",
  "That doesn't seem to me like an anomaly at all.",
  "How many floating platforms are there, anyway?",
  "And they're covered by the Jones Act?",
  "They should be; they're vessels.",
  "You're -- you are not proposing to eliminate that anomaly?",
  "You're saying wherever you are injured, so long as you're on a platform, you're covered. I don't think so.",
  "So, you still have an anomaly.",
  "Sometimes it will be covered; sometimes it won't be covered.",
  "So, if you work only 20 percent of your time for this -- this drilling company on -- on the -- on the platform, but it so happens that you are injured on the platform, you know, a bolt comes off and strikes you, you're not covered?",
  "Well, then -- then you're not applying the -- the employment test. I mean, you either are or you are not.",
  "Heads, I win; tails, you lose, right? We -- we have a situs-of-the-injury test when you have less than your -- a majority of your work on the platform, but we don't have a situs test when the majority is on the platform.",
  "How do you get that out of this statute?",
  "Was it the Longshore Act? I thought -- I thought it was the Jones Act that they were covered in the helicopter.",
  "I assume that the Act would also apply under your analysis to a -- an independent contractor, a trucker, who carries this heavy -- this heavy steel to the place where this worker worked on it, right?",
  "Well - -",
  "-- but he would not have been carrying the steel had it not been for the -- for the operations on the shelf.",
  "I see. I see.",
  "He would be covered if - - if -- he were employed by the -- by the firm that operates the platform, right?",
  "Well -- it's just the guy that drives the truck that takes the steel to the place where your client worked on it.",
  "Yes, the decision -- what decision did the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania make other than the decision not to hear the case?",
  "Right. And -- and you don't need a magic word, but it seems to me you need something more than a provision dealing with what you have to tell to the people who -- who accept these contracts. I mean it's not in the substantive part of the statute. It's in the part of the statute that tells you what provisions of the -- of the Act you have to notify the consumer of. It's a very strange way for Congress to say \"no arbitration\" by putting this language in a section that has nothing to do with the rights under the Act.",
  "It is intended to be a summary of the rights under the Act.",
  "Do you think that Gilmer would have come out differently with regard to one of the procedural rights involved in that case if the statute had happened to refer to that procedural right as a right? Procedural rights are rights, aren't they?",
  "So, and if the statute in Gilmer had referred to one of the procedural rights in passing as a right, you think that one would have been non-waivable?",
  "But procedural rights are rights. I mean, to denominate it as a right is - -",
  "Exactly.",
  "Yes, but - -",
  "But you're saying -- in answer to my question, you're saying that just because the statute refers to procedural rights as rights, just as we do, all of a sudden, simply because the statute uses our normal language, those procedural rights are elevated to the level of substantive rights and can't be waived. That can't be right.",
  "I don't think that referring to a procedural right as a right creates any inference at all. It is a right.",
  "Well -- well, I guess it goes further than that, your argument does, it seems to me. Your argument is the waiver -- the non-waiver of rights provision would normally be read to mean non-waiver of substantive rights, but the notice given to the consumer here, which refers to the procedural right to sue as a \"right,\" eliminates that presumption. So, I presume, therefore, that your position is that all procedural rights under this statute cannot be waived. Because, I mean, that's what we're talking about: What does \"right\" mean - -",
  "-- when it says rights are not waived? And our prior case law says ordinarily that means only substantive rights. But here in this statute, it refers to the right to sue, which is certainly a procedural right, as a right. So, I presume all the other procedural rights in this statute likewise cannot be waived.",
  "Oh, there are none?",
  "I'm not sure that a settlement is a waiver anyway. It's a vindication. You -- you vindicate your right to a settlement. I don't know that you waive it.",
  "How do you explain -- I mean, I think that is a principal point, whether Blake and Brieva changed the law. How do you explain the language in Matter of Wadud, which antedates by a good deal those two cases, 1984, which says: \"Section 212(c) can only be invoked in a deportation hearing where the ground of deportation charged is also a ground of inadmissibility.\" It seems to me that that's -- that's the basic point.",
  "Well, reliance on confused law is certainly not reasonable reliance. I mean, if you accept the -- the premise that Justice Kagan operates from, how can you say that -- that you're reasonably relying on confused law?",
  "Well, that's a -­",
  "That's a different point.",
  "But that -- what you say even further reduces the significance of the 212(c) possibility of waiver to the person pleading guilty. You're saying -- you're saying, yes, even though -- even though you couldn't get it under 212(c), there are a lot of other ways you might have gotten it.",
  "But -­",
  "Okay, but there's a large category of people who -- who plead guilty to crimes that do not involve moral turpitude and yet are not otherwise excludable under 212(c), right?",
  "Can I hear his answer? I was very interested in the question. It seemed to make a good point.",
  "Mr. Goldstein, what -- what you propose is reasonable enough, I suppose, and some States could adopt that kind of a protocol instead of what they have. But what you're asserting is that the Fourth Amendment prohibits them from adopting it, and the obstacle I see is that at the time the Fourth Amendment was adopted, this -- this was standard practice, to strip search people who were admitted to prisons. So, how could it be deemed an unreasonable invasion of privacy when it -- when it was done all the time and nobody thought it was unconstitutional?",
  "That is somehow less of an intrusion -­",
  "-- on your privacy, to be naked in front of a whole bunch of inmates, rather than one jail official inspecting?",
  "Mr. Goldstein, you -- YOU have acknowledged that we have held that when you have visitors, you may be strip -- strip searched after the visit and the same kind of close examination that you object to here. Now, your explanation why that is okay is that that is voluntary.",
  "That you don't have to have visitors. Can you really condition your -- your having visitors on your waiver of your Fourth Amendment rights?",
  "Are -- are you sure about that?",
  "You can -- you can condition certain -- certain privileges upon a waiver of constitutional privileges?",
  "I can understand that -- I can understand that for cavity searches, but -- but why for the search to see that -- if the person has any fleas or cooties or, you know, any -- any other communicable disease before he's put into the general population? Are -- are felons more likely to have those than non-felons?",
  "So, that line makes no sense for that aspect of the search which is -- is just we want to make sure that we have a clean prison.",
  "And that -- that's where the Fourth Amendment invasion of privacy line is to be drawn? If you're examined close up by someone who has a medical degree, it's okay? And, on the other hand, if it's someone who does not have a medical degree, it's not okay?",
  "That can't be the line as to whether your privacy is being invaded.",
  "Two arms' lengths. I mean, he could reach out, right?",
  "But, Mr. Phillips, there -­ there -­",
  "There is still an issue in the case beyond the ordinary visual inspection, and that is this: Even though you have changed your policy now -­",
  "-- the question remains whether that change in policy was constitutionally required, so that when -- when you treated the -- the plaintiff in a different fashion under the old policy, that was a violation of the Constitution. Doesn't -- doesn't that question remain in the case?",
  "Okay. So, there are two questions.",
  "So, we have to consider both, the pure visual and also the inspection for contraband.",
  "You -- you want us to write an opinion that applies only to squatting and coughing. Is that it?",
  "Yes.",
  "You acknowledge, though, that it's ineffective assistance of counsel if you're - - well, no, I guess you haven't acknowledged. Let me ask you: Have you provided ineffective assistance of counsel if you are a lousy bargainer? You're just no good at the -- you know, at -- I don't know -- the game of bargaining. And so, you do a bad job in bargaining down the sentence, I mean a notoriously bad job. Is that ineffective assistance of counsel?",
  "Well, I don't even agree with the first part. I don't think our legal process is -- is a bargaining game. Shouldn't be.",
  "No, the difference -- that's not the difference at all. It seems to me the difference is when you plead guilty you deprive yourself of the 24-karat test of fairness, which is trial by jury before nine people who have to find you guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. When you plead guilty, you give up that. When you don't plead guilty, you get what is the best thing in our legal system. You can't do any better than that.",
  "So, your position is you're entitled to effective assistance of counsel before you plead guilty, but you're not entitled to effective assistance of counsel in evaluating plea offers?",
  "All right.",
  "Mr. Jay, you disagree with the assertion that Justice Breyer made that this was unfair. This man deserved to get the sentence he got, didn't he? He had a full and fair trial. A jury of 12 people, finding him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, determined that he deserved that sentence. How could it be unfair to give him the sentence that he deserved?",
  "Mr. Jay, couldn't - - couldn't it be said that what our cases hold is that pleading guilty is a critical phase? Would that be enough to explain our cases?",
  "What if he turns -- what if he turns it down, Ms. Newman? He says, no, I can't accept this. What happens then? You have a new - -",
  "Yeah, the judge. It goes back to the judge. We agree with you, and we send it back to the judge. We reinstate the offer, okay? He accepts the offer. It goes to the judge, and the judge says: No, this is outrageous. I'm not going to approve this plea bargain. What happens then?",
  "We would have a new trial; is that it?",
  "Okay. So, if the judge turns it down, then the prior trial is valid; is that right?",
  "He turned it down because - -",
  "Wait. Both can't be perfect. Either he has another trial, although he's just been found guilty by a jury of 12 with an entirely fair proceeding, or else he doesn't have a new trial. Which is it?",
  "Like what? What factual variation do you think justifies a categorically different remedy? I mean, it seems to me some of the remedies are good and some are bad.",
  "What factual -- I mean, give me an example of the different remedies and how a certain fact situation could make one okay and the other not okay.",
  "Right. And why was that okay there?",
  "Why was that okay there? What -- what factual circumstances made that okay there?",
  "Don't -- don't blame it on me. I don't - -",
  "I don't -- it's your suggestion that we set aside a perfectly fair conviction.",
  "This is just a hypothetical. If you're going to set it aside - -",
  "-- I think you should put it back in.",
  "And there's no prejudice unless he would have accepted the deal.",
  "Of course, it is.",
  "Well, I -- I didn't understand that to be your position. There -- there is a statement in your brief that the question is whether plea negotiations that did not result in a guilty plea constitute a critical confrontation that gives the rise to effective assistance of counsel during such negotiations. So, I thought your position was that so long as the plea negotiations don't result in a guilty plea, effective assistance of counsel doesn't even come into the equation.",
  "I mean, you can say yes or no. I mean, you could retract -- retreat from - -",
  "-- that, I suppose, if you want.",
  "When they do not result in a guilty plea.",
  "Yes, but we don't care about that. You know, what do we care about that? I mean, we don't take cases to figure out those -- those, you know, picky, picky factual questions. The issue that I thought was important here is whether this is a critical stage when -- when the defendant is not -- does not accept the -- the plea and plead guilty.",
  "And if it were a critical stage, I suppose that counsel would be ineffective, not only if he was a lousy lawyer and didn't know the law, but if he was a bad negotiator. I mean -- right? Being a good criminal lawyer means you -- you got to be a good horse trader, right?",
  "Yes. You tell him to turn down a deal - -",
  "-- that in fact, you know, was a pretty good deal, that would be ineffective assistance of counsel. So, you must -- you must know how to handle yourself in the used car lot, right?",
  "No, but the guilty -- I mean, no, the reason that is not true is that the guilty plea must be entered with advice of counsel. You acknowledge that, don't you?",
  "So, the guilty plea doesn't erase everything if it has been entered without advice of counsel.",
  "You have admitted that you got what you deserved, right?",
  "Why? Why is it unfair for the law to apply to this individual the punishment he deserved for the crime that he committed? I mean, the object of the system is to put -- is to punish people who commit crimes in a certain degree. And here he admitted he did the crime, and he got the degree of punishment that the law provides. What could be more fair than that?",
  "Ex ante, I suppose you could say that. But when you look at it later, it's clear that that would have been unfair. In fact, this individual was perfectly willing to admit that he had been guilty of more than what the prosecutor had offered.",
  "That's true, and he did that when he entered the plea of guilty. You -- you do not contest he was well advised when he entered that plea that it was knowledgeable and he admitted that that's what he had done and was willing to accept the degree of punishment prescribed by law.",
  "Doesn't -- doesn't the rule that the plea offer may be withdrawn at any time by the prosecutor -- indeed, even after it has been accepted - - doesn't that well enough establish that there is no right to profit from that plea offer, that there is no constitutional right he's been deprived of, given that the prosecutor can withdraw it even after he accepts it?",
  "I -- I had hoped you were making some argument other than the knowing argument, because as prior discussion has shown, even if he had known, it would have made no difference to whether he accepted the later plea. Suppose he had been told, \"oh, by the way, there was an earlier plea. It's too late to accept it now. Do you want to take this plea?\" He says, \"well, oh, I'd like the earlier.\" \"I'm sorry, the earlier plea is gone. Do you want to take this plea or not?\" He would have taken it. What does the knowledge of the earlier lapsed plea have to do with whether his guilty plea is knowing and voluntary? It doesn't seem to me to have anything to do with that. So, I - -",
  "I thought you had some other argument that was somehow a right to profit from the earlier offer. And I find it hard to see that right, given that the prosecutor can withdraw the offer and, indeed, even withdraw it after it's accepted.",
  "And you would also - -",
  "But if that's ineffective assistance of counsel, surely it is ineffective assistance of counsel to advise him to turn down an offer that he should have snapped up. Isn't that ineffective assistance as well? If it's absolutely clear that this was a great deal, and the lawyer said, nah, you shouldn't take it -- is that ineffective assistance or not?",
  "I gave you the circumstances. It's clearly a super deal. Any good lawyer would have told him to take it.",
  "And this lawyer says don't take it. Is that ineffective assistance?",
  "It would not be?",
  "No, it would be ineffective assistance, and the question would be prejudice. Is that it?",
  "Well, give me a yes -- a yes or no to the question whether, if every reasonable lawyer would have told him to snap up this offer, but his counsel tells him, no, turn it down -- yes or no, is that ineffective assistance?",
  "Then we're in the soup. Then we're in the soup because every one of these pleas is subject to the contention that, oh, there was an earlier plea, or I should have -- I should have taken it but -- I mean -- and I suppose that if he goes to trial, then you would also say that trial should not have occurred because it was the ineffective assistance of counsel that caused him to turn down the plea, and, therefore, we're going to -- right -- retry it and set aside the trial?",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, but at the time, that offer could have been withdrawn by the prosecutor. And you're saying now it can't be withdrawn. So, you're really not putting him back in the situation he was in.",
  "I think that's right.",
  "And that's one of the things that causes us to be suspicious of whether there's a constitutional violation - -",
  "-- because there really isn't any perfect remedy.",
  "In some cases, not even a close to perfect remedy.",
  "I'm not sure I understand the difference between an open plea and a plea agreement. He just comes to the judge and says I'm willing to plead to this without the prosecution having offered it?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, he could still - -",
  "He could still - -",
  "But you're - -",
  "The lawyer would say, I can't find a starving case in California; so, you must not have a cause of action. Is that what the lawyer would say?",
  "What do you have besides starving? What -- what else?",
  "Well, so, if there is one State that would not have an adequate remedy for any - - any single bad thing that could happen in prison, there's a Bivens action for everybody for everything? Is that what you're saying?",
  "Wow.",
  "I certainly wouldn't want to hold that.",
  "Who says that the burden is on the other side? Why isn't the burden on you, if you want to bring a Bivens action, on you, to show that there is not an adequate State remedy?",
  "You're the plaintiff here. You're trying to bring the Federal cause of action. Our law is clear; if there's an adequate remedy we don't invent one. Why isn't it your burden to show that there is not an adequate State remedy?",
  "That's known as misquoting.",
  "I don't understand what you're talking about. Is this a suit against a prisoner who was attacked?",
  "He's not liable unless he's malicious, or what?",
  "The warden.",
  "I see. And -- and the warden is liable in Maryland, you say, only if he is malicious?",
  "Do you think that the warden of a Maryland prison is aware that if -- if he allows one prisoner to beat up another prisoner, he is only liable for maliciousness and not for deliberate indifference, if indeed there is a difference between the two? Do you think that -- that he's threading the needle that finely, as far as -- as far as deterrence is concerned?",
  "Not at that level of -- of refinement. I mean, it seems to me that any warden knows he's subject to State tort law and that State tort law renders him liable for negligence and, indeed, for physical assaults. Some of your causes of action are intentional torts, not even negligence. I find it hard to believe that, as far as deterrence is concerned, there's a dime's worth of difference between State law and -- and the Bivens action you're asking for.",
  "Do you want us to hold that there's no Bivens action in California? Is that -- is that what our opinion is going to say?",
  "Mitigating? Come on.",
  "Does it make her not a complaining witness?",
  "Okay.",
  "Is the prosecutor a complaining witness?",
  "Who instigates the prosecutor.",
  "Okay. What about the person who instigates the instigator?",
  "Well, somebody who comes up to somebody and says: You know, you ought to -- you ought to - -",
  "-- try to start a prosecution against this person. They say: Yeah, that's a good idea. So, that person goes and -- and gets a prosecution started.",
  "The person who instigates the instigator?",
  "So, the instigator of the instigator is -- is a complaining witness or can be?",
  "And you know what the next question's going to be, right?",
  "The instigator of the instigator of the instigator. I mean, does this go back forever?",
  "I don't understand.",
  "I really don't understand this. You have one witness in the grand jury proceedings. That's the only witness. Can that witness fall within your rule and be the complaining witness?",
  "Just on the basis of the testimony alone?",
  "So, it's pretty risky to testify in a grand jury proceeding, then, right?",
  "Because even though you haven't -- you don't care whether it comes out that way or not. You're subpoenaed, and even though you're subpoenaed, you're going to hold me as a complaining witness.",
  "Well, the affiants came forward. I mean, that -- that's a different situation, isn't it? They, indeed, were self-starting. But the person who is subpoenaed to testify at a grand jury is not self-starting. And you're saying that that person's mere presence and the mere fact of that person's testifying is enough to hold him to be the complaining witness.",
  "Yes.",
  "Hard or impossible?",
  "Hard or impossible?",
  "Okay. That's a different word. Thank you. So, the testimony alone cannot be the basis?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, you're saying that the only people who would be subject to suit for the malicious prosecution tort were complaining witnesses?",
  "You would acknowledge that if someone instigates the grand jury proceeding but does not testify, that person could be sued if indeed the instigation was malicious?",
  "Well, now, just answer my question. I've given you a hypothetical. He -- no doubt he instigated the grand jury proceeding. He got the -- the U.S. attorney to bring the proceeding, but he didn't testify. Could that person be sued?",
  "Okay. So, all he has to do to get himself off the hook is, after instigating it, he should testify, right? His testimony bathes him clean; is that it?",
  "All right. So, then it - - so, all you're arguing, then, is that there has to be some evidence other than the mere testimony; is that your point?",
  "Okay.",
  "I don't understand how it's waived. I don't understand that. How was it waived?",
  "I don't understand.",
  "Yes.",
  "How do you decide whether it's a jurisdictional bar? You acknowledge that the issuance by a judge of a certificate of appealability is a jurisdictional step; right?",
  "That is jurisdictional. If he doesn't do that, there's no jurisdiction.",
  "Okay. So -- so, the issue is whether (c)(3), which says the certificate of appealability \"shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required,\" whether that provision is a requirement for the validity of the certificate of appealability. If it is, then there's no jurisdiction, because the certificate of appealability is invalid.",
  "Isn't that right?",
  "Well, let's take the Fourth Amendment, I mean, which says, \"no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause.\" Okay? So -- but then it goes on, \"supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.\" Is the warrant valid if indeed it does not meet those requirements of being supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the --",
  "It won't be valid. It will just be invalid.",
  "Ms. Millett --",
  "-- it seems to me you beg the question when you say that the issue is whether the appeal will go forward. That's precisely what -- what the issue is here, whether it is that the appeal will go forward or whether an appeal on an identified issue will go forward. That's exactly what we're talking about.",
  "And it seems that the structure of the statute wants an appeal to go forward on a particular issue, and not in -- not in general on -- on who knows how many issues.",
  "It says it doesn't come forward -- doesn't come forward unless there is a certificate of appealability.",
  "And then it says the certificate of appealability shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required.",
  "I mean, I read that as saying you -- we're going to have an appeal but just an appeal on the issue that's identified.",
  "Well, but --",
  "You've done everything humanly possible, and just because of the mistake of a -- of a district judge, it can't go forward. But that happens. What if the district judge does -- makes a mistake and -- and he thinks that there has not been a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right? He makes a mistake about that. What happens?",
  "The same -- the same terrible result --",
  "Ms. Millett, as I understand the State, the State is not contending that (c)(2) is jurisdictional. So, you're -- you're arguing against a position they haven't taken. They -- they don't say that there's no jurisdiction if in fact there has been no substantial showing, so that the court of appeals has to review that. They're just saying that (c)(3), which describes the content of the -- of the certificate of appealability, is in effect jurisdictional.",
  "So, I think you're -- you're exaggerating the consequence of what the State is urging us to hold here.",
  "Right. The State wouldn't go into that. They're --",
  "Where -- where is 2244(d)(1)? I looked in your brief.",
  "To the petition for cert?",
  "Why isn't it in your brief? I mean, it's what your brief's about. Why isn't it in the appendix to your brief? It's also not in the appendix to the Government's brief. It's also not in an appendix to the State's brief. I have to go back to the -- to the petition to get it. I mean, it's what we're talking about here. I don't understand why the text is not -- is not in your brief, but that's --",
  "Mr. Mitchell, do you think the court of appeals could do it nunc pro tunc without -- without first making the determination that the trial judge was supposed to have made?",
  "But he would have to make the determination required by (c)(1), no?",
  "Yes. And --",
  "And that wouldn't necessarily point him just to the Speedy Trial Act. He'd have to see what other constitutional claims are in the case, right?",
  "Right.",
  "So there!",
  "Mr. Guerriero, if it's not -- if it's not limited to suggestive circumstances created by the police, why is unreliable eyewitness identification any different from unreliable anything else? So, shouldn't we look at every instance of evidence introduced in criminal cases to see if it was reliable or not?",
  "Do you think that our cases which exclude or -- or require reversal when there's eyewitness testimony impaired by the police -- you think that's really limited to eyewitness testimony? Suppose the police created suggestiveness in another category of evidence. Let's say -- let's say voice evidence, that the killer had left a message on the -- on the phone. And the police in some manner create suggestiveness that causes a witness to identify that as the voice of the killer. You really think that we would say, well, this is not eyewitness testimony; eyewitness testimony creates a special risk? Don't you think that we would say, whenever the police render evidence unreliable, it -- it should be excluded?",
  "Exactly. But that -- that impairs your argument, because if we accept your argument for eyewitness, we should similarly accept it for everything else. There's nothing special about eyewitness.",
  "No, I'm saying we don't mean it.",
  "I'm saying that it's unbelievable that if the -- if the police created testimony, not eyewitness testimony, but testimony that was unreliable because of police suggestiveness, I think we would throw that out as well. Don't you think so?",
  "What about -- what about unreliable eyewitness testimony in favor of the defendant? Let's assume the same suggestiveness that causes you to exclude it when it's been introduced by the prosecution, but here it's being introduced by the defendant to show that it was somebody else, okay? Is that going to be excluded?",
  "Do you think it should be excluded under the rules of evidence? If you say it's so unreliable -- this is a one-way door?",
  "All of the evidence that - - that causes the defendant to be convicted is excluded, but -- but any -- any evidence -- any evidence on the other side is not?",
  "No, but you see, when - - when it's the State that causes the unreliability, I can see why it is a -- a ground that can be invoked only by the defendant. But when you come up with a theory that it doesn't matter whether the State was the cause or not, I don't know why it wouldn't work both ways, that the evidence is inherently unreliable, and it ought to be excluded whether it helps the defendant or hurts the defendant.",
  "Once you take the State out of the mix, there's no reason to limit it to the -- to the defendant.",
  "Well - -",
  "Why not? I mean, that's the point. Why not? What about an eyewitness identification from 200 yards? You know, normally you'd leave it to the jury, and the jury would say that's very unlikely. But you want to say it's -- it has to be excluded, and if it's not, you retry the person. What is magic about suggestiveness as opposed to all of the other matters that could cause eyewitness identification to be wrong?",
  "But that's not -- we face that problem anyway, even if we -- whether or not we decide in this case that it doesn't matter that the police manipulated it, we're always going to have the problem of when has there been police manipulation; right?",
  "I mean, that -- that's not a creation of this -- of this case.",
  "And I -- I would guess that in the case you're talking about, just telling the person to stay where he is, is not -- now, it would be different if -- if the defendant was -- was caught two blocks away and the police bring him back to the scene of the crime and make him stand there so that the woman can see him from the window. That's quite different.",
  "Tell that to the jury. What jury isn't going to be -- I mean, the more persuasive your argument is, the more likely it is that a jury will take care of that.",
  "How would you prove fraud and deceit beyond proving that the person lied, intentionally lied? What -- what is added to intentionally lying to convert that into fraud or deceit?",
  "Isn't intentionally lying -- doesn't that mean that you intend to deceive?",
  "It doesn't?",
  "You must know that it's false when you say it. Isn't that what \"willfully\" means? You must know that the statement you're making is false.",
  "I don't want another adverb.",
  "I want you to describe what it means in the context of a statement. Doesn't it mean that you have to know that the statement you are making is false? Isn't that enough for willfulness?",
  "Okay. Now, you tell me what deceit involves beyond that.",
  "Do you have the text of it?",
  "I don't like counsel getting up here and talking about statutes that they've never put before us. If you're going to rely on it, we -- we would like to have the text somewhere.",
  "Well, why? Because it wouldn't be pointless if in fact an attempt to evade or defeat tax does not require a lie, does not require a willful lie. It would be adding to the -- to the fraud and deceit offenses, 7201, which does not require a lie. It just requires, you know, going to Cuba and writing postcards saying, I know I owe money; I'm just not -- I just ain't gonna pay it. There's no fraud and deceit there. It's just what 7201 requires, an attempt to evade or defeat tax.",
  "That's right. That's my very point.",
  "Without lying -- without lying -- without making a single lie.",
  "Yes. And my point is that it would not have been included within (M)(i). There is no way that it could be included with (M)(i), because it does not involve fraud or deceit. It does not involve a lie, as 7206 does.",
  "An attempt to evade or defeat -- \"who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax.\" And one can do that without lying. One can do that by simply not report income, for example. Or in -- in Justice Breyer's more colorful example, by going to Cuba. Was it Cuba or somewhere else?",
  "What about just not filing a return?",
  "Well, I -- I'm confused by the $10,000 requirement. Does that have to be an element of the offense?",
  "Just a consequence of the -- of the fraud or deceit, right?",
  "They still wouldn't -- no. Why? They still wouldn't be tax offenses.",
  "I mean, you use the mail to avoid -- still, what you're being prosecuted for is use of the mail to defraud.",
  "Well, he put it -- he put it wrong. He should have said -- just tax statutes are covered.",
  "Then -- then you wouldn't have to bifurcate, right?",
  "Well, it's not just that. It's -- it's also that -- that (M)(i) says loss to the victim or victims. And (M)(ii) says the revenue loss to the government has to exceed 10,000. I mean, in one case, it's the loss to the victim or victims. Why - - why did it use parallel language? Why -- or why did it say an offense that involves -- an offense in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000 and (i) involves fraud or deceit or (ii) is described in section 7201 of Title 26? I mean, if -- if you read it, it seems to contrast loss to the victim or victims with revenue loss to the government. And I find it hard to regard the government as a victim in any of these cases, to tell you the truth.",
  "Mr. Lewin, you're -- it seems to me you're not arguing for a co-equal congressional power; you're arguing for a superior congressional power. You're saying whatever Congress says, the President has to comply with. Now, that's quite different from saying that they both have authority in the field. And if they both have authority in the field and they're exercising it in different fashions, I frankly would not be inclined to intervene. I would let -- I would let them conduct the usual inter-branch hand wrestling that goes on all the time, which probably means that if Congress cares enough, Congress will win because, as you say, it has an innumerable number of clubs with which to beat the executive. But if -- if the power is a co-equal power and they're both exercising it in a -- in a different way, why don't we just, you know, let them go at it? Why is it any of our business which is the better foreign policy position?",
  "Congress is supreme, then? That is your position. Not -- not that Congress has co-equal authority with the executive, but Congress is supreme.",
  "What -- what were we scrutinizing in the Steel Seizure case?",
  "And what presidential power would have supported that, the war power?",
  "Right, because he was claiming that the Korean War -­",
  "-- required that these -­ that these companies remain in business. And I guess we did scrutinize that. What did we conclude, that that was -­",
  "But -­",
  "But a personal identification choice can also have significant foreign policy implications, can it not? Is -- is that an either-or situation? What the State Department is saying is to allow this particular personal identification choice may antagonize some foreign nations that we don't want to antagonize. What if they gave them the choice of saying \"Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East\"? Okay? That's their choice. They can have that on their passport. Would that be okay?",
  "What if -- what if the recognition of a breakaway province of a foreign country by the United States will clearly provoke a war with that country. Would Congress have the power to decree that the President shall not recognize that breakaway province, knowing -- knowing that if he does recognize it, that country will declare war on the United States?",
  "No, no. We have a foolish President.",
  "Contrary to our entire history, we have a -­",
  "Please stay on this.",
  "I am -- I am willing -­",
  "Our cases say repeatedly that the President is the sole instrument of the United States for the conduct of foreign policy, but to be the sole instrument and to determine the foreign policy are two quite different things. To say he's the sole instrument simply means that congressmen traveling abroad or globetrotting ex-presidents -- nobody except the President of the United States pronounces the foreign policy. But it doesn't necessarily mean that the President determines everything in foreign policy. He's the instrument, but there is certainly room in those many cases for saying that Congress can say what the -- what it's -- what the country's instrument is supposed to do.",
  "Well, it's the best there is.",
  "I mean, if you've got to cast about for something, I suppose -- I don't know what else you'd -- you'd land upon.",
  "Well, it is there. It doesn't say a whole lot.",
  "This textual commitment applies when somebody comes to the Court and asks for the Court to make the decision. If the plaintiff here had come in and -- without a congressional statute to rely upon, and had said, it is -- it is wrong for the State Department not to let me say \"Israel\" on my passport, then we would say, you know, textually committed to the executive. But this is a different situation where you have a -- a dispute between the two branches, and where that happens, I find it hard to say, well, you know, we can't get into it because why? Because it's textually committed to one of the branches? It seems to me we have to resolve that question.",
  "Yes, I -- I wanted to follow up on that. Does -- does that mean you're content to have this Court not say whether it's the exclusive executive power or -- or there's some congressional participation? I mean, if we just abstain, if we just say it's none of our business, it's none of our business; let you two guys fight it out -­ that's not what you're asking us to do, is it?",
  "You're asking us to decide the question that it is exclusively the presidential power.",
  "That doesn't sound to me like -- you know, like abstaining because it's a political question. It seems to me like deciding the case.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, I'd like to get to it now.",
  "I have to give a little prologue to my question. When -- when wiretapping first came before this Court, we held that it was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment because the Fourth Amendment says that the -- the people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures. And wiretapping just picked up conversations. That's not persons, houses, papers, and effects. Later on, we reversed ourselves, and, as you mentioned, Katz established the new criterion, which is, is there an invasion of privacy? Does -- are you obtaining information that a person had a reasonable expectation to be kept private? I think that was wrong. I don't think that was the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment. But, nonetheless, it's been around for so long, we're not going to overrule that. However, it is one thing to add that privacy concept to the Fourth Amendment as it originally existed, and it is quite something else to use that concept to narrow the Fourth Amendment from what it originally meant. And it seems to me that when that device is installed against the will of the owner of the car on the car, that is unquestionably a trespass and thereby rendering the owner of the car not secure in his effects -- the car is one of his effects -- against an unreasonable search and seizure. It is attached to the car against his will, and it is a search because what it obtains is the location of that car from there forward. Now, why -- why isn't that correct? Do you deny that it's a trespass?",
  "Well, that's too bad. That doesn't make it a trespass. I mean - -",
  "It may be a sneaky thing to do, but -- but every sneaky thing is not a trespass.",
  "So, we've narrowed the Fourth Amendment?",
  "So, the -- the privacy rationale doesn't expand it but narrows it in some respects.",
  "Undoubtedly, but the rationale of that case was that it was not an unreasonable - -",
  "-- it was not an unreasonable search.",
  "Don't we have any legislatures out there that can stop this stuff?",
  "Is that right? I don't own my license plate? I didn't know that. How do you know that?",
  "How do you know that? I paid for my license plate.",
  "Well, this is ridiculous. Look at -- you give the State permission to put the license plate -- to carry -- to have your car carry the State's license plate. You do not give anybody permission to have your car carry a tracking device.",
  "And whether it's put directly on the car or directly on something that the car is carrying doesn't seem to me to make any difference.",
  "That doesn't make it a seizure. That doesn't make it a seizure. It makes it a search.",
  "I mean, you can say that there's a trespass for the purpose of obtaining information, which makes it a search. But I don't see how it's a seizure. A seizure -- you have to bring something within your control. You have to stop the person or stop the vehicle. What has been seized when you -- when you slap a tracking device on a car?",
  "Do you have any case involving seizure of data floating in the air as opposed to papers?",
  "Well, it must be unconstitutional if it's scary.",
  "I mean, what is it, the scary provision of what article?",
  "Mr. Leckar, your -- all of this discussion -- you're going into it, but the questioning leads you into it -- it seems to me leaps over the difficult part of your case. The issue before us is not -- not in the abstract whether this police conduct is unreasonable. The unreasonableness requirement or the unreasonableness prohibition does not take effect unless there has been a search. And our cases have said that there's no search when -- when you are in public and where everything that you do is open to -- to the view of people. That's the hard question in the case, not whether this is unreasonable. That's not what the Fourth Amendment says, the police can't do anything that's unreasonable. They can do a lot of stuff that's unreasonable without violating the Fourth Amendment, and the -- the protection against that is the legislature. But you have to establish, if you're going to go with Katz, that there has been an invasion of - - of privacy when all that -- all that this is showing is where the car is going on the public streets, where the police could have had round-the-clock surveillance on this individual for a whole month or for 2 months or for 3 months, and that would not have violated anything, would it?",
  "Why? Because there's no invasion of privacy. So, why is this an invasion of privacy?",
  "A hundred times zero equals zero. If -- if there is no invasion of privacy for 1 day, there's no invasion of privacy for a hundred days. Now, it may be unreasonable police conduct, and we can handle that with laws. But if there's no invasion of privacy, no matter how many days you do it, there's no invasion of privacy.",
  "So is a tail. So is a tail when the police surveil -- surveil you for -- for a month.",
  "Excellent. Yes. Of course, a legislature can take care of this, whether or not there is an invasion of privacy. And they can pick 5 days out of the air. You can't do it for any more than 5 days, or you can't do it to more than -- than 50 people at a time. They can take care of all of that stuff. We can't do that in a decision under the - - under the Fourth Amendment.",
  "Why isn't this precisely the kind of a problem that you should rely upon legislatures to take care of?",
  "I don't see why it's any of Congress's business if it's a -- if it's a purely intrastate operation. Congress can control police practices that don't violate the Fourth Amendment throughout the country? I mean, maybe interstate, interstate beepers and interstate tracking devices, yes, but so long as you track within -- within the State isn't that okay?",
  "Yes, what were these - -",
  "They're uncommon to me. These - -",
  "These were not gold teeth that were implanted, right? They -- what was it? Some kind of a mouthpiece of gold?",
  "I'm sorry to hear that.",
  "And not only the only eyewitness but, if I understand it correctly, the only evidence against the defendant. This was the only evidence against him, this one eyewitness identification, right? Was there anything else?",
  "Well - -",
  "You don't say all of them. All of them didn't apply to the - -",
  "That applied to everyone, right?",
  "The one at the scene applied to everyone.",
  "\"I can't identify anyone.\"",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay.",
  "I -- may I suggest that - -",
  "-- you stop fighting as to whether it should be turned over? Of course, it should have been turned over. I think the case you're making is that it wouldn't have made a difference.",
  "And -- and that's a closer case, perhaps, but surely it should have been turned over. Why don't you give that up?",
  "What about purchase? What about -- what about the contract to purchase? The California law addresses that. Do you -- do you contend that that is pre-empted as well?",
  "How so?",
  "Or contract of purchase. I mean, if the contract of purchase is made apart from the slaughterhouse itself, they could make it unlawful for the -- the person who raises the animals to sell them when they're nonambulatory and unlawful for the slaughterhouse to contract to buy them, right, so long as the contract is off the premises?",
  "Okay.",
  "And that presumably is why Congress excluded cats and dogs?",
  "So, Lassie -- Lassie and Kitty are no good?",
  "But Dobbin is all right.",
  "But I guess the -- the State could make it unlawful for a rancher or -- what are the people that ship the animals to you called? Could it - -",
  "A rancher or farmer could make it unlawful for them to ship a nonambulatory swine, could they not?",
  "Yes, but as far as this statute is concerned, it would not preclude a State law that forbids a -- a rancher to -- to ship a nonambulatory swine, right?",
  "Do we have to peel this onion in order to decide this case? I mean, do we have to go through - -",
  "-- each little provision of the statute and say this is in, this is out, this is in, this is out?",
  "Can't we just either affirm or reverse the particular preliminary injunction that was -- that was issued here?",
  "I'd like to get out of the work, to tell you the truth.",
  "Well, no. No. Provisions of the Act, at least as amended, also require humane treatment of the animals while they're being processed. That has nothing to do with whether the meat is any good. It has to do with humane treatment of the animals.",
  "Wait. I don't -- you mean the Federal requirements of humane treatment do not apply once the slaughterhouse decides that this animal will not be slaughtered for meat; then the slaughterhouse can do whatever it wants with the poor animal? That can't be right.",
  "What about the provision that says that they will not be exposed to sharp - - sharp instruments that can injure them? Does that apply to only those that are going to be sold for meat?",
  "Well, wait, no. But that Act amends, amends, the Act that does have a pre-emption clause.",
  "And, therefore, it seems to me the pre-emption clause applies to the humane provisions as well.",
  "Just in slaughterhouses. I mean, to the extent it's incorporated in that Act, it only applies to humane treatment by slaughterhouses, right?",
  "Well, but - -",
  "Well, it's an additional requirement. I don't know why it's conflict pre-emption. It's express pre-emption. If indeed the Federal regulations say that these diseases disqualify the animal from being slaughtered and sold as meat, and California says no, we think additional diseases should disqualify the slaughter and sale, that's an additional requirement. I don't know how you say that's somehow conflict pre-emption. It's express pre-emption.",
  "You keep saying \"not within the scope.\" I don't know what you mean by \"not within the scope.\" Why is it not within the scope?",
  "Right, and what -- what limits it? What enables the State to disqualify other diseases that the Federal law does not disqualify?",
  "\"No additional requirements\" is what the Act says.",
  "Well, it doesn't say that. It says \"no additional requirements\" with respect to all of the operations, both the operations that pertain to those animals that are later sold as meat and the operations that pertain to those animals that are slaughtered and whose carcasses are burned or disposed of. How do you get the limitation to only those animals that are -- that are slaughtered for meat?",
  "But we're not talking about conflict pre-emption. If it said you must and the State says you can't, then there would be conflict pre-emption. But we're talking about express pre-emption, which says in so many words no additional requirements. And I don't know how you can get around the fact that this is an additional requirement.",
  "I don't think that's what within the scope means. The pre-emption provision here in the statute has two provisions. The first one, which is the one we're talking about, says requirements within the scope of this chapter with respect to premises, facilities, and operations which are in addition to or different than those made under this chapter may not be imposed. That's the first one. Okay? Requirements within the scope with respect to premises, facilities. Now, the second pre-emption provision reads: \"marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirements in addition to, or different than, those made under this chapter.\" Now, I read the difference between those two being, under number two it has to be different from something that has been made; whereas under number one, it just has to be different from anything that could have been made under this chapter. It's within the scope of the chapter. It's within the Secretary's authority to prescribe under this chapter. I think that's what Congress meant by the difference between requirements within the scope and, in number two, \"in addition to, or different than, those made,\" and that to my mind is -- is a much more plausible explanation of \"within the scope\" than -- you know, it's directed to the purpose of -- of the statute. I don't think within the scope has anything to do with the purpose. It has to do with whether the Secretary is authorized to act in this field under the chapter.",
  "The other argument is that it is within the scope of the Act because it is pre-eminently something that the Secretary is authorized to regulate, this nefarious diamond skin disease which we're all familiar with.",
  "It's within the scope of the Act, because he could act and indeed is -- is told to act to prevent stuff like that. And that's why it's within the scope of the Act for California to do something in addition to what he has chosen to do. And that's why there's a difference between one and two, requirements within the scope, and marketing, labeling, and packaging requirements in addition to or different from those made. This one isn't made, but it is within the scope of what the Secretary could make. And, therefore, California should butt out.",
  "Suppose I agree with you on that but don't agree with you -- or least I'm dubitante on that and -- and disagree with you on the rest. What do I do?",
  "You -- you would say once there's an accident and the locomotive is disabled, it's no longer in use. I suppose that's what you'd say.",
  "It's unrealistic, but that's what you'd say.",
  "Don't you think that one of the purposes of the legislation, which everybody understood, was to enable engine manufacturers to be able to construct their engines without having to worry about a variety of different State requirements? Railroading is a national transportation industry, and whoever makes the engine has to know, if I do it this way, it's going to be okay.",
  "And you're saying it won't be okay because, although every State may have -- every State's requirements may be pre-empted when the -- when the locomotive is in use, all 50 States can have different requirements with respect to what the design has to be in order to make the engine safe when it's being repaired. I think that truly frustrates the purpose of the Act.",
  "I'm not -- I'm not concerned about conflict pre-emption. I'm not concerned about State requirements that conflict with the Federal. I'm talking about 50 State requirements that conflict with each other, so that the manufacturer has to look to all 50 States instead of looking to the Secretary here, which says your engine is safe if you do this. And you're telling me the manufacturer can no longer assume that.",
  "Well, what -- what self-abnegation by the Federal Government, that \"safe for use\" does not include safe for use when it's being repaired.",
  "Do you have any - -",
  "I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
  "But only the design, materials, and constructions for use. If you make that concession, it's only those aspects of design, materials, and construction that pertain to use. And if you take the position that use includes only use on the line and not use when it's being repaired in the repair shop, I think you're in trouble.",
  "It's design for use.",
  "I'm not talking about the word \"design\"; I'm talking about \"design for use.\"",
  "What would apply to the repair shop would also apply to the locomotive in use, I suppose, and it would be of little comfort to the manufacturer that although the engine he has manufactured has been certified as safe for use by the Secretary, he is liable unless he warns the engineer: Oh, it isn't safe for use in these circumstances; I have to give you warning. I mean, I cannot imagine that that's what - - that that's what the statute means as applied, at least to the use of the engine on the -- on the tracks.",
  "Can the manufacturer be held liable for failing to tell the railroad?",
  "How is the railroad going to know whether it's unsafe or not?",
  "How is the railroad going to know whether there's asbestos in there unless the manufacturer at least tells the railroad, even it doesn't have to tell the worker?",
  "Well, they're -- they're not saying here you have to manufacture it a certain way. They're just saying if you manufacture it in a manner that we consider unsafe, you have to warn people.",
  "Do you have anything more than implication here?",
  "Well, how is that? I mean, the description of the right of action is that it exists only if permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State.",
  "That's --",
  "What -- what is a description of the cause of action then?",
  "Where is it in the statute? I mean, I'm reading the section --",
  "-- that says -- under \"Protection of subscriber privacy rights,\" subsection (5) is entitled \"Private right of action,\" and the only right of action it describes is that a person who has received more than one telephone call -- blah, blah, blah -- \"may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State, bring in an appropriate court of that State\" actions. Now, even if you say that that cause of action is bringable in Federal court, why wouldn't it be still governed by the laws of a State?",
  "That's fine. Then where is the creation of a private right of action bringable in Federal court apart from State laws? Where does that exist in this statute? I don't see it here.",
  "Can --",
  "When there is suit in Federal court, let's say these attorney general suits, what are the suit -- what is the suit governed by? Is it governed by State law?",
  "Well, I mean, I -- Federal law mirroring State law?",
  "Well, it's the authority to enforce, right?",
  "Civil actions brought under the subsection.",
  "So, you have a different -- a different -- a different law applied if -- and the State law limitations don't apply if it's a suit in Federal court by -- by an attorney general?",
  "I mean, it's so weird. I can't understand that.",
  "Can Congress create a Federal -- can Congress in effect delegate to the States the contours of a -- a Federal cause of action? I mean, you keep talking about it as a Federal cause of action.",
  "But it's not really, if -- if its existence or non-existence depends upon State law; or at least it depends upon State law, you say, if it's brought in State courts; however, if it's brought in Federal court by the Attorney General, you have a totally different law applying, a Federal law.",
  "Yes, but the difference is that the 1983 cases don't deal with what this deals with, which is displacement of the jurisdiction of Federal courts. And we are jealous of our jurisdiction, not only in the constitutional cases that you refer to, but in all cases. And I had thought that the general rule that you have to be clear when you take cases out of the Federal courts -- I thought that that applies not just where you're dealing with a constitutional jurisdiction but also where you're dealing with already-conferred statutory jurisdiction. And why shouldn't I apply that presumption?",
  "It didn't deal with the jurisdiction of Federal courts. That's what gets our hackles up --",
  "-- when you're telling us we have been ousted of jurisdiction.",
  "We don't like that.",
  "Except that that's the only section that creates a private right of action.",
  "That's not so extraordinary. It's what has to be shown in -- in Sherman Act cases, right? Contracts and combinations in -- in restraint of trade are unlawful; but in order to recover under the Sherman Act, you have to show not only that it was unlawful, but that you were harmed by it.",
  "Well, but --",
  "-- let's assume that a trustee acts on its own interest and sells property, but let's assume that he gets top dollar for that property, so that the beneficiary hasn't really been deprived of anything. What's the injury to the beneficiary?",
  "Could --",
  "Could Congress decree that the agent in this case shall be an agent of the purchaser rather than an agent of the title insurance company? As it has done in real estate, I think. The real estate broker must be an agent of the seller and not of the purchaser. Can it -- can it establish a trust relationship between the purchaser here and the person selecting the title insurance company?",
  "And if it did, would the violation of that trust relationship constitute injury for -- for Article III purposes?",
  "We don't require injury-in-fact for most breaches of trust, do we?",
  "Well, I understand, but I'm just saying that that concrete interest can be created by Congress instead of being created by contract. What difference does it make? If you become a trustee by contract, you get one result; but if you are a trustee by government decree so that you must be a trustee, contract or not?",
  "Somehow the situation changes?",
  "You speak of a duty of loyalty. There's no duty of loyalty owed here. It was just a law that said you cannot get -- and I'm not even sure it's proper to call it a kickback. It's a commission. These people are agents for the title insurance company, and they get a commission on -- on every sale of title insurance that they make. You can call it a kickback, I suppose. I don't know why the other side does. But -- but it seems to me a commission. There's no duty of loyalty. Isn't -- isn't the seller here the agent of the title insurance company?",
  "We have a different -- we have a different case then.",
  "But they didn't do that, did they?",
  "Well, the issue isn't whether they can afford it legal protection. They certainly can. And there can be suits by -- by the Federal Government or, I think, under this statute even by State -- State attorneys general. The issue isn't whether Congress can achieve that result. It's whether they can achieve it by permitting private suits.",
  "If I take a car to an auto mechanic, he's not my agent. He's an independent contractor doing business. He's not my agent.",
  "And it's not an agency relation here, either.",
  "It's a customer going to somebody who is an independent contractor.",
  "More than agents and fiduciaries across the board. He is neither an agent nor a fiduciary. And what's the closest case you have to a situation where there is neither an agency relationship nor a trust relationship, and yet this kind of a right to sue without showing damage exists? What's the -- what's your best shot?",
  "And you don't want to have to prove that, because if you proved any damage, there goes your class action --",
  "-- because you don't have commonality.",
  "How does it -- how does it harm her to get a title insurance policy for the price of $453 from what you call a kickback-free seller, as opposed to getting the same title insurance for $453 from a non-kickback-free seller? Is that an injury-in-fact?",
  "The -- the vague notion of -- of buying it from -- from -- I don't know, a white knight? Is that the kind of injury-in-fact that our cases talk about?",
  "It seems to me purely -- I don't know -- philosophical.",
  "Doubtless Congress wanted to get out of the business. But the issue here is whether Congress can get out of the business, whether it is the function of courts to provide relief to people who haven't been injured. I mean, that's -- that's -- that's the whole issue.",
  "Suppose -- Mr. Yang, let me give -- give you a hypothetical. Suppose, you know, Congress did this to spare the Attorney General the necessity of suing to enforce these requirements. Suppose Congress wants to take the burden off the back of the Internal Revenue Service. So, it says that anybody who buys any product from a company that has not paid its taxes is entitled to $500. Okay? What that person is entitled to is a -- a tax-observant seller, given a national right to a tax-observant seller. Would every person who buys from some -- some company that hasn't paid its taxes have a cause of action?",
  "Why not?",
  "But this is differentiated. You have to have bought from one of these companies. It's not everybody. Not everybody has bought from these tax cheats.",
  "It's only the people who bought from tax cheats.",
  "A nexus, right? Your brief is full of \"nexus\" --",
  "It's legal jargon for \"connection.\"",
  "Lovely. Say \"connection.\" I like it.",
  "I love it.",
  "Okay.",
  "How much of a connection is -- is necessary? Suppose you have a law that requires all machine parts produced by companies to -- to contain a certain feature, and anyone who buys one that doesn't contain that feature gets $500. I purchase one. That feature is of no use to me at all. That product would be just as good for me for the purposes for which I am using it had it not had that feature. Would that be okay? Would I have a cause of action?",
  "So, even though I've installed my own safety harness, which I always do when I buy a car, I --",
  "-- I can sue because this car that they sold me didn't have the safety harness?",
  "500 bucks.",
  "What is -- I'm sorry, Chief, go ahead.",
  "Not yours and his?",
  "What about a -- I'm sorry to interrupt your -- your concluding remarks, but I am troubled by the dollar nominal damages for breach of contract. What do you say about that?",
  "We'll hear argument next in Case Number 10-1261, Credit Suisse Securities v. Simmonds. Mr. Landau, you may proceed.",
  "Of course, Lampf was a disaster, wasn't it? Congress had to try to patch up what we had done.",
  "Gee, but we've -- we've said that, under our recent jurisprudence anyway, we would -- we would treat that as a statute of limitations. And I assume we'd treat it like a normal statute of limitations subject to tolling.",
  "You think whenever -- whenever we encounter a -- a statute of limitations that is -- is phrased in jurisdictional term, there can be no tolling?",
  "I don't -- I think you understate the -- the strength of Petitioners' argument in this regard. It seems to me where you say, you know, 3 years unless the plaintiff knows sooner than that, and then you say 2 years unless the plaintiff knows earlier than that, and then you say 2 years -- it seems to me that the implication is 2 years, period. Whether the plaintiff knows earlier, later, doesn't matter.",
  "Well, but what if those three provisions had been -- you know, followed each other immediately? You know, 3 years unless, you know -- with a cutoff that would make it shorter, and 2 years with a cutoff that would make it shorter, and then a third one just says 2 years. You think there would be no implication that the 2 years means 2 years, period?",
  "Maybe -- maybe you'd better go -- well, go on. I think you'd better go to the other point because I want to know whether you differ from the Petitioner on the second point. As I understand the Petitioner, he does -- he does not think that you reach the same result if indeed the violation had been nonintentional. Now, do you take that position as well?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Wall. That's a nice note on which to end. Mr. Tilden, we will hear from you.",
  "They need not go elsewhere, but when they have gone elsewhere and have found out -- I mean, in this case, it's -- it was not just that you reasonably should have known; it's you did know. Isn't -- am I right about that?",
  "Oh. Okay.",
  "Is that necessary to your cause of action?",
  "One would think, if the 16(b) plaintiff has really suffered no injury, it would be all the more likely that Congress would want a statute of repose.",
  "The -- the problem I have with your argument is it's a very strange statute of limitations. Accepting that it is not a statute of repose, it says, you know, you have 2 years after the -- the transaction that was failed to be reported. And you want to say what it means is you have 2 years from the time it was reported. Congress would have said that. It's so easy to say that. Two years from the reporting.",
  "But I don't know any other statute of limitations that achieves the result that you want that puts it that way.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Tilden. Mr. Landau, you have 4 minutes.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Landau. The case is submitted.",
  "But -- but the problem is that, with an exception that -- that's not applicable here, section 1399 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that no separate taxable entity shall result from the commencement of a case under Title XI of the United States Code. How can you incur a tax when you are not a separate taxable entity?",
  "Well, if -- if that exception were intended, the provision I read contains an exception. It says \"except in any case to which section 1398 applies.\" 1398 applies to chapter 7 and chapter 11 where the debtor is an individual.",
  "Now, if there is an additional exception for chapter 12 of the sort that you allege, why wasn't that put in there?",
  "What does it mean, then, to say that no taxable -- \"no separate taxable entity shall result\"? What does it mean, unless it means that it is not the estate which incurs the tax?",
  "Well, but they -- but they would not have needed the exceptions for chapter 7 and chapter 11 where the debtor is an individual if what you say is true, if indeed a bankrupt estate is, as you say, not an entity at all.",
  "What -- what the Government would say is -- is that -- and they have their own dictionary definitions. I don't -- I don't think it's accurate to say that Black's Law Dictionary defines \"actual damages\" the way you would have it defined. As I recall, their briefing gives some other definitions from an earlier version of Black's or whatever. But what they say about the commission understanding, which you acknowledge to be contrary to your understanding of actual damages, what they say is that at least shows that it isn't clear what \"actual damages\" means. And -- and in their estimation, once you -- once you establish that it isn't clear, then you trigger the -- the rule that waivers of sovereign immunity will not be considered to have any scope except that scope which is clear.",
  "Of course, you're talking about statutes that require that the material have been made public, not that, say, establish a violation if one agency provides the information to another agency? I mean, as the Government points out, this -- this statute goes far beyond any -- any State statutory or common law protections of privacy. It's really very picky, picky. And -- and to say that, you know, whatever emotional harm comes from that is -- is quite different from saying that under State privacy laws emotional distress is compensable.",
  "Well, that's right. But all you have to know is that you shouldn't give it to the other agency, because you're not making it public. You're not doing the kind of thing that constitutes an invasion of privacy under State law. You've just failed, intentionally failed, to follow the very detailed and, as I say, picky, picky prescriptions contained in the Privacy Act. To say that you get emotional distress for that as opposed to genuine -- what I would call genuine privacy incursions, which State law covers, is a different question.",
  "You say that in the Fifth Circuit or the Ninth Circuit for -- for many years?",
  "Has had this for a long time. Okay.",
  "That -- that's a different point. And the question went to whether you acknowledge the need to be unambiguous. Now, what the Government says is, of course, the -- the waiver of sovereign immunity, you would acknowledge, must be unambiguous, but the Government says further, moreover, the scope of the waiver of -- of sovereign immunity must be unambiguous. Whether you have waived it only with respect to pecuniary damages or also with respect to emotional harm, that also must be unambiguous. And -- and you deny that second step, don't you? You think --",
  "You don't?",
  "But -- but -- but elsewhere in the statute, it's made very clear that Congress did not think it was authorizing general damages, right? Because it set up this commission to recommend whether general damages should be included. Now, what would be -- what would be the purpose of that commission if indeed actual damages already included general damages?",
  "You would say that actual emotional damages are not -- are not general damages?",
  "No, but it -- it does use the term \"general damages\" and makes very clear that it doesn't think this statute covers general damages. So, I think -- I think you have to argue that the term \"general damages\" includes only \"presumed\" emotional harm and not \"proven\" emotional harm.",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, isn't it true that the bureaucrat used to make that decision not too long ago?",
  "When we had a parole system. Before we had the sentencing guidelines, it was up to the Bureau of Prisons whether to give parole or not, right?",
  "Some bureaucrat in the Bureau of Prisons, I guess.",
  "It's not unthinkable.",
  "I'm not clear on what the -- what the Government's view of, whatever you want to call it, inherent judicial sentencing power is. You -- you -- before section 3584 was passed, there -- there was the power on the part of the Federal courts to decide whether sentences should run concurrently or sequentially, right?",
  "How do you know?",
  "I mean, it did not -- what authority it did have did not come from a statute, right?",
  "Where is the Attorney General's authority prescribed?",
  "His authority to say where the sentence will be served?",
  "Oh, that's -- that seems to be quite --",
  "-- quite fanciful.",
  "Nunc pro tunc, right?",
  "And you get that out of this -- this lean language here?",
  "I thought we tried to get rid of all of that when we abolished the parole system. I thought we tried to take away from the bureaucrats the decision to let somebody out earlier because he's been a good boy and hold him longer because he hasn't.",
  "The Government says that the Federal courts never had that power anyway, so that nothing is being restricted. And they contest the cases that you've cited as demonstrating the existence of that power in the situation involved here to -- to determine whether a future -- a sentence to be imposed in the future by State courts will be concurrent or consecutive with the Federal one.",
  "Well, somebody has to make that call.",
  "I mean, if you say -- it's either the judge or the jailer. There's nobody -- who else is going to make it?",
  "So, if you say the judge can't, it's going to be the Bureau of Prisons.",
  "Am -- am I correct, Mr. Young, that if -- if the Federal sentencing judge is erroneous in his prediction of what the State court later sentencing will do, that his order, based upon that erroneous prediction, can be altered upon appeal by the Bureau of Prisons?",
  "But it isn't good faith here; that's the problem, that we don't have a good faith test. We -- we have a test that goes beyond good faith. Even if the officer is in good faith, according to the test we've set forth, if he's so stupid that -- that he -- he executes a warrant that no reasonable officer could think was correct, he's -- he's in the pot, right?",
  "Excuse me. Why are you going back to good faith? I mean, that's --",
  "-- that's what I think is the problem with this case. If it's a good faith test, you come out with one result. But the test we've expressed is not good faith. This -- this police officer could have been in the best of faith, but if he's a very bad police officer, he's in the soup, right?",
  "We don't have a good faith test for this purpose.",
  "So, whenever -- I'm sorry.",
  "But the -- the warrant didn't just authorize, you know, firearms wrapped in gang colors. It allowed him to search for any evidence of gang membership, right?",
  "But what possible purpose could that serve?",
  "If they were wrapped in it, yes. But we know he's a gang member.",
  "So, all that the finding of gang membership decals or whatever they wear -- all that would show is, indeed, this guy was a gang member.",
  "And even then --",
  "But they -- they knew he was in that premise. I mean, that -- I really don't understand how you can possibly search for indicia of gang membership. When you know the man's a gang member, so what?",
  "And what does that depend on, whether you would look for the indicia of gang memberships in places where you wouldn't look for guns; is that it?",
  "Well, if you're looking for photographs that show gang membership, I guess you could look through photograph albums. You wouldn't really look there for guns, would you?",
  "But the most narrow circumstance is defined as a circumstance in which no reasonable police officer could have thought the warrant was correct. Why don't we adopt a good --",
  "-- a good faith test for this as we do in other -- in other --",
  "A policeman. Policeman.",
  "Well, I don't like this mishmash. Look, it's either good faith or it's -- however good his faith was, however well he showed his good faith by checking with his superiors or what not, if he made -- if he made an incompetent decision, it's incompetent. And we should not mix the two, it seems to me.",
  "That would be wonderful if the test was, was this -- did this officer know that this was a bad affidavit and was acting in bad faith in executing it? If that was the test, then indeed the fact that he had checked with his superiors and all of that good stuff would -- would have some relevance.",
  "Of course, you could say that about any test, you know? If you apply it protectively, it will protect.",
  "And if you don't apply it protectively, it won't protect.",
  "I'd like a test that, you know, that protects when it ought to and doesn't protect when it ought not.",
  "And the warrant authorized the search for and seizure of all guns, not just the guns belonging to Bowen. And in --",
  "-- in fact, they seized some of the Millenders' guns, didn't they?",
  "And why is it -- if there's probable cause to believe that he has other guns, is there also probable cause to believe that any gun found in the house will belong to him? I think not.",
  "Ultimately, it's the officer who goes into the Millenders' house, seizes their arms, rifles through their drawers. It's -- it's the officer that does that?",
  "Oh, I didn't understand that.",
  "They -- they did not execute the warrant?",
  "But -- but the context here, one would expect it to say, if it meant what you say it meant a -- did not claim a use asserted by the generic.",
  "Not just \"did not claim a use.\" And we have to fill in, that is \"the use asserted by the generic.\" That's a strange thing to fill in.",
  "It's not a matter of elegance. It's a matter of how I would have expected it to be -- to be framed if it meant what you -- what you say it means. It's so easy to say \"does not claim the use asserted by the generic.\" My goodness. And that's what you say it means.",
  "Yes, well, it's not much, but it's something.",
  "And -- and the way you're talking, you seem to assume that all the problems in the world have to be addressed by this statute. Would you have no remedy by -- by suing the FCC for accepting uses that -- that it should not have accepted?",
  "That's true, but it -- but if you have alternative remedies, I am not terribly shocked by the fact that you don't have a remedy under this statute.",
  "Well, it's -- it's -- the issue is not whether Congress enacted it only for that. The issue is whether Congress enacted it for that in addition to a lot of other stuff.",
  "I mean, it's a very small detail, you know -- \"correct.\" You're saying this one word, \"correct,\" in this immense bill with all sorts of causes of actions and other provisions here and there -- that one word has this -- this minimal meaning.",
  "It's conceivable.",
  "Can you give us of the cite of that, please?",
  "You don't have to do it now. Just -- just file it with the Court. I don't want to eat your time up.",
  "Oh, it's cited in your principal brief?",
  "Yes. Don't waste your time. Go ahead.",
  "I don't really care.",
  "What do you mean by the problem of improper listing?",
  "And even if it were, as I believe the Government acknowledged, this is not a situation in which we owe deference to the FDA. The issue is whether a lawsuit can be brought or not.",
  "And we -- we don't decide whether we have authority to decide cases on the basis of what the agency thinks.",
  "And what do you say about the -- the section cited by -- by your colleague?",
  "No, you don't want that. You don't want to stay whatever words you use.",
  "You want us to say the words to be used are the words that we use in deciding whether you have been accorded your constitutional right to counsel, right?",
  "A volunteer issue? What are you talking about? I'm --",
  "You call that a volunteer --",
  "Volunteer. Volunteering to be executed?",
  "Mr. Waxman, the State contends that the interest of justice standard is not the right one. Why do you contend that it is? It doesn't appear in -- in 3599, even though it did appear in -- in the previous provision that used to cover these cases, which is 3006A(c). You want to carry it over from 3006A(c) to 3599. That seems to me a little strange when they seemingly intentionally omitted it.",
  "You -- you don't think it's an iffy case?",
  "Well, that would just show that the material went to and came back from the lab. It wouldn't show what the lab results were. It was the results that she testified to, right?",
  "And what other evidence was there of the results besides her testimony?",
  "No other.",
  "Well, it would be utterly irrelevant, would it not, if the statements were not true? I mean, it's one thing for an expert to testify about a hypothetical, you know: Assuming this, this, this, Mr. Expert, what would the result be? Well, on those assumptions, it would be this. But this was not -- nobody asked -- asked her to assume those things at all. She testified that -- that she had a match between what she had done and what had been done on the -- on the DNA of this individual by somebody else.",
  "That seems to me quite different from the -- from the ordinary hypothetical put to an expert.",
  "You're not objecting to hearsay, are you, counsel? You're objecting to a violation of the Confrontation Clause --",
  "-- which is quite different from what -- what Mr. Wigmore was writing about, which was hearsay.",
  "We've said the contrary, though, haven't we?",
  "Justice Breyer dissented from those opinions.",
  "-- Justice Breyer's dissent.",
  "It's up to the prosecutor which of those 12 he wants to bring in, whether he wants to bring in all 12 or just 1. If he thinks the jury will be sufficiently persuaded by bringing in just one, he can bring in just one, right?",
  "But he has to bring in the one and not -- and not hearsay about what the one would say.",
  "No, but didn't she say, I relied on stuff that I received from -- from Caremark -- whatever the name of the lab was?",
  "She said: I -- I relied on material that was a swab containing the DNA, the -- the sperm of this particular individual. And she did not know that.",
  "She didn't just say, I got something back from the lab, and I relied on whatever that said. No, she said what she had gotten back from the lab, and she did not know, of her personal knowledge, that it was what she said it was.",
  "She didn't know if they had incompetent people there. The last case we had involving this kind of an issue, the reason they didn't bring in the lab technician to testify was that he had been fired in the interim for some reason which we didn't know, but it was pretty clear why -- why he would not have been a very good witness. We don't know how good this lab was. We don't know how good the individuals who did the test were. And that's why it's up to the State to bring forward testimony saying what the lab did. And the only testimony they brought forward was the testimony of this witness who was not there.",
  "If she said that, I would agree with you. But she said more than that. She said, I relied on material provided by Cellmark which is.... And then she described what that material was, and she had no personal knowledge of that.",
  "No, but Cellmark says this is the male DNA that was found in the sample that was sent. Cellmark made that decision, right? And her testimony was based upon the fact -- was based upon comparing that male DNA with -- with her own blood sample. It's meaningless unless that male DNA was indeed the defendant's.",
  "You know, I would believe that if the prosecution put the question to -- to her this way: Assume that you got a report which said that this was the defendant's DNA. And if you were to match that with this -- the work you've done on the blood sample, would you find that -- that, you know, that the sample was taken from the defendant? And she would say yes. And the jury would say: So what? I mean, you've just -- you've just made a hypothesis. \"If you had been told.\" That -- that would be worth nothing. Her testimony was, I received information that this was indeed the DNA taken from -- the male DNA taken from the -- from the swab that was sent. Without that, the testimony was worthless. It's just, you know, a hypothesis. She responds to a hypothesis. That was not the way this was played out in the trial, was it?",
  "She was asked, just -- just to be clear what she was testifying to: \"Did you compare the semen that had been identified by Brian Hapack from the vaginal swabs of Latonia Jackson to the male DNA profile that had been identified by Karen Kooi from the blood of Sandy Williams?\" \"Yes, I did.\" She is accepting and -- and affirming this statement that what she was comparing was the semen that had been identified from the vaginal swabs.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, that seems to me -- I mean, we have a Confrontation Clause which requires that the witnesses against the defendant appear and testify personally. And -- and the crucial evidence here is the testing of the semen found on the swab. That is -- that's the crux of this evidence. And you're telling me that this Confrontation Clause allows you to simply say, well, we're not going to bring in the person who did the test; we're simply going to say this is a reliable lab. I don't know how that complies with the Confrontation Clause.",
  "What was the instruction here? That --",
  "So, we simply have a presumption even though -- even though the court's statement seems to indicate that he does take it for the truth of the matter.",
  "And you're saying, well, he couldn't have because that would be against the law.",
  "Why is deference due? I mean, it's either the fact or it's not the fact. If a State supreme court opinion says something that contradicts the -- you know, the record, we owe it deference? I don't know any such rule.",
  "We owe deference to its interpretation of Illinois law, I suppose.",
  "I think we should give it deference where deference is due and not give it deference where deference is not due. And on statement of facts that either are erroneous or not, I don't -- I don't know why deference is applicable.",
  "I -- I'm not comfortable with that. I mean, it depends on how -- how broad it is?",
  "What about up to 700? Is that okay?",
  "I mean, how are we supposed to apply that kind of a rule?",
  "Above -- above 830 or below 830? Which?",
  "It just seems to me not a -- not a patent rule that we could possibly apply.",
  "Doesn't -- doesn't any -- any medical patent rely on natural processes? I mean, even if you invent a new drug, what that new drug does is -- is natural. It affects the -- the human physiognomy --",
  "-- in a certain natural way.",
  "Is it -- is it therefore precluded from patentability?",
  "What's different here?",
  "Well, that's another one of your arguments, but one of your arguments says you can't patent nature.",
  "Right.",
  "And that relates to the question that I asked.",
  "And tell me why you can't patent nature, then?",
  "Excuse me. Does that render it nonpatentable because it's not novel? Is that the reason why it -- it renders it nonpatentable?",
  "That's not what we're talking about here; we're not talking about novelty, are we?",
  "But once you say \"conventional nature,\" you're saying it's not novel. If -- if the step is not conventional, it's okay. Why?",
  "Because it's novel.",
  "What if -- what if you -- what if they just split up the patent? They -- they got one patent number for arthritis, another patent number for transplants, another patent number for each one of the autoimmune diseases you're talking about?",
  "Would each of them be okay, because it's --",
  "What about the --",
  "What about the discovery of a new physical change in the body caused by an old drug? You -- you find that it affects another part of the human system. Is it -- is that discovery patentable?",
  "Suppose somebody thinks you're wrong, that the numbers you've come up with are wrong. And they want to develop better numbers that will -- will help the medical profession. Your patent excludes them from doing that, right?",
  "No?",
  "All right.",
  "He says the solution to that is -- your saying their patent is not useful.",
  "That would be your defense.",
  "And it shouldn't matter whether it's 2.8 miles or 1 mile, right?",
  "I mean, if the land is nonnavigable -- if the river at that point is nonnavigable, it's nonnavigable.",
  "That's what we're talking about --",
  "-- the title purpose. I don't see why there ought to be any de minimis exception.",
  "It's an international boundary.",
  "I think -- I thought it's also an international boundary --",
  "-- as to which there is a different rule.",
  "For what purpose? Were they -- were they -- were we answering the question for the same purpose, or were we asking it for purposes of whether Federal regulation could extend to the whole river? For that purpose, it's easy to say if the whole river is, you know, used for commerce, the Federal Government can regulate even those portions of the river that are nonnavigable, that have -- but that have to be portaged around. But that's a different question from who -- who owns title to the -- to the bed under the portions that have to be portaged.",
  "But -- but they're closed where they're -- they're impassable for ships anyway. They're closed. What do you mean, remain open?",
  "You've -- you've got falls. You got waterfalls. You got rapids. What does it mean to -- to be sure that that river remains open to commerce? Commerce is impossible over it.",
  "The question is, has it held that? Do you have a case where it would have made a difference?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, if this is such an understood and traditional rule, why -- why didn't Montana make its rights known earlier when these private owners bought the land? Indeed, the State gave them condemnation power to flood adjacent lands so that they could build their dams.",
  "And you say while all this was going on, well, of course, everybody knew that Montana owned this land. And now they come back, what, a hundred years later, and they not only want to get the land back, they want to tax them for their use of it over -- over all these hundred years.",
  "That's extraordinary.",
  "I thought you say it doesn't belong to the private individuals. I thought you said it belongs to the United States if it doesn't belong to the State.",
  "Well, there you are. And you think the United States is going to keep off these fishermen?",
  "But you think they're wrong, right?",
  "Right.",
  "You're willing to concede on behalf of the State that if we find that the State does not have ownership of the bed, the State does not have regulatory jurisdiction for all of these purposes that you're now describing?",
  "Well, then your argument doesn't carry much weight.",
  "Well, you have sovereignty over the land owned, owned by other private persons.",
  "Could the United States demand compensation?",
  "For the riverbed? For the riverbed land --",
  "Of course, there would have been a daily fine with or without the compliance order, wouldn't there, if they were indeed in violation of the -- the Act?",
  "It seems to me there - - there's another distinction, a more significant one, between routine inspections by fire marshals or -- or restaurant inspectors, and that is that if you -- if you disobey their order, you're not subjected to any more substantial liability than -- than you would have been subjected to had they not issued the order. It isn't the order that -- that produces any -- any new fine, is it?",
  "What -- what do you care? I mean, you have the fines, don't you? So, why don't you just argue that? Why do we have to wrestle with the more difficult situation where there are no fines? It's conceded that there are fines, isn't it?",
  "So, you know, sufficient unto the day the evil thereof. We don't have to consider more difficult cases. But, as I understand it, you can get review by applying for an after-the-fact permit from the Corps, and the only -- the only expense you would incur in order to get that would be to fill in, as the order requires you to do, which is something like, what, $27,500 or so?",
  "Is that such a hard -- a hard hit? That's a lot less than, you know, 37.5 a day.",
  "Well, but their challenge to the compliance order is simply that they don't have wetlands. It's the jurisdiction of the EPA. And surely that can be raised in the -- before the Corps of Engineers, no?",
  "How long does it take to get one of those after-the-fact permits?",
  "Do they issue permits when there are no wetlands? I thought it was a permit allowing you to do something on wetlands which otherwise would -- would not be allowed?",
  "So, if they decide that there's -- that it's not a wetland, what do they -- what do they do? They do nothing? Is that it?",
  "Well, wait, wait. Surely, you wouldn't go in and -- and try to fight arbitrary or capricious. It's arbitrary or capricious or otherwise in violation of the law. Wouldn't you go in and say that this is in violation of the law?",
  "I don't think that one standard of review would do you very much good, to tell you the truth. They've thought about this. Maybe they got it wrong, but to say it's arbitrary or capricious, you're going to lose.",
  "This wouldn't be a problem if -- if this procedure were not employed, if there were not this -- this prior compliance order that issues before actual suit by the -- by EPA to hold you liable for violating the Act. Then you'd just have one -- one suit, and the -- the issue would be clear as to what burden the agency has to sustain. But it's -- it's really the dual nature of this process that creates the difficulty, isn't it?",
  "But that's in the statute. The agency didn't make that up, right? The statute provides for compliance orders, and it calls them \"compliance orders,\" doesn't it?",
  "Of course, you know, you're -- you're not going to be out of the woods. Even if you get this APA review, okay, some of the factual questions that go to whether these are wetlands or not are going to be decided giving substantial deference to the agency's determination of the facts, right?",
  "And so, even if you lose on that, you might still think you can win when the EPA finally brings a -- a civil action seeking to impose a penalty, where the burden will be on the EPA without - - without any deference to its factfinding. So, you still won't know where you are, will you?",
  "You've lost one, but you may win the other. You'll have to roll the dice.",
  "Well, your order could have read, it could have read -- \"Notice is hereby given that violation of or failure to comply with the foregoing Order\" -- cap \"O\" -- \"may subject Respondents to, one, civil penalties\" of up to 32.5 -- now 37.5 per day. That's how it reads. It could have read: Violation of or failure to comply with the Environmental Protection Act may subject Respondents to civil penalties. It's quite specific that it is violation of -- failure to comply with the foregoing order, which includes not letting -- filling in immediately and so forth. It says what it says. It's the violation of the order that -- that the additional penalties are attached to.",
  "It could -- it could as a theoretical matter double the penalties.",
  "You're just saying, as a practical matter, it doesn't often do that.",
  "I'm not going to bet my house on that.",
  "What about those provisions of the original order? I must say I was not edified by the fact that, when litigation was threatened or actually brought, the EPA modified its order: Oh, you don't have to plant the trees. Does it do this as a matter of practice, issue compliance orders that go well beyond what the - - what the EPA would -- would demand?",
  "Well, that's very nice.",
  "That's very nice, when you've received something called a compliance order, which says you'll -- you're subject to penalties of 32.5 for every day of violation.",
  "But it shows the high-handedness of the agency, it seems to me, putting in there stuff that is simply not required by the EPA.",
  "Suppose the Corps of Engineers agrees that it's not a wetland, and its basis for refusing to issue the permit is we don't give a permit; you don't need a permit.",
  "Is that binding on - -",
  "-- the Environmental Protection Agency?",
  "Can -- can the EPA issue a warning instead of using this -- this order procedure? Compliance order procedure?",
  "So, they could just -- just dispense with this compliance order and tell the Sacketts, in our view, this is a warning; we believe you're in violation of the Act; and you'll be subject to -- you are subject to penalties of 37.5 per day for that violation; and to remedy the violation, in our judgment, you have to fill in and you have to plant, you know, pine trees on the lot. It could do that?",
  "And there would be no review of that.",
  "Can't you usually obtain a declaratory judgment if prosecution is threatened and you think that there is no basis for it, and you can't -- you're not -- you're not compelled to just stand there and wait for the prosecutor to -- to drop the hammer? Can't you normally bring a declaratory judgment action saying there's no basis for prosecution?",
  "Well, in -- maybe with an informal warning, but when you have something as formal as this which shows that the agency does intend to prosecute, why wouldn't you be able to bring a declaratory judgment action?",
  "Yes, but maybe the agency is only entitled to deference when in fact it has made a record. When it hasn't made a record, maybe there's no reason to give it deference.",
  "But they'll just issue warnings, is what they'll do.",
  "Can you only get a 145 proceeding when you have new evidence?",
  "Suppose I have no new evidence and -- and I want to challenge. Can I bring a 145?",
  "Right.",
  "And on what basis does the court decide the case? De novo?",
  "Yes.",
  "How close a predecessor is the predecessor?",
  "Your case is stronger if it isn't new facts, right? That's what you'd say.",
  "Your case is stronger if in fact it's only new argument and not new fact.",
  "Yes, but you have a strange statute here. I don't know any statute that -- that reads this way. \"As the facts\" -- \"as the facts\" - - where is it? \"As the facts may\" - -",
  "\"As the facts in the case may appear.\" That's - -",
  "I had thought, Mr. Clement, that -- that one of your objections was that in deciding whether they're using the benchmark or the -- the legislature's proposed new plan, whichever one they're using, they -- in drawing up their own plan, they assumed the validity of all of the challenges. Is -- is that not the case?",
  "It's not just discretion. It's political discretion. That's what's troublesome about it. And you -- it seems to me the Government makes -- takes an absolutist approach to the proposition that you cannot use an un-precleared plan for any purpose. All the law says is that you cannot apply a precleared plan. The plan being applied here is not the Texas legislature's plan; it's the plan -- a remedial plan adopted by Federal judges. And to say that they cannot use in drawing up that plan the legislature's last political decisions seems to me not required by the mere prohibition against implementing that plan as the plan of the legislature. What would you do if -- if the district court in Washington and the district court in Texas - - neither one of them acts in time, and it's too late? It's too late to have any -- any primaries anymore. What -- what would happen?",
  "What would happen? You can't use the old plan. You have this absolute rule against using the new plan. What happens? You disenfranchise every voter in Texas - -",
  "-- because there may be some voters in Texas, may be, some who will be prejudiced by using the current plan? I suggest in that situation there's nothing to do but use the Texas plan.",
  "You acknowledge that there are some situations in which you can use the very plan that the Texas legislature adopted, even though it's not been precleared?",
  "So, it's no longer an absolute rule. So, the question is whether this is another reasonable exception to a non-absolute rule.",
  "Exclude me from the second. I'm not sure that -- that I've gone along on that, as you phrased it. The way you phrase it, you say they cannot even make the kind of preliminary inquiry that - - that your friend suggests.",
  "But that is not the current State policy. The benchmark plan is gone. It's old. The Texas legislature now has a different policy, and that, you say, should be ignored.",
  "Now, what's -- there's a presumption of its invalidity. You can't presume it valid, but you can presume it invalid.",
  "Well, not either way. You're presuming it invalid.",
  "Drawn as? Drawn as - -",
  "-- a coalition?",
  "All right.",
  "One of -- one of the basic rules that -- that was followed in drawing up the court plan was not to divide any voting districts, right?",
  "Why? Why did the -- that certainly is not a principle that the Texas legislature agrees with.",
  "So, the court just made it up?",
  "Go back from June 26th. Where does -- where does that leave us?",
  "June, May, April. It's the end of March. Right?",
  "And when do you expect the D.C. court to finish?",
  "Why -- why shouldn't it be inverted the way your friend suggests?",
  "A material new assessment?",
  "Okay.",
  "That's -- we're talking about money here, right?",
  "Okay.",
  "Do you concede that it's going to make them better off? I would -- I would assume that that's your principal objection. They don't know whether this new assessment is indeed going to be divided the way the original one was or not. They might want to challenge - -",
  "-- whether -- whether it's all going to be used for -- for assessable activities or not. And they have no -- you're telling me they have no - -",
  "At the very least, they have to make a -- an interest-free loan to the -- to the union until such time as they can challenge it.",
  "I assume we wouldn't need a Hudson notice at all, if -- if bishops affirmed all of these things, right?",
  "Isn't -- isn't the premise of Hudson that you give the notice before, before -- you receive the notice before you have to cough up the money?",
  "And what's now proposed is, well, for -- if there's an additional assessment, you cough up the money first, and then later you straighten it out. And I -- do you get -- do you get the interest?",
  "Mr. Young, I hope this won't use up much of your time, but I do have a pressing question to make sure that we're just not spinning our wheels here. What if the union here had simply said all this additional assessment will go to bargaining activities, and then simply used its original assessment, the portion that had been anticipated to be used for bargaining, for political activities? It could do that, couldn't it?",
  "I mean, it's not committed to -- to, you know, an 80-20, or whatever the division is, simply because that's what's given out in the first notice. It can indeed use its -- the anticipated portion for bargaining for political activities.",
  "So, why are we wasting our time? I mean, all the unions are going to do is say this is a general assessment for bargaining purposes, and then use their -- their general funds for the political thing.",
  "Okay. So, you win, and it'll never happen again. It'll never again be called a segregated fund for politics.",
  "That's one of their arguments. I mean, another one is that you haven't defined it precisely enough, right?",
  "That's a separate -- really a separate argument.",
  "They have their own guidelines that generally prohibit it, don't they?",
  "Sign -- sign me up as supporting Justice Kennedy's notion that this has a symbolic value, just as we require a certain modicum of dress for the people that attend this Court and the people that attend other Federal courts. It's a symbolic matter. And if this is – if these are public airwaves, the government is entitled to insist upon a certain modicum of decency. I'm not sure it even has to relate to juveniles, to tell you the truth.",
  "Well, you do more and more.",
  "You do more and more, since there's so --",
  "-- since there's so much of it on.",
  "Yes, that's right.",
  "Well, that's not really clear. I mean, if you want us to be really clear, you should ask the FCC to simply outlaw any fleeting use of the \"F\" word, the \"S\" word, any -- any shots of any nudity in any movie, buttocks included. That would give you all of the notice that you need. Why don't you propose that? Boy, that's certain as can be.",
  "What you acknowledge to be the vulgarity of cable suggests otherwise, doesn't it?",
  "How many displays -- how many displays of nudity were there that -- that went unsanctioned?",
  "Yes, well, I mean, if there are very few, it's not a very powerful argument.",
  "Me neither.",
  "Maybe the third is you shouldn't interview these people.",
  "You're talking about the legislative record here?",
  "Is that a closed record? Is that a closed record, the way a record of a case is?",
  "I just find it a strange expression to talk about \"in the record\" - -",
  "-- when what you're talking about is legislative history.",
  "It seems to me that - -",
  "-- that the two parties are at extremes and that there is indeed something in the middle. I mean, you say it has to be the determination of entitlement to compensation by the agency. The other side says no, it's just entitlement, whether it's been decreed or not. Why -- why wouldn't it be an award, however, if it was the employer that voluntarily paid the amount due, which is what he's supposed to do anyway, right? Why wouldn't that be an award of compensation?",
  "Yes, a sense that -- that the text would bear, as opposed to the -- to the sense that the other side argues here.",
  "Where -- well, I wish you would submit the sections of the Act that use it that way, that say \"compensation without an award.\"",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, it's - -",
  "No, he doesn't. No, he doesn't. He can just begin payment. This (c), which is the section we're talking about here, doesn't just provide for newly awarded compensation. It also says \"survivors currently receiving compensation for permanent total disability or death benefits.\" \"Currently receiving.\" Now, does that mean it has to have been decreed by the agency? I don't think so.",
  "That clause.",
  "Yes.",
  "I understand. But it - - but it applies to the question, it seems to me, that Justice Ginsburg asked, doesn't it?",
  "No?",
  "But only if you've been receiving compensation.",
  "Okay? If neither the employment -- if neither the employer gives you the compensation voluntarily nor as you -- as you contend, there has been an award by the agency, you're out; (c) doesn't apply. Right?",
  "How else would it apply? You are either receiving compensation, which I would understand to mean receiving it from the employer or by reason of an award, or else you've been newly awarded compensation, which I guess means it hasn't yet been paid, but -- but you have the award in your pocket.",
  "It doesn't say that, counsel. It says \"survivors currently receiving compensation.\" It doesn't say \"by virtue of an award.\" It says \"receiving compensation.\" So, if the employer is paying it voluntarily, you're in there. And then it goes on and it contrasts with receiving compensation those newly awarded compensation. You're not yet receiving it, but you've been awarded it.",
  "I understand that.",
  "But I'm just trying to make sense out of the provision. And it doesn't seem to me to make any sense unless you read it just the way I suggested.",
  "It doesn't say that. It says nothing about an award. The last part talks about an award. It says \"currently receiving compensation for permanent total disability or death benefits.\" And if you're receiving it from your employer, I don't know why that isn't covered by that. Why isn't it covered?",
  "Yes.",
  "I don't think it affects your case. It's just a matter of understanding what this provision is talking about.",
  "But if the employer has been paying voluntarily, you don't penalize the employee for not having an award, right? I mean he's in the same position; the employer has conceded the liability.",
  "I don't understand why that's so only for employment -- for employer payments and not the case for awards. If that's so for the employer's payment, why isn't it so for awards that have been decreed? Why don't they change every year?",
  "Okay. So, then my reading makes perfect sense.",
  "You don't really have to establish that, do you? All you have to establish is that it is -- there is no way in which \"newly awarded compensation\" means entitlement to compensation. That's all you have to establish.",
  "You don't have to show that it's used consistently throughout, only that it's never used to mean entitlement to compensation.",
  "Counsel, if I understood your response to my prior line of questioning, you deny that they are treated differently. The one who is receiving compensation is treated the same, under the same provision. There are two parts to it: survivors currently receiving compensation and survivors newly awarded compensation. Those two classes are treated exactly the same. The only one that is treated differently is somebody who is neither being paid by the employer nor has yet received an award.",
  "No?",
  "I see. Partial disability, in other words.",
  "Okay.",
  "Counsel, it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I mean, it seems to me you have to acknowledge it would be a much better statute had it been written differently. And really your argument here is it's not up to us to revise the inadequacies of a statute. I mean, your argument is you just can't read the language that way. And it provides a stupid result. There are such things as stupid statutes, and this is one of them, right?",
  "Counsel, could I - -",
  "Could I ask you about another inconsistency in this section? We've gone over one, which I think is there. Isn't there a group left out of this thing, even under -- even under the Government's interpretation of it? What happens to people who are receiving compensation for temporary total disability or for partial disability? They don't -- they don't come under either one of those two categories, even under the Government's interpretation, right?",
  "No, they haven't gotten an award yet. They have not gotten an award yet, and they are only partially disabled or have temporary permanent disability. They're -- they're not covered by (c), are they?",
  "Oh, that's right, but they - -",
  "It doesn't take effect - -",
  "-- during that year.",
  "Well, does that make any sense?",
  "No, it doesn't. But you say the statute doesn't make sense.",
  "Well, you're -- you're making your case harder than it has to be, it seems to me, by saying that it always means an award of compensation by the agency. I -- I think in -- in 8(d), I don't think it means that, but it certainly means an amount due and not an entitlement. It means an amount, a specific amount due, and that explains its meaning elsewhere, but that's quite different from saying that it means entitlement.",
  "Oh, I think that's true, but only because of the earlier portion of 6(c) which - - which covers all other payments that are not by virtue of an award.",
  "Receiving compensation.",
  "Your - -",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "But we're not talking - -",
  "-- about how the scheme works. Grant you that it makes a lot more sense your way, but you -- will you grant that it's not up to us to rewrite the statute?",
  "Okay.",
  "So, what we're talking about is whether \"awarded\" in that provision can bear the meaning that you want to give it. Let's assume that Congress passes a -- a new statute providing for tax credits for -- for each child, okay? My wife gives birth to a child just before Christmas, and I say, oh, goody; I've been awarded $2,000. I wouldn't say that. That's not a normal use of the language.",
  "I am entitled to it under this statute. But when the event of having a child occurs, I don't say I've been awarded $2,000. You might say it analogously. I mean, you know, oh, hey, I've been awarded $2,000. But that's analogous. And statutes are not written by analogy; they're written to say what they say. And I don't know anybody that would use the term \"awarded\" the way you want it used. The Chief Justice's example is another one: Oh, good, I've been awarded damages. You haven't been awarded damages. You're entitled to them.",
  "Let's go through those.",
  "And you -- you show me how -- I agree with you that they don't mean the entry of an award by the agency, but I don't agree with you that the only -- only reading you can give them is entitlement.",
  "I'm sorry. Give me a minute. Give me a minute.",
  "The language is important, isn't it?",
  "Okay. What page?",
  "Okay. Got it.",
  "And the language is?",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Oh, yes. Yes.",
  "That's -- that's true. And what that means is that it can be considered an award if you've gotten it from the employer voluntarily. That is still an award of compensation. That's all that that last sentence proves.",
  "Oh, yes. Yes. I agree he's wrong.",
  "No, no, no. I think he's persuaded me that in -- in the section we're talking about, subsection (c), the only meaning left for \"award\" is an award by the agency, because - -",
  "But -- but you have to show me one other provision at least where the only meaning you can give \"award\" is entitlement to money.",
  "(h)(1)?",
  "\"Upward adjustments to\" - -",
  "-- \"compensation to which\" - -",
  "Right.",
  "What -- what does \"awarded compensation at less than the maximum rate\" mean? I'm not sure what that refers to.",
  "Right.",
  "Aren't you entitled to get the maximum? No?",
  "I got you.",
  "Yes.",
  "You're right. It doesn't make sense. It - -",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "Yes, well, I -- I agree with that. You can speak of the statute as awarding something. But when you use the phrase \"newly awarded,\" you're not referring to the enactment of the statute; you're referring to the time at which the person qualifies under the statute. And I don't know any usage of that sort, that a person -- well, you know, when my wife has a baby, I've been awarded money. You haven't been awarded money.",
  "Yes, that's what you say. But I don't know -- I don't know any common usage that employs the term - -",
  "Give me your example again of \"award\" used as \"entitlement.\"",
  "No, no, no. Not from the statute.",
  "You -- you gave - -",
  "That wasn't -- you gave another example.",
  "No, not a case.",
  "Just an example you made up out of your fertile imagination which - -",
  "-- which seemed to me pretty good. But I forgot it. I'll get - -",
  "I'll get it from the transcript.",
  "Yes, but I -- I didn't say in that opinion that the -- the employer in -- in that -- or whoever it was that was entitled under the statute -- was \"newly awarded\" it. I agree the statute awards it, but when you say somebody is \"newly awarded,\" you're talking about an event at that time. And that's - -",
  "That's a different usage.",
  "So -- so, independent counsel would not be covered. I mean, if you have, you know, a counsel appointed because -- to show that the administration is disinterested in this prosecution and you get independent counsel, the Attorney General says: I will not interfere with him. The President says: I will not interfere with him. Then him you can -- you can sue without any immunity, right?",
  "Why? He's not working in close coordination. He's not subject to supervision. The whole purpose of an independent counsel is to eliminate supervision.",
  "Excuse me. Weren't the prison guards who were -- who were suable in Richardson -- weren't they suable under 1983 as acting under color of law?",
  "Well, the whole issue would have been a nonissue if they -- if they couldn't be sued.",
  "Yes.",
  "Don't you think the -- the two should go pari passu, as we say, that if you can be sued for acting under color of law, you ought to have the defenses that people who are acting with legal authority have?",
  "You seem - -",
  "You seem to assume or to acknowledge or to concede that market forces do not operate for government employment, that all government employees are doing it out of love, that - -",
  "I mean, why does market force eliminate this defense for somebody who's an employee of a private company but not for somebody who's an employee of the government?",
  "Year-long employment is not employment? If I accepted a government job for only a year, I'm not a government employee? I don't understand that.",
  "He's working as an employee. He's hired for 1 year. It's a 1-year contract. Why -- why does that make him not an employee? Or is it the fact that he's a lawyer? And all lawyers have a certain independent responsibility. They can't do some things that government superiors might tell them to do, right? So, are you going to say all lawyers are -- are -- cannot plead qualified immunity?",
  "It makes it even easier then. I -- I thought the attorney thing would help you, but if he's not even functioning as an attorney, he's functioning as a government investigator.",
  "Okay.",
  "But if they had employed him for a year, exclusive employment, no other clients, you'd say that's a different case?",
  "No, I'm saying a year; in fact, 364 days.",
  "Okay? And the deal was you're -- you're going to work for us and nobody else. You have no other clients.",
  "Yes, I understand that. How do you look at them?",
  "Does that come out -- case come out the same way or not?",
  "Everybody takes a position to make money for profit. How many government employees work for free?",
  "No, he's not. He's not - - I mean, yes, he may be, I guess. But assume he's not. He's just a lawyer who's been hired for 364 days to work for nobody but the -- but the government. And you still say that he has no -- no immunity in what he does.",
  "To investigate for the government.",
  "Two years, though? Three years? I'm a lawyer who - -",
  "-- enters a contract for life with this -- with this government to investigate. At that point, does he get the immunity?",
  "Still not?",
  "You should say section 1983 didn't exist. That's your answer - -",
  "-- to that one, right?",
  "Well, I understand that there is a lot of bad, cowardly legal advice being given in the Ninth Circuit.",
  "I don't really know that, but you don't know the opposite, either, do you?",
  "And -- and the rule about malice being -- being the criterion of liability, that applied not just to -- not just to private lawyers but to government lawyers as well, didn't it?",
  "So, if we're going to be historically faithful, we should deny any qualified immunity to government lawyers or expand the government immunity to -- for government lawyers so they can do anything so long as it's not malicious?",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "So, the devil with history, right?",
  "What if I told you that all the lawyers at the Department of Justice are regarded as being employed at will and that all of them can be fired?",
  "Do you think the rest of them don't -- don't have any protection?",
  "Wow. That's going to be disappointing news for all those attorneys at Justice - -",
  "You don't want to say that.",
  "Yes, but if -- if he did the same thing for a private company -- he could do the same thing for a private company, say, you know, you're going to get fired unless you substantiate your story by bringing the stuff out of your house. That wouldn't be a search -- an unlawful search; right? It could have happened in a private company.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, there's very little that is uniquely governmental. I mean, my goodness, if we denied immunity to -- to all those acts that are not uniquely governmental, there would be very little immunity, I'm afraid.",
  "Yes, but once -- once we resolve an ambiguity in a statute, that's the law, and the agency cannot issue a -- a regulation that changes the law just because, going in, the language was ambiguous.",
  "Yes, but our job is not to plumb Congress's psyche and decide what they had in mind. It's to interpret the statute. And if, as you acknowledge, it's a pretty obscure way to change the law from what we said it was, the law that's written there, that's a very obscure way to change it. I'm inclined to think that the law stays the way it was.",
  "So, this language would have one meaning if the very same language were adopted after our decision in -- in Colony and a different meaning if it were adopted, as it was, before our decision in Colony.",
  "That's a very strange approach to a -- to the meaning of a statute, it seems to me.",
  "Well, by far? By a little maybe, and I might agree with that, but -- but we're not writing on a blank slate here.",
  "Indeed, I think Colony may well have been wrong, but there it is. It's -- it's the law, and it said that that language meant a certain thing. And the issue is whether this is -- this change is enough to change the meaning of the statute. And - - and I'm dubious about that.",
  "If - -",
  "No, and if it is - - according to Brand X, if it specifically addressed the question and said that there was no ambiguity. But according to Brand X, if there's ambiguity, despite a holding of this Court, the agency can effectively overrule a holding by a regulation, right? Isn't that what Brand X says?",
  "So, the only question here is, as the Chief Justice put it, whether -- whether indeed Colony meant by \"ambiguous\" ambiguous.",
  "It depends on what the meaning of \"ambiguous\" is, right?",
  "I never thought that a revision of a statute of limitation was retroactive legislation, just as I've never thought that a provision altering rules of evidence for a crime, even for crimes that were committed before that alteration, is retroactive legislation.",
  "You know, the crucial date is the date -- at least it's not -- well, you can extend the statute of limitations.",
  "No, I - -",
  "So, say it's unfair, but I'm not sure that the rule against -- presumption against retroactivity technically applies.",
  "Mr. Bibas, I have -- this is almost a question of personal privilege. You -- you make your whole argument on the basis of Landgraf. So does the Government. You do not cite -- the Government cites but does not discuss the relevant portion of a - - of a later case which involved the same question, Republic of Austria v. Altmann. I concurred separately in Landgraf because I thought that the test that the Court was using, upsetting settled expectations, was indeed the proper test for constitutional provisions forbidding ex post facto laws, which is where the Court derived it from, Justice Story's opinion in a New Hampshire constitutional case. But I said in my concurrence that the proper test for -- for the other issue of retroactivity, namely, constitutionality aside, does this statute mean to be applied only in the future or in the past? And for that, I propose -- well, I'll read you what we said in Altmann: \"Our approach\" -- which postdates Landgraf. \"Our approach to retroactivity in this case thus parallels that advanced by Justice Scalia in the concurrence in Landgraf.\" Quote, and it's quoting the concurrence: \"'The critical issue ... is not whether the rule affects 'vested rights,' or governs substance or procedure, but rather what is the relevant activity that the rule regulates. Absent clear statement otherwise, only such relevant activity which occurs after the effective date of the statute is covered. Most statutes are meant to regulate primary conduct, and hence will not be applied in trials involving conduct that occurred before their effective date. But other statutes have a different purpose and therefore a different relative retroactivity event'\" -- \"'relevant retroactivity event.'\" And that is what we have here. The -- the event that is sought to be regulated is entry into the United States, and it is clear that this statute applies only to prospective entry into the United States. It doesn't apply to past entry so that those people who came in, in violation of this statute, can be deported. Now, why shouldn't we apply that rule in this case, as we did in the Republic of Austria case?",
  "Why would it be limited just to the foreign sovereign immunities context?",
  "Why do you say that's the majority's approach?",
  "Its -- its holding.",
  "But there are a lot of - - but there are a lot of statutes which we interpret to be valid, and not retroactive, which have a substantial effect. You can pass a statute altering the rules of evidence which have the effect of making someone who committed a prior murder convictable; whereas, before, he was not convictable. And we don't just look to the effect and say, well, it has that substantial effect; so, it's operating retroactively. We say, no, it's a rule of evidence. It applies in the future, and that evidence can come in. And that's my problem with this other approach. There are often adverse effects upon activities that occurred before the statute was enacted, but we still regard the statute as prospective only and, therefore, not subject to special rules for people who are affected.",
  "We're trying to figure out what Congress intended, right? We're not talking about constitutionality. We're talking about a rule that it's presumed that statutes are only prospective. All right? And your argument is the reasonable expectation of Congress when they passed this was that it would only apply to -- to people who, what, committed the crime or were convicted after the statute passed - -",
  "-- just as a matter of statutory interpretation?",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, I suppose you could say that there's a likelihood of quite inequitable enforcement if indeed you adopt a position we're going to pick up all of these people and send them away. That's not going to happen. It'll -- it'll be hit and miss. And, on the other hand, you can enforce it rigorously and equitably upon everyone if you only forbid reentry to those people who want to come back in and who have to, you know, give their names to Immigration, and you can check on -- on this status. That seems to me a sensible reason.",
  "Well, I -- I don't know. I think it would be prospective and unconstitutional because it's irrational. I mean, not everything that's unconstitutional is unconstitutional -- not everything that is unconstitutional is not prospective, it seems to -- or do you think that's so? If it's -- if it is unconstitutional in violation of the ex post facto law, the statute has to be -- has to be prospective. I'm sorry. Has to be assumed not to cover that prior conduct. Is that right?",
  "Okay. And if it does, it automatically has to be interpreted not to cover that?",
  "By reason of the presumption of expectation - -",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "Even -- even if you had pleaded guilty to spousal abuse?",
  "Yes.",
  "And you think Landgraf is clear and settled, and you're -- you're over there in Congress, and you say, boy, I know how this statute is going to come out under Landgraf - -",
  "-- better than I am.",
  "Well, that can be explained because Congress understands that who knows whether it's going to be held to be retroactive or not. If you -- if you surely want it to apply, you'd better say so. If that's the rule you want us to adopt, that's okay.",
  "I guess a child doesn't have any domicile except the parents'; right? Children who run away from home do not acquire new domiciles, do they?",
  "I suppose if they come with somebody else's 6-month-old child, they'd have to send that child back to China, too, wouldn't they?",
  "Which would be very sad, but that would be the law, right?",
  "They should not have sent him back to China, then. Why did they do that?",
  "Counsel, I can't hear you very well. Would you - -",
  "Can you crank up the thing or something?",
  "Thank you.",
  "Excuse me. That first one usually cuts against the immigrant, I would assume. So, if the parents knew, the child knows, and the child normally would not know, right?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, can you give any example -- the Government says you can't -- of an instance where status is imputed, not intent, but just status; where the status that the parents have is automatically given to the child or, for that matter, automatically taken away from the child?",
  "But there -- there, you - - what they're imputing is the intent to remain in the place, right? And that's -- that's an -- that's intent. That's imputing intent.",
  "And the child would not have been lawfully there but for the imputation of lawfulness from the parents.",
  "Why isn't it -- why isn't it an adequate reason that they've come up with here and in their decisions that the prior word was \"domicile\" and a child's domicile is that of the parents, and that the word under the new statute is \"residence\" and the child's residence is not necessarily the residence of the parent? That seems to me a perfectly valid reason.",
  "That may well be, but it's a different word.",
  "And the one word demands imputation; the other doesn't. So, I mean, I don't think you can say there's no -- no rational basis given by the agency.",
  "Excuse me. Was residence at issue in that case?",
  "Mr. Rothfeld, I'm -- I'm curious, how often -- this dispute here is simply about whether the Attorney General is permitted to cancel removal, right?",
  "How often does -- are applications for cancellation of removal granted? I mean, is it a common phenomenon, or are we really talking here about just spinning it out longer so that the -- so that the person who will ultimately be deported can stay here that much longer?",
  "You think it's as high as 40 percent?",
  "What do you respond to the point that lawfulness has been attributed, not just intent, but under the prior law, lawfulness was also attributed?",
  "Was that the case under the prior law?",
  "Yes, when -- yes.",
  "So, it's not unthinkable.",
  "Reaching all? I didn't understand you. You said it too fast. As reaching all -- something fees, whether permitted --",
  "Unearned fees whether provided or not.",
  "Well, I suppose if -- if the lower court could have been wrong for either one of two reasons, we don't have to decide which of the two we -- we're precluded from considering, right?",
  "I mean, it’s -- it would be just as well to say that the question presented here decides the case as it would be to say that the question raised by Justice Breyer decides the case, right?",
  "And is there any reason to put the one before the other?",
  "It could mean that, but it need not mean that. It could mean either that or just -- just part and not whole; and which of the two it means is often decided by the other words with which it's associated. I mean, if you have a phrase that says, you know, \"tacks, nails, and\" -- what? \"Tacks, nails, and wooden pegs,\" it's clear that \"nails\" doesn't mean toenails; it -- it means a fastener. And so, also here, when it says \"portion, split, or percentage,\" it seems to me the natural reading is that portion or percentage means not, as it could mean, the whole, but rather just a portion.",
  "That's not what we have. We have -- we have a statute that says you shall not take any portion or split.",
  "Okay?",
  "Give me an example of where the language \"give\" would have an effect.",
  "Have you deprived it of all effect?",
  "But nothing as big as this, if you accept HUD's interpretation of this, which is essentially the issuance of a -- of a price schedule by HUD, and anything above these prices is an overcharge and hence falls under -- under this provision. That's immense.",
  "No, but if we don't, then we reject deference to HUD, which you want us to -- to apply.",
  "We can't at one time -- at one and the same time, give deference to HUD and yet disagree with what HUD says.",
  "Well, but I assume that HUD's interpretation of a criminal statute like ours must give the defendant the benefit of the doubt so that if there's any ambiguity -- I mean, that's our standard rule. If there's a genuine ambiguity, you -- you find for the interpretation that favors the defendant. And this here -- I think this is at the very least ambiguous. And you are telling me -- well, I guess you're right. I guess HUD is favoring what would be the defendant in this case.",
  "Wait a minute. If -- you know, if -- if I charge you an exorbitant amount for cutting down a tree, you know, 2,000, $20,000, and then I present my bill, you would say that I have not earned it simply because it's exorbitant?",
  "I don't think you have to evaluate --",
  "Under the Respondent's interpretation, I don't think have you to evaluate the reasonableness of the fee in order to decide whether it was earned or not.",
  "I don't know anybody who -- any knowledgeable person who applies for a loan, who doesn't ask whether there are any points? I mean, it's standard mortgage practice. And somebody who says I'm going to get 8 percent? Yes. Eight percent with or without points? I mean, that -- I don't think that the mere fact that the interest rate was 8 percent means that you can't charge points and that any charging of points is -- is a charge for a service not performed. The service performed is giving you an 8 percent rate.",
  "Now, if she didn't want the points, she should have -- when it came to the closing, say what are these points for? The 8 percent is what you agreed to. And they would have said, well, that 8 percent is the -- is the rate we give when we charge 2 points.",
  "Yes, well, (a) -- the so-called kickback in (a) is not for services not actually performed. The referral -- the referral is certainly a service performed to the lender. There's -- there's nothing -- what should I say -- unethical about getting a fee for a referral. It's -- it's called a finder's fee. So, you know, under (a) a finder's fee is -- is made unlawful, right?",
  "And under (b), something quite different, and that is giving money to somebody who performs no service at all is made unlawful. And for that, you don't need an agreement, right?",
  "Is this 100 percent thing -- is this a real problem that Congress was addressing? Do you know of any 100 percent kickbacks or 100 percent payments to somebody else for services not performed as opposed to just keeping part and giving the rest?",
  "Isn't that enough reason for its not being addressed, that it's not a real problem?",
  "It made the decision that a finder's fee in this area, although in all other areas is perfectly okay, but a finder's fee in this area is a kickback.",
  "When an agency is construing a criminal statute, a statute providing for criminal penalties, do you think the agency is constrained to apply the rule of lenity and to assume that if there is ambiguity, it should be interpreted in favor of the defendant?",
  "But you concede that if we give it Chevron deference, you lose?",
  "No, on -- the case. If we give either the policy statement or the rule Chevron deference, you lose. Is that right?",
  "Ah. You want to talk to that?",
  "We don't give deference to interpretations that are beyond the limits of what the language will bear, do we?",
  "Could you complete your earlier answer? I was just waiting for your point, and it never came.",
  "Doesn't any agency have interpretive authority regarding the statute it's implementing?",
  "Is there agency that doesn't?",
  "Does it have to be specifically conferred?",
  "Is it at all increased when it's specifically conferred?",
  "We give deference to legal interpretations all the time.",
  "I have no idea. What -- I'm supposed to psychoanalyze Congress in every Chevron case?",
  "And under -- under (b), there doesn't have to be an agreement to pay -- under (b) there doesn't have to be an agreement to pay the title company for no work. It's just if it's a -- if it's a refinancing and the title company did the same title search, you know, 2 years ago, it says, heck, I'm not going to do it again, but it still gets the 10 percent, right?",
  "Even though there's no agreement to pay it for no work.",
  "They'd be liable under State law, I assume --",
  "-- for fraud, wouldn't they.",
  "Yes.",
  "It's wrong is your answer, right?",
  "Perhaps it was Dr. Johnson's answer when a lady pointed out an error in his dictionary, and his answer was: \"Stupidity, madam, sheer stupidity.\"",
  "Well, you didn't understand the question.",
  "Webster's Third, as I recall, is the dictionary that defines \"imply\" to mean \"infer\" --",
  "-- and \"infer\" to mean \"imply.\" It's not a very good dictionary.",
  "I thought we're -- I thought we're addressing not whether it's a good idea to give fees, but whether fees are payable under this particular statute, right? Which was enacted when?",

  "Have you ever seen a book, you know, translated from a foreign language, you know, \"War and Peace,\" you know, and you're at the mercy of what we call the translator, and it says on the fly page, you know, \"John Smith,\" comma, \"Trans.,\" period. Does it ever say \"John Smith,\" comma, \"Int.,\" period?",
  "No, it doesn't. It reflects that judgment only if you're right that \"interpreter\" means \"translator.\"",
  "I mean, you're begging the question. You could say that the one should embrace the other. But whether Congress thought that or not is mostly dependent on the language Congress used, isn't it?",
  "Well, I guess Black's Law Dictionary, which -- the editor of it is a -- is a co-author with me. So, I -- I feel obliged to spring to his defense.",
  "Since it is a law dictionary, presumably it ought to have taken into account the cases you're referring to, many of which use the word in -- in this sense, right?",
  "Garner.",
  "So, if there is no legislative history, there's no legislative history on the other side either, right? Saying that we -- we mean this to include translation.",
  "So, absent legislative history, I guess we have to rely on the words of the statute, right?",
  "Is it -- is it clear? Does anybody contend, does the other side contend, that the use of a viva voce translation outside of court is covered by the meaning of \"interpreter\" here? I assume that \"interpretation\" here meant interpretation in the oral proceeding that is the trial. And you're saying that if we hold against you, interpretation will still include all oral translations outside of the trial.",
  "Oh, at deposition, which I consider part of the -- part of the trial process, but not -- not in the lawyer's office where he asks somebody to sit down and -- and read this document to me.",
  "Well, that's the count. The jury takes lots of votes. Was it utterly clear that the jury could not go back and reconsider that? Unless that was absolutely clear, it seems to me a verdict had not been announced. She just said how we voted the last time.",
  "Excuse me. Excuse me. When you say she was announcing a decision, then you mean they can't go back on it?",
  "She was announcing a vote.",
  "But that -- so long as it's still tentative thoughts, it doesn't matter. The jury could have -- suppose the jury went back after this announcement -- you know, we -- you know, we've decided on a -- on the greater charge, or we voted on the greater charge for the defendant. Suppose they go back and one of the people who wants to convict on the lesser charge, as to which they are deadlocked, finally says, well, look it, if you won't come along to convict him on the lesser charge, by God, I'm not -- I'm not going to acquit on the greater charge. Isn't that the kind of stuff that goes on in jury rooms all the time?",
  "So, there is no certainty whatever that -- that what was the vote at that time would be the vote when they finally got done.",
  "Only if --",
  "Only if -- and I think this is the premise of your argument. Only if there is a constitutional necessity to -- to sever the various charges, there is a constitutional necessity to let the jury come in on one charge without coming in on the other. It seems to me that's the premise of your argument. And I don't know where that constitutional necessity comes from.",
  "Your manifest necessity depends upon the necessity of severing, yes. If you sever, then there is no manifest necessity of resubmitting the greater charge. But it assumes -- it assumes a severing, and I don't know where the severing comes from.",
  "You didn't finish your answer, did you? I thought you were going on to some other points.",

  "General McDaniel, how -- how probable is it that when the jury is polled, and having voted unanimously when they were back in the jury room, one of the members of the jury changes his mind and votes the other way? That's not at all probable, is it? But it happens sometimes, doesn't it?",
  "And when it happens, what's the result?",
  "Why is it much harder to define? I don't -- why does the broadness have anything to do with the breathing space? I mean, I suppose your argument here is that there is harm; it's not just falsehood, but it's falsehood conjoined with harm, just as libel is.",
  "Okay. So -- and in the example that Justice Ginsburg just gave -- in your case there's harm to those courageous men and women who receive the decorations. In the -- in the example that Justice Ginsburg gave, there's harm to the people who honorably served in the armed forces.",
  "Well, why isn't that just as -­",
  "Their service is demeaned when everybody says I served in the armed forces.",
  "I don't see any difference as far as that risk goes. I hope that in your earlier colloquy with Justice Kennedy, you -- you were not retreating from what our cases have repeatedly said, that there is no First Amendment value in falsehood.",

  "So, maybe we allow a certain amount of puffing in political speech as well.",
  "Nobody believes all that stuff, right?",
  "Did the Commander in Chief sign that -- that legislation?",
  "Well, sometimes the harm is just the impairment of governmental purposes, such as section 1001, which criminalizes the making of a false statement to any Federal agent, for Pete's sake. How do you justify that? Because the making of the false statement impairs a governmental investigation. And what is being urged here is that the making of this type of a false statement impairs the government's ability to honor valorous members of the armed forces.",
  "And do we give some deference to Congress as to whether there is a harm to governmental purposes, or do we make it up ourselves? When Congress passed this legislation, I assume it did so because it thought that the value of the awards that these courageous members of the armed forces were receiving was being demeaned and diminished.",
  "By charlatans. That's what Congress thought.",
  "Is that utterly unreasonable that we can't accept it?",
  "The government is going to hire people to follow, you know -- is that realistic?",
  "I mean, there is a sanction. You know, when there's a sanction in place, you think twice before you tell the lie. But if there's no sanction except you might be exposed, who's going to expose you? That sanction already exists, and there are a lot of people nonetheless who tell the lie. You really expect the government to hire investigators to go around the country outing people who falsely claim military honors?",
  "That's not going to happen.",
  "How about giving a medal of shame to those who have falsely claimed to have earned the medal of valor?",
  "I think that would be a good idea.",
  "Something of value. It has to be something of commercial value, right? It's -­ doing it just to -- just to obtain praise and the higher esteem of your fellow citizens, that's -- that's not enough.",
  "You have to get a penny out of it, right?",
  "What if he just gets the cheers of the crowd? He's up there. I'm a congressional Medal of -- the crowd cheers, and they give him a parade down Main Street. Is -- is that something of value?",
  "Are there a lot of cases raising the -- you know, the ambiguity that exists in this case? I mean, if you tell me that's all this case is about, I think we ought to dismiss this -- dismiss it as improvidently granted.",
  "We don't sit here to decide whether when the government says, you know, we do not concede it but we're not arguing it, or whatever the language was -- we don't sit to decide factual questions like that, that come up in a particular case. I thought we took this case to decide the more significant issue, on which there is a division in the lower courts, as to whether there is, as you say, power of the court to disregard the fact that a statute of limitations defense has not been raised. We all agree it wasn't raised. Now, whether it was forfeited or not is another question. If that's all you want us to decide, I don't want to decide that.",
  "Ms. Lord, an amicus brief filed on behalf of 15 States contends that the Civil -- the Rules of Civil Procedure are not what should be consulted here, because they govern only to the extent that they're not inconsistent with habeas rules, and asserts that the -- the habeas rules should rather apply and that they -- that they cut against your case. Do you have a response to that? Was it -- was it in your reply brief or --",
  "Didn't the State adhere to that?",
  "It kept its word, didn't it?",
  "You say you didn't abandon the right. Isn't that your position? You did not abandon it? You just --",
  "You just gave up the -- the opportunity to raise it yourself.",
  "Those are sunk costs, aren't they, Mr. Domenico?",
  "It's water over the dam, and the issue is whether the court of appeals will then have to repeat the district court's excursus into the merits.",
  "Right?",
  "And the court of appeals could have gotten mad at the fact that the district court was compelled to go through the merits, right?",
  "And for that reason could have denied it. But it didn't get mad, I guess. I don't know why.",
  "In -- in those cases, did the -- did the plaintiffs also have nonconstitutional claims which they were pursuing in the Federal Circuit?",
  "Yes, well, that's -- that's the problem here. I mean, yes, if all you have is a constitutional claim, I suppose the system you propose would work. You go to the district court. But where -- where you have both, it's a problem.",
  "Well, and whether that reason was justifiable. And isn't it the case that whenever the reason is an unconstitutional reason, you would have an as-applied challenge, right?",
  "So, why do you need a facial challenge in addition? I thought that we always try to do as-applied first and facial second. So, why isn't it enough that you can go to the Merit Systems Protection Board and then to the Federal Circuit saying that this action was wrong and not allowed under the statute? And -- and if -- if the reason it was wrong was that it was unconstitutional, what's -- what's the problem?",
  "And why is that wrong? It seems to me that's what the -- what the Administrative Procedure Act says, that if there is no other effective means of judicial review, you get judicial review under the APA.",
  "These people have no effective right because they can't go to the MSPB and can't go to the Federal Circuit. So, they have -- they have rights in the district court. That's not a problem. The problem is the people who do have rights to go to the Merit Systems Protection Board, right, who have constitutional claims based on -- on the unconstitutionality of a statute?",
  "Why?",
  "Yes, but that's -- that's entirely logical. Fausto in effect said that the statutory structure simply provides no cause of action for these people, okay?",
  "They're not entitled to anything. But I don't think that there's anything in the -- in the civil service laws that say these people are not entitled to constitutional protections. So, I don't think that -- that Fausto rules this out.",
  "Exactly.",
  "And it's those that I say that people not covered by appeals to the Merit Systems Protection Board -- they can bring those constitutional claims, even though they can't bring statutory claims.",
  "Yes. You're taking -- I'm saying that's true only with respect to those people who have no right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board. You're going further.",
  "And you're saying even the people who can appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, right, can go directly to the district court? That's a different question.",
  "Well, I will object. What is the agency -- taking evidence on an issue that it has no jurisdiction to decide? That is absolutely weird.",
  "I don't like that at all. That's ridiculous. Send it back to an agency that has no jurisdiction over the question, you know, make factfindings on this -- on this question over which you have no jurisdiction. Can you give any example where -- where that occurs elsewhere? Why wouldn't the -- the preferable course be to appoint a master, have the Federal Circuit appoint a master to do it?",
  "Yes, but -- but this is not an area that's within their expertise to decide. What do they know about -- about the military? And when is that ever -- ever relevant to anything that they decide? It's utterly irrelevant to their work. And you're telling them to take --",
  "Wait. You're -- you're actually proposing that you have to exhaust questions that the agency has no authority to decide?",
  "Curiouser and curiouser.",
  "If you don't bring before the agency a question that the agency says it has no authority to decide, you have forfeited your ability?",
  "Well, but -- but I find it difficult to understand why we -- we would not hold foreign sovereigns liable under this Act, that they're excluded despite -- despite its language; and yet, we cannot inquire whether persons other than sovereigns are covered. What is -- what is the distinction between the two?",
  "This is more specific than the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. It deals with a much more narrow category of case. And I do not think that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act would be interpreted to eliminate the sovereign's liability, if indeed this statute provided for it.",
  "Yes.",
  "But it -- I didn't understand the point you just made, that the sovereign immunity part goes to? To the conduct?",
  "Why doesn't the corporate thing go precisely to the same question?",
  "Congress could -- could pass a statute to that effect.",
  "Yes.",
  "The issue is whether this did it or not.",
  "What's your position --",
  "What's your position on aiding and abetting? Is that -- is that a matter of our domestic law or would we track international law on that?",

  "Really? Congress got it from Judge Edwards? Gee, I -- my goodness.",
  "I'll bet you none of them -- none of them even read that opinion.",
  "That is a strange phrase, \"honest services,\" as -- you know, as a crime, deprivation of honest services. But the word \"individual\" is not a strange --",
  "-- word at all. It's used all the time.",
  "It means an individual.",
  "Is that -- is that better for you or worse for you?",
  "Well, suppose I'm a member of the House or of the Senate, and I'm not a member of the committee that engages in all of this legislative history. And I -- I see the word \"individual\" in this statute, and that's the basis on which I vote for or against a statute. Why should I be saddled with whatever sayings by members of the committee or by experts testifying before the committee occurred? It was out of my hearing. I voted for \"individual.\" And \"individual\" -- well -- if Congress wanted \"individual\" to mean what you say it doesn't mean, what word would they have used instead? I mean, if \"individual\" is a code word for person, what's the code word for individual?",
  "Maybe organizations opposed it.",
  "Maybe organizations opposed the extension of the legislation to themselves. Is that conceivable?",
  "And is Congress ever influenced by -- by such lobbying?",
  "You don't find lobbying in the legislative history.",
  "But it's an explanation. You say there's no possible explanation.",
  "I can imagine that corporations would have been quite upset by this notion.",
  "This is the dog that did not bark, right? Legislation cannot mean what it says unless the legislative history says that it means what it says. Right?",
  "Mr. Fisher, you -- it seems to me you misrepresent our jurisprudence when you insist that \"individual\" has to have only that meaning. That's not what our jurisprudence says. We say that we give words their usual meaning, their common meaning. Even though they may sometimes be used in a different fashion, it's the usual or common meaning that we apply.",
  "Many cases to that effect.",
  "We say it all the time.",
  "I -- I find it hard enough to parse the statute without having to parse Father Drinan's testimony. I mean --",

  "Is it possible?",
  "Is it possible that it's just -- that it's a stupid statute?",

  "Have we ever decided an equal protection case on the basis that the -- the State who had violated the -- the Constitution can't afford to pay for it? Is there any case that supports that?",
  "It's just too expensive?",
  "And, therefore, we have to deny equal protection?",
  "You don't believe in the administrative nightmare exception to the Equal Protection Clause?",
  "Because you would -- you would eliminate all litigation on Equal Protection Clause grounds if all that the plaintiff is going to achieve is not any benefit to him but harming somebody else. That's -- the classic case is -- is the sex discrimination case, where a State had a drinking law which said that -- that men could drink at the age of 18 but women at the age of 21. And what happened in the lawsuit? Did the court say, well, I guess -- I guess men will be able to drink at 18. No, that's -­",
  "They said men would have to drink at 18, not that women will have to wait to 21 because -­",
  "But here -- here the State has defined the class. That's the difference. I mean, to say employers with less than eight is a separate class, that's fine. But -- but here, the State said we're creating this class of -- of people who have to pay for sewer assessments, and we're going to treat them equally. That's what the law required.",
  "So, you're saying that any future law which -- which disregards an equal classification that a prior law established is okay? So long as it's a future law that does it.",
  "There will always be a future law that does it.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's what we're questioning.",
  "I don't understand that. Why? I mean, people paid the lump sum.",

  "My impression is that, I'm not sure it's by statute, but just by judicial decision, a child born in the marriage is a child of the marriage unless -- unless the child is repudiated by -- by the father.",
  "Well, you rely only on that -- on that definition. The section is entitled \"Old-age and survivors insurance benefit payments,\" and it also provides in (d) that a child is entitled to the benefits if, among other things, (C) was dependent upon such individual, (i) if such individual is living at the time that the application was filed, (ii) if such individual has died at the time of death, or (iii) if such individual had a period of disability, et cetera, et cetera. It seems to me -- is the word \"survivor\" used anywhere in the text of this statute except in the -- in the heading of this section?",
  "We use titles to determine the meaning of ambiguous provisions later, don't we?",
  "Nor would -- nor would he meet the requirements of (C), would he? Would he meet any of the requirements of (C)? Of (d)(1)(C).",
  "Then what does -- what does (d)(1)(C) do if it's all washed out by --",
  "Well, it doesn’s say – it says every child as defined in 416(e) has to meet that requirement. If such -- such child, the one defined in (e).",
  "Could you -- go ahead and finish.",
  "Counsel, I now have in front of me (h)(3). I don't see how it has anything to do with whether the child was dependent under (d)(1)(C). Why do you think it has something to do with that?",
  "Well, unless such individual was not living with or contributing to the support of such child -- which is certainly the case here; the child had not yet been born -- and other qualifications. The principal condition does not exist. Shall be deemed dependent upon his father or adopting father unless at such time such individual, mother or father or adopted father was not living with or contributing to the support of such child. How does that alter the dependency requirement of (d)(1)(C)?",
  "Well, that may well be.",
  "If that is ambiguous, why doesn't -- why doesn't (d)(1)(C), despite -- what is it (h)(3) or whatever the 3 we're -- we've been playing with here -- despite (d)(3), despite that, it seems to me that they don't meet that requirement.",
  "I don't -- I don't -- look, when Congress says \"child,\" \"child\" means child, and the mere fact that Congress wrote that at an age when most children were indeed children of married people doesn't change the word \"child.\" I mean, we don't go back and say -- Congress often uses words that go beyond what -- what their immediate concern is, and here they used the word \"child.\"",
  "You want us to probe their mind and say, well, since 90 percent of all children were children of married people, that's what they must have meant by \"child.\" I just don't think that follows at all. \"Child\" means child.",
  "Oh, it disfavors children who are born after the father has died, which is in accord with the title of the statute: survivors benefits.",
  "What's issue here -- what's at issue here is not whether children that have been born through artificial insemination get benefits. It's whether children who are born after the father's death get -- get benefits.",
  "I haven't found the sentence you're talking about. Where is it?",
  "Bottom of what? Page what?",
  "Mr. --",
  "Mr. Rothfeld, I know that the Government didn't rely on it, but just to satisfy my curiosity, how -- how can this child satisfy the requirements of (d)(1)(C), with regard to dependency upon the father?",
  "I understand. But --",
  "-- that is connected with this other issue.",
  "Was that jury trial constitutionally required?",
  "Well, you have to do that because you have to know whether -- whether to impanel a jury before the -- before the jury comes in or before the jury comes in with a penalty, right?",
  "The most -- the most you must read out of it.",
  "Yes. You could -- you could say it could have meant -- they could have thought that they violated every day.",
  "You can't say that for sure. But one thing you can say for sure is that they found that it violated it 1 day.",
  "Isn't that precisely what Apprendi said? Is --",
  "Yes.",
  "This was -- you're not arguing that this rule will apply only to fines against corporations? It would also apply to individuals, right?",
  "It's up to the judge to decide how many days or what the value was and so forth. Right?",
  "So, the right to trial by jury to have that very important fact found does not exist, even for individuals?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, let's talk about Tyler. Tyler was not argued before this Court.",
  "It's a one-page opinion. It's later described quite accurately as focusing not upon the amount of the fine, but rather upon a misdescription of pot ashes as pearl ashes, right?",
  "That's right.",
  "Quite so.",
  "The jury did find it in Tyler, though, didn't it? The question was submitted to the jury, wasn't it?",
  "Why doesn't -- why doesn't that indicate what the historical practice was?",
  "Did it -- as a matter of statutory construction, right?",
  "Right.",
  "You -- you don't think they believed in the Apprendi doctrine, either, right?",
  "Might have helped if they had argument, right?",
  "What about all of the 19th-century cases cited by Justice Thomas's concurrence in Apprendi? Fine cases.",
  "In which course -- in which courts did indeed require the amount of the fines to be found by the jury.",
  "Massachusetts, right.",
  "Was it an argued case, at least?",
  "If it's varied and complicated, why should we -- assuming that it's ambiguous, why should we adopt the strange rule that the jury has to find the fact if you go to jail for 2 weeks, but doesn't have to find the fact if the amount of fines multiplied by number of days or by anything else will -- will make a pauper of you? Why would we adopt such a strange rule?",
  "Unless compelled to do -- to do so by a clear common law history?",
  "What if the judge disagreed with the jury about whether there was even a violation?",
  "No, no, no, no. The jury finds a violation, but the judge thinks the jury got it wrong.",
  "How does -- how does he pick the -- the number of days? He flips a coin?",
  "No, he finds, you know, they could have come out that way, but -- but they were wrong.",
  "That's the whole problem. That is indeed the whole problem.",
  "The judge doesn't have to find that this defendant beyond a reasonable doubt committed the violation on so many days. The jury would.",
  "The judge can simply say, well, you know, all in all, probably they did it -- probably. More likely than not they did it so many days. It's a big difference.",
  "What if you call it a misdemeanor but -- but impose a very heavy fine? It's still a misdemeanor?",
  "And you don't have right to counsel. Right?",
  "So --",
  "Yes. I guess you don't need counsel on any suits against corporations, right?",
  "What about 50 years? Is that -- is that too much?",
  "Well, you know, once -- once you depart from the principle that we've enunciated that death is different, why is life without parole categorically different from 60 years or 70 years or -- you know, you'd be back here next term with a 60-year sentence?",
  "Okay.",
  "Good.",
  "I'll change my -- I'll change my question to 50 years without possibility of parole.",
  "Then you have no -- no distinction, right?",
  "Without --",
  "How about 15 years old? 15, 60 years; or 14, 70 years?",
  "What -- what's the distinction between 14 and 15?",
  "I understand, but how are we -- how are we to know where to draw those lines? We can't do it on the basis of any historical tradition, certainly.",
  "The common law left it up to the jury to take account of the youthfulness of the offender.",
  "They're all entitled to jury trial, right --",
  "-- before they're --",
  "You mean we --",
  "How -- how do I come to that decision? What do I -- just consult my own preferences on this matter? Something like 39 States allow it. I mean, the American people, you know, have decided that that's the rule. They allow it. And the Federal Government allows it. So, I'm supposed to impose my -- my judgment on -- on what seems to be a consensus of the American people?",
  "Well, that's not going to help me, you know.",
  "Well, I thought that modern penology has abandoned that rehabilitation thing, and they -- they no longer call prisons reformatories or whatever, and punishment is the -- is the criterion now. Deserved punishment for crime.",
  "Now, if that's the criterion, is everything that you say irrelevant?",
  "Let's assume I don't believe in rehabilitation, as I think sentencing authorities nowadays do not. Both at the Federal and the State levels, it's been made clear.",
  "So -- so, it may not be realistic to speak of mandatory life without parole. It's only mandatory if the youth is convicted of the highest charge brought, but it remains within the power of the jury, in light of the youth, to convict him of a -- of a lesser offense which would not produce mandatory life imprisonment without parole.",
  "Gee-whiz. You know, I was beginning to agree with you --",
  "-- about this case, because I thought you were appealing to what the American people think about the line or maybe to the common law. Now, the common law had a rule of -- of the age of reason. I think below 12, you couldn't -- at least you couldn't impose the death penalty. Maybe you couldn't even convict for a felony. But you just pluck some number out of the air.",
  "Why can't I pluck a number out of the air if you pluck one out of the air?",
  "Do you have any reason to think that juveniles are any better than anyone else as far as learning from prison is concerned? I mean, recidivism is a big problem, isn't it? People who've been to prison go out and commit the same crimes again, don't they?",
  "Is there any reason to think that juveniles are any different?",
  "What if, instead of striking down the laws in these States, why don't we just require the State legislatures to think about it? All right? And -- and then see how many think about it, and -- and come up with, you know, something that agrees with you or doesn't agree with you.",
  "Wouldn't that be more democratic somehow?",
  "You haven't changed your mind in the interim, have you?",
  "Are you -- are you saying that it doesn't matter that the verdict would have been the same by this jury if the error had not been made? You're --",
  "You're saying that the test is whether it contributed to the verdict, and if it did, it doesn't matter whether the same verdict would have been pronounced absent that evidence?",
  "Well, then, what is harmless error? Every error is harmful. Every error that's -- that's there contributes to the verdict. There's no such thing as harmless error.",
  "What -- what does that mean? To say that it doesn't substantially impact the verdict means the verdict would have been the same despite this evidence. But you're saying, no, that's not the test; you have to ask whether it contributed to the verdict. The Government says, well, it did, but the verdict would have been the same anyway. That's what harmless error is, it seems to me.",
  "Mr. Yang, why does any of this have to do with her credibility? Did the dissent say that the way this affected the jury was that it rendered her less credible? I thought --",
  "-- that the dissent just said it's bad to tell the jury that even the defendant thought he was guilty -- or even the defendant's lawyer thought he was going to lose.",
  "Do they have to give -- at least when you stop a car, the test is whether there was probable cause, not whether that was the reason that the officer stopped the car.",
  "There was a broken taillight. There existed probable cause, whether that was the basis on which he acted or not. Now -- is it any different when --",
  "With respect to an arrest?",
  "So long as they have good reason for an arrest, it doesn't matter.",
  "Is it different? You -- you acknowledge that prosecutors always prosecute, that they never exercise discretion and say, oh, what the heck, you know?",
  "All the time. All the time. I don't know that it's any less frequent than -- than an officer deciding not to arrest.",
  "Why is there any difference if -- when ordinary policemen are policing an authorized demonstration --",
  "-- in front of this Court or anywhere for that matter? The people making the demonstration have -- have the same motivation and can make the same assertion of, oh, the only reason you arrested me was because you didn't like what I was -- what I was talking about. So, why should that situation be different?",
  "What -- what about for crowd control? You want to extend it to crowd control as well. What difference does the First Amendment make there?",
  "That's an assault, isn't it?",
  "All it takes for an assault is an unwanted touching.",
  "It's not incidental if you reach out and touch somebody on the shoulder or the arm.",
  "That's fine, and he didn't -- he doubtless didn't consider those contacts hostile. But when somebody tells you \"I think your policies are disgusting\" --",
  "I mean, just don't tell me that it's -- it's not a crime. It is an assault if it's an unwanted touching.",
  "And it wouldn't be a violation of the First Amendment if they only did that because they didn't like the ideas he was expressing?",
  "Wouldn't that be a violation of the First Amendment?",
  "Even though they're doing it for -- they do it for a racial reason, would that be okay?",
  "Of course not. I don't see how your -- your First Amendment exception doesn't apply to those things as well as to --",
  "-- to the arrest.",
  "It's not a conclusion. I mean, if -- if he didn't have the bumper sticker and you asserted in the pleading he stopped me because he knows I hate the police, that's a conclusion. But if you have the bumper sticker, he says, you know, I had the bumper sticker, and that's why he stopped me.",
  "Again, I don't understand why you -- why you say that they're immune from the charge of First Amendment retaliation for that but not immune from the charge of First Amendment -- I mean --",
  "If you say they're doing it on First Amendment grounds for the one, they're doing it on the First Amendment grounds for the other. Why is either one okay?",
  "Well, we lost a couple of Presidents, didn't we?",
  "Well, that depends, as - - as the Government points out, on whether that directive is a directive to the Secretary of the Treasury as to how he goes about getting this penalty, or rather a directive to him and to the courts. All of the other directives there seem to me to be addressed to the Secretary. Why should this one be directed to the courts? When you say \"in the same manner,\" he goes about doing it in the same manner, but the courts simply accept that -- that manner of proceeding but nonetheless adjudicate the cases.",
  "Well, he's assessing and collecting it in the same manner as a tax.",
  "Mr. Long, I don't think you're going to come up with any, but I think your response is you could say that about any jurisdictional rule. If it's not jurisdictional, what's going to happen is you're going to have an intelligent Federal court deciding whether you're going to make an exception, and there will be no parade of horribles because all Federal courts are intelligent.",
  "So, it seems to me it's a question you can't answer. It's a question which asks why should there be any jurisdictional rules? And you think there should be.",
  "There's at least some doubt about it, Mr. Long, for the reasons that Justice Breyer said, and I thought that we had a -- a principle that ousters of jurisdiction are narrowly construed; that, unless it's clear, courts are not deprived of jurisdiction. And I find it hard to think that this is clear. Whatever else it is, it's easy to think that it's not clear.",
  "Don't do it again, because I think that goes too far. I don't think that's restraining the collection of the tax. It's restraining the payment of the tax.",
  "You don't want to let that bone go, right?",
  "Why aren't those problems that the Federal Government can address directly?",
  "So, any self-purchasing? Anything I -- you know, if I'm in any market at all, my failure to purchase something in that market subjects me to regulation.",
  "Why do you -- why do you define the market that broadly? Health care. It may well be that everybody needs health care sooner or later, but not everybody needs a heart transplant. Not everybody needs a liver transplant. Why -- I mean --",
  "Could you define the market -- everybody has to buy food sooner or later. So, you define the market as food; therefore, everybody's in the market; therefore, you can make people buy broccoli.",
  "Well, is that a principled basis for distinguishing this from other situations? I mean, you know, you could also say, well, the person subject to this has blue eyes. That would indeed distinguish it from other situations.",
  "Is it a principled basis? I mean, it's -- it's a basis that explains why the government is doing this, but is it -- is it a basis which shows that this is not going beyond what -- what the system of enumerated powers allows the government to do.",
  "Mr. Verrilli, you could say that about buying a car. If people don't buy cars, the price that those who do buy cars pay will have to be higher. So, you can say in order to bring the price down, you're hurting these other people by not buying a car.",
  "That's not -- that's not what you're saying.",
  "I thought it was. I thought you're saying other people are going to have to pay more for insurance because you're not buying it.",
  "Well, don't obligate yourself to that. Why -- you know?",
  "No, you could do it. But does that expand your ability to issue mandates to – to the people?",
  "No, no, it's not. They all involved commerce. There was no doubt that what was being regulated was commerce. And here you're regulating somebody who isn’t commerce. By the way, I don't agree with you that the relevant market here is health care. You're not regulating health care. You're regulating insurance. It's the insurance market that you're addressing, and you're saying that some people who are not in it must be in it, and that's -- that's different from regulating in any manner commerce that already exists out there.",
  "Wait. That's -- it's both \"Necessary and Proper.\" What you just said addresses what's necessary. Yes, has to be reasonably adapted. Necessary does not mean essential, just reasonably adapted. But in addition to being necessary, it has to be proper. And we've held in two cases that something that was reasonably adapted was not proper, because it violated the sovereignty of the States, which was implicit in the constitutional structure. The argument here is that this also is -- may be necessary, but it's not proper, because it violates an equally evident principle in the Constitution, which is that the Federal Government is not supposed to be a government that has all powers, that it's supposed to be a government of limited powers. And that's what all this questioning has been about. What -- what is left? If the government can do this, what -- what else can it not do?",
  "But that -- no, that wasn't my point. That is not the only constitutional principle that exists.",
  "An equally evident constitutional principle is the principle that the Federal Government is a government of enumerated powers and that the vast majority of powers remain in the States and do not belong to the Federal Government. Do you acknowledge that that's a principle?",
  "Okay. And that's what we're talking about here.",
  "I don't understand your point. Whatever the States -­",
  "Whatever the States have chosen not to do, the Federal Government can do?",
  "I mean, the Tenth Amendment says the powers not given to the Federal Government are reserved, not just to the States, but to the States and the people.",
  "And the argument here is that the people were left to decide whether they want to buy insurance or not.",
  "Only if you make phone calls.",
  "These people not stupid. They're going to buy insurance later. They're young and need the money now.",
  "When they think they have a substantial risk of incurring high medical bills, they'll buy insurance, like the rest of us.",
  "I don't know why you think they're never going to buy it.",
  "You could solve that problem by simply not requiring the insurance company to sell it to somebody who has a condition that is going to require medical treatment, or at least not -- not require them to sell it to him at a rate that he sells it to healthy people. But you don't want to do that.",
  "It's a self-created problem.",
  "Whatever --",
  "-- problems Congress's economic regulation produces, whatever they are --",
  "-- Congress can do something to counteract them. Here, requiring somebody to enter -- to enter the insurance market.",
  "Can I tell you what the something else is so -- while you're answering it?",
  "The something else is everybody has to exercise, because there's no doubt that lack of exercise cause -- causes illness, and that causes health care costs to go up. So, the Federal Government says everybody has to join a -- an exercise club. That's the something else.",
  "Well, fees -- you know, license fees, fees for a hunting license -- everybody knows those are taxes. I mean, I don't think there's as much of a difference between a fee and a tax as there is between a penalty and a tax.",
  "The President said it wasn't a tax, didn't he?",
  "You're making two arguments. Number one, it's a tax. And, number two, even if it isn't a tax, it's within the taxing power. I'm just addressing the first.",
  "Is it a tax or not a tax? The President didn't think it was.",
  "So you're saying that all the discussion we had earlier about how this is one big uniform scheme and the Commerce Clause, blah, blah, blah, it really doesn't matter. This is a tax, and the Federal Government could simply have said, without all of the rest of this legislation, could simply have said everybody who doesn't buy health insurance at a certain age will be taxed so much money, right?",
  "Yes, but you didn't need that. GENERAL VERRILLI -- providing affordable coverage for --",
  "You didn't need that. If it's a tax, it's only to --",
  "Raising money is enough.",
  "Okay. Extraordinary.",
  "Answer those questions in inverse order.",
  "I would like hear you address Justice Breyer's other two principles.",
  "I think that's his point.",
  "There's such a thing as legislative inertia, isn't there?",
  "I mean - -",
  "Yes, I wanted to ask you about that. Why do we look to the -- are you sure we look to the intent of the Congress? I thought that, you know, sometimes Congress says that these provisions will -- all the provisions of this Act will be severable, and we ignore that when the Act really won't work, when the remaining provisions just won't work. Now, how can you square that reality with the proposition that what we're looking for here is what would this Congress have wanted?",
  "Yes, they sure do.",
  "That's true, but is it right?",
  "All right. The consequence of your proposition, would Congress have enacted it without this provision, okay, that's the consequence. That would mean that if we struck down nothing in this legislation but the -- what is it called -- the \"Corn Husker kickback,\" okay, we find that to violate the constitutional proscription of venality, okay?",
  "When we strike that down, it's clear that Congress would not have passed it without that. It was -- it was the means of getting the last necessary vote in the Senate. And you're telling us that the whole statute would fall because the Cornhusker kickback is bad. That can't be right.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, there are some provisions which nobody would have standing to challenge. If the provision is simply an expenditure of Federal money, it doesn't hurt anybody except the taxpayer, but the taxpayer doesn't have standing. That -- that just continues. Even though it is -- it should -- it is so closely allied to what's been struck down that it ought to go as well. But, nonetheless, that has to continue because there's nobody in the world that can challenge it. Can that possibly be the law?",
  "But those are provisions that have been legitimately enacted. The whole issue here is whether these related provisions have been legitimately enacted or whether they are so closely allied to one that has been held to be unconstitutional that they also have not been legitimately enacted. You can't compare that to -- to cases dealing with a statute that nobody denies is -- is constitutional.",
  "Mr. Kneedler - -",
  "-- don't you think it's unrealistic to say leave it to Congress, as though you're sending it back to Congress for Congress to consider it dispassionately, on balance, should we have this provision or should we not have provision? That's not what it's going to be. It's going to be these provisions are in effect, even though you -- a lot of you never wanted them to be in effect and you only voted for them because you wanted to get the heart of the - - of the Act, which has now been cut out. But, nonetheless, these provisions are the law, and you have to get the votes to overturn them. That's an enormously different question from whether you get the votes initially to put them into the law. What -- there is no way that this Court's decision is not going to distort the congressional process. Whether we strike it all down or leave some of it in place, the congressional process will never be the same. One way or another, Congress is going to have to reconsider this. And why isn't it better to have them reconsider it -- what should I say -- in toto, rather than having some things already in the law which you have to eliminate before you can move on to consider everything on balance?",
  "Mr. Kneedler, what happened to the Eighth Amendment? You really want us to go through these 2,700 pages?",
  "And do you really expect the Court to do that? Or do you expect us to give this function to our law clerks?",
  "Is this not totally unrealistic, that we're going to go through this enormous bill item by item and decide each one?",
  "I don't care whether it's easy for my clerks. I care whether it's easy for me.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, could I - - can you give us a prior case in -- that resembles this one in which we are asked to strike down what the other side says is the heart of the Act, and yet leave in - - as you request, leave in effect the rest of it? Have we ever -- most of our severability cases, you know, involve one little aspect of the Act, and the question is whether the rest. When have we ever really struck down what was the main purpose of the Act and left the rest in effect? Do you have a case for that?",
  "I think the reason -- the reason the majority said that was that they didn't think that what was essential to the Act was what had been stricken down, and that is the -- the ability of the judge to say on his own what -- what the punishment would be. I don't think that's a case where we struck -- where we excised the heart of the statute. You have another one?",
  "There is no example. This is really - -",
  "Is this really a case of first impression?",
  "I don't know another case where we have been confronted with this -- with this decision. Can you take out the heart of the Act and leave everything else in place?",
  "Have a conference committee report afterwards, maybe.",
  "Anticipation of the minimum coverage. That's going to bankrupt the insurance companies, if not the States, unless this minimum coverage provision comes into effect.",
  "But many people might not -- many of the people in Congress might not have voted for those provisions if the central part of this statute was not adopted.",
  "I mean, you know, you're - - to say that we're effectuating the intent of Congress is just unrealistic. Once you've cut the guts out of it, who knows, who knows which of them were really desired by Congress on their own and which ones weren't?",
  "Excuse me. Why do you say -- I didn't follow that. Why?",
  "Why would their rates be lower?",
  "There is nothing about Federal support that is unsustainable, right? That is infinite.",
  "Is there any dictionary that gives that - -",
  "-- that definition of \"essential\"? It's very imaginative.",
  "Just give me one dictionary.",
  "How do we know that? When people speak, I assume they're speaking English.",
  "Mr. Farr, let's consider how -- how your approach, severing as little as possible, thereby increases the deference that we're showing to Congress. It seems to me it puts Congress in this position: This Act is still in full effect. There is going to be this deficit that used to be made up by the mandatory coverage provision. All that money has to come from somewhere. You can't repeal the rest of the Act because you're not going to get 60 votes in the Senate to repeal the rest. It's not a matter of enacting a new Act. You got to get 60 votes to repeal it. So, the rest of the Act is going to be the law. So, you're just put to the choice of, I guess, bankrupting insurance companies and the whole system comes tumbling down, or else enacting a Federal subsidy program to the insurance companies, which is what the insurance companies would like, I'm sure. Do you really think that that is somehow showing deference to Congress and respecting the democratic process? It seems to me it's a gross distortion of it.",
  "No, I -- that wouldn't be my approach. My approach would say, if you take the heart out of the statute, the statute's gone. That enables Congress to do what it wants in the usual fashion. And it doesn't inject us into the process of saying: This is good, this is bad, this is good, this is bad.",
  "It seems to me it reduces our options the most and increases Congress's the most.",
  "Why put -- why put Congress to that false choice?",
  "You know -- you only have two choices, Congress. You can have the whole bill or you can have -- you can have parts of the bill or no bill at all. Why that false choice?",
  "Mr. Clement --",
  "-- do -- do you agree -- do you agree that the government has to act reasonably?",
  "Do -- do we strike down unreasonable statutes? My God!",
  "The Executive has to act reasonably, that's certain, in implementing a statute; but if the statute says, in so many words, that the Secretary can strike the whole -- funding for the whole program, that's the law, unreasonable or not, isn't it?",
  "Mr. Clement, I didn't take the time to figure this out, but maybe you did. Is there any chance that all 26 States opposing it have Republican governors, and all of the States supporting it have Democratic governors? Is that possible?",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "What are your second and third? I'm on pins and needles to hear your second --",
  "Mr. Clement, the Chief has said I can ask this.",
  "As -- as I recall your -- your theory, it is that to determine whether something is coercive, you look to only one side, how much you're threatened with losing or offered to receive. And the other side doesn't matter. I don't think that's realistic. I mean, I think, you know, the -- the old Jack Benny thing, your money or your life, and, you know, he says, \"I'm thinking, I'm thinking.\" It's -- it's funny, because it's no choice. You know? Your life? Again, it's just money. It's an easy choice. No coercion, right? I mean -- right? Now, whereas, if -- if the choice were your life or your wife's, that's a lot harder. Now, is it -- is it coercive in both situations?",
  "Really?",
  "It's a tough choice. And -- and --",
  "No, no, no. To say -- to say you're -- when you say you're coerced, it means you've been -- you've been given an offer you can't refuse. Okay? You can't refuse your money or your life. But your life or your wife's, I could refuse that one.",
  "No, I'm talking about my life. I'd say take mine, you know?",
  "How could we use that example? Forget about it.",
  "What do you think we --",
  "-- meant in -- in those -- those dicta in -- in several prior cases, where we've said that the Federal Government cannot be coercive through the Spending Clause? What -- what do you think we were -- give -- give us a hypothetical.",
  "Okay.",
  "But anything else, so long as you --",
  "-- you have to have -- you're talking about situations where they have to locate their statehouse in some other city --",
  "-- and they have no choice. But short of that, they can make the State do anything at all?",
  "You can't imagine a case in which it is both germane and yet coercive, is what you're saying. There is no such case as far as you know.",
  "I wouldn't think that that's a surprise question. I mean, you know --",
  "Hey, I can't think of one. I'm not blaming you for not thinking of one.",
  "I would have thought there was a serious political strain -- constraint on the individual mandate, too, but that didn't work. What you call serious political constraints sometimes don't work.",
  "Of course not.",
  "The smaller it, is the bigger the coercion.",
  "The smaller what you're demanding of them, the bigger the coercion to go along.",
  "And who wins?",
  "Could never do it or wouldn't?",
  "It's your prediction. Okay.",
  "Are you willing to acknowledge that the Administrative Procedure Act is a limitation on the Secretary's ability to cut off all the funds; she can't do it if it -- if that would be unreasonable? Are you willing to accept that? I wouldn't if I were you.",
  "Indeed, part of the discretion is to cut off all of the funds. That's what the statute says, and I think --.",
  "I wouldn't worry a lot if I were you. I don't know of any case that, where the Secretary's discretion explicitly includes a certain act, we have held that, nevertheless, that act cannot be performed unless we think it reasonable. I don't know any case like that.",
  "Yes, when there's just a general grant of discretion, it has to be exercised reasonably. But maybe Justice Breyer knows such a case.",
  "All right. Give it to me.",
  "May it do so? Doesn't the question come down to this -- maybe you can answer this \"yes.\" But isn't the question simply: Is it conceivable to you, as it was evidently not to Congress, that any State would turn down this offer, that they can't refuse? Is it conceivable to you that any State would have said no to this program? Congress didn't think that, because some of its other provisions are based on the assumption that every single State will be in this thing.",
  "Now, do you -- can you conceive of a State saying no? And -- and if you can't, that sounds like coercion to me.",
  "So, what do you predict? If you predict the same, that 100 percent of the States will accept it, that sounds like coercion.",
  "They'd have to bail out of Medicaid, you're talking about --",
  "-- not just -- yes.",
  "Excuse me. I -- I don't agree that there's an agreement for transfer of title. Where there's a consignment, you give the property to somebody, and he says I will sell it to somebody if somebody will buy it.",
  "There is no agreement to transfer title.",
  "It's purely a future contingency. If someone will buy it, I will sell them -- sell it to that person on your account.",
  "I don't -- I don't understand what that is.",
  "What's an emergency service worker?",
  "Excuse me. They're not on duty all the time. Aren't -- don't they have hours of duty? My goodness. Some of them make enormous overtime wages because they've put in hours beyond their regular hours of duty --",
  "These people have no hours of duty.",
  "Congress can draw -- draw even silly lines.",
  "If Congress draws it, it's a line. But the line you're suggesting here -- both your brief and the Government's, as I recall, say, my goodness, if we find for the Respondent here, there'll be so much uncertainty in the future. I'm not sure there isn't a lot of uncertainty if we -- if we find in your direction. Now, let me give you an example. One of my law clerks -- my law clerks supplement my sparse life experience.",
  "One of my law clerks is familiar with the -- the framing business. Okay? Now, salesmen of frames do not sell the frames at the time that they visit the -- the framing company or the framing store. They get a commitment that in the future, that person will order from the framing company. Now, is that a sale?",
  "Well, but there is a commitment. There is a commitment to -- what they're trying to get is a commitment to consider this drug if it's appropriate for prescription to patients in the future. That's a commitment.",
  "It's a peculiar line of commerce. And -- and you're saying that what constitutes a sale -- a salesman cannot take account of the fact that this is a weird line of commerce, where you're selling to people who cannot make a commitment.",
  "Well, excuse me. Consignment salesmen are -- are not exempt?",
  "Excuse me. How can they put in number (2)? I -- I thought that 3(k) is 3(k). Can -- can they supplement 3(k)?",
  "What's the authority to do that?",
  "Well, that's wonderful. Then if you can go beyond 3(k), I guess really the question before us is whether it's arbitrary or capricious for the agency not to extend their -- their power to supplement 3(k) to this situation, which these people look like salesmen to me. And so, if they can do number (2) there, I don't know why -- why the agency couldn't say, oh, and by the way, detailers are also included.",
  "And the issue would be whether it's unreasonable for them not to say that.",
  "Sure there is; sure there is. But once you -- once you concede that it doesn't have to be within 3(k) and that it's within the power of the agency to grant the exemption anyway, then we really have a different -- a different argument before us here.",
  "Did we have detailers in 1940? Gee, that's a long time ago. Did we have detailers in 1940? That's almost a century ago.",
  "But this is part of a regular program that the agency has now instituted, to run around the country and file amicus briefs; is that it?",
  "Yes, right, to get -- instead of doing rulemaking, instead of doing adjudication, we're going to file amicus briefs, and the court will accept our view in that amicus brief and, hey, presto, we have -- we have made law.",
  "That's extraordinary.",
  "There are 90,000 of these people, and you have not -- the agency has not brought any action for these -- lo, these many years. Ninety thousand of them. And all of a sudden, you say -- you come in and say, oh, you have been in violation of the law in the past, and you're going to have to pay a lot of money for all these people that you didn't give overtime to in the past. I just think that's extraordinary.",
  "So, you have been guilty of malfeasance for 70 years, right? These 90,000 people out there who have been in violation of the law and the agency has done not a blessed thing?",
  "You don't suggest -- you're not arguing for a rule that if -- if an individual does not seek an opinion letter, he's guilty? Is that --",
  "You wouldn't -- you wouldn't mind being exempt as administrative, would you?",
  "Yes.",
  "But they've changed their -- their view.",
  "Consignment, for one, which is legitimate business.",
  "Mr. Clement, I wanted to ask you about section 501 of the regulations, which -- which is on page 4 of the appendix in the blue brief, and was mentioned in the -- in the Government's presentation. It says -- requires that the employee be engaged in (i) making sales within the meaning of 3(k); or (ii) obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities. What authorization is there for the agency to invent number (ii)?",
  "Well, which is it? I mean, you say, yes, yes, it's both.",
  "Pick one.",
  "Is it the transfer of title or a commitment?",
  "Ah. Okay.",
  "It's a finding of logic, for Pete's sake. These are prescriptions. You can only get a prescription from a doctor. Obviously, the number of prescriptions, drugs sold, depends upon the number of prescriptions given by doctors.",
  "That's a different point.",
  "It's not the point you were making.",
  "Excuse me. Is a fair implication enough? You're talking here about a repeal, essentially, of an earlier provision, section 109. And our cases uniformly say that it -- it has to be clear implication, unquestionable implication. Do you think this is really clear and unquestionable?",
  "I'm really troubled by \"fair implication\" -­",
  "How many -- how many cases do you have that say \"fair implication\" as opposed to quite a few that say \"clear and unquestionable implication\"? Marrero? Is that -- is that the one case you rely on?",
  "From a footnote in Marrero, right?",
  "Yes. Anything else?",
  "Marcello? Where -- what's the cite for that? I mean, there are a lot of earlier cases that make it clear when you're repealing a prior statute if it isn't express, it has to be at least a clear implication. And I'm -- I'm astounded to think that in a footnote, we're suddenly going to change that to simply \"fair implication.\"",
  "Well, that's a different question. And we can talk about that. But how did Marrero come out? Did it -- did it find an overruling or not?",
  "So, it did not find 109 overcome by fair implication, right?",
  "So, it's entirely dictum, right? And dictum in a footnote.",
  "I thought it was the other way. The holding was that 109 governed. No?",
  "I thought you said the holding was that section 109 governed, that it had not been repealed.",
  "Exactly. And, therefore, whatever it said about what is necessary for repeal of 109 was purely dictum, because it held that 109 was not repealed. So, even if fair implication was the test, it was not the test applied and determinative in the case. So, it's dictum. And dictum in a footnote.",
  "All right.",
  "Well, I'm not sure he's arguing that. I think he acknowledges, as our opinions say, that it can be done by implication, but it has to be clear and unmistakable implication. I think that's the position he's taking. Anyway, you want to tell me why this is clear and unmistakable?",
  "Exactly, and I think we would come out that way. I think you're entirely right. But the accelerated -- the direction to the Guidelines Commission to promulgate the guidelines on a -- on an emergency basis is not, as you just put it, for nothing. It has -­",
  "As Justice Alito was suggesting -­",
  "-- it has some effect.",
  "So, it -- it's not comparable to what you've just said.",
  "That's fine. But it -­ they apply that applicable law to those, as you say, admittedly few people who have been prosecuted, convicted, and are now being sentenced under that applicable law.",
  "There may not be many of them, but it does not -- it does not deprive that language of all meaning.",
  "Well, no, you're begging the question. The -- the law applicable to pre- -­ pre-statute offenses continues to be the prior law, and the applicable law to offenses that have occurred after the enactment date is the -­",
  "New guidelines to what people? That's the issue.",
  "If it's only new -- you're begging the question again.",
  "If it's -- if it's only to people who have committed their offenses after that Act, then you have one set of applicable guidelines for those people, and you leave in effect, for people who committed their offense before the -- the enactment date, the prior guidelines. I don't think there's anything necessarily implied by -- by this provision to the effect that -­",
  "-- there is only in the future one set of guidelines applied, you know, one guideline fits all. I don't think that's -­",
  "Excuse me. 30a?",
  "39a.",
  "What is section 3742(g), which is -­",
  "Okay. But I mean -- yes, that's very nice, but let's talk about text, not what about the emotions of Congress. This section that you quoted, (a) -- what, (4)(A)(ii) -­",
  "-- of section 3553(a) -­",
  "Is that in the new statute?",
  "It was in effect -­",
  "It was not the amendment.",
  "Congress didn't insert that -­",
  "-- when it made this amendment. You're just saying that that is the incidental effect of the provision that Congress did adopt?",
  "I would find that extraordinary, that they say it's racist, but we're going to leave in effect all of the sentences that have previously been -- been imposed. That seems to me very unlikely. Mr. Estrada, I would like you to explain the effect of 3553(a)(4)(A)(ii), which -- which does seem to -- to be sure, it's not in the new legislation, but it's the background against which the new legislation was adopted, and it seems to require that -- that the court use the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing.",
  "Of course, you could say that about any statute that runs afoul of -- of section 109. I mean, that's what section 109 says: Even though we have decided that this old law is bad and the penalty should be lesser, even though we've decided, when we do that, you continue to apply the bad old penalty to people who committed a crime before the amendment. Isn't that what 109 says?",
  "Didn't we have similar language in Cherokee Nation? Didn't we say that that language in Cherokee Nation, which was in the general appropriations statute, although not in each contract, didn't mean that the Secretary could refuse to pay?",
  "No, I don't mean the Appropriations Act. I mean -- I mean the general statute that governed this program.",
  "So why does it mean one thing there and mean something else when -- in the Appropriations Act?",
  "No, but -- but there wasn't in Ferris either. I mean, that was the problem. If the appropriations had been enough to cover that plus the later expenditures, there would have been no problem.",
  "Lawfully available subject to appropriations. I mean, it was subject to appropriations.",
  "That's not really relevant here anyway, is it?",
  "What I don't understand is why the language \"not to exceed\" is any different from Congress appropriating $900,000. You mean the world changes if -- if Congress, instead of just appropriating $900,000, authorizes the Secretary to expend not to exceed $900,000? Why --",
  "Well, I -- I would think $900,000 is pretty emphatic, if that's all you appropriate.",
  "I wish you would. I've lost the question.",
  "Ferris did not say, as I recall, that you can't expect the contractor to have notice that appropriations have been limited. It said you can't expect them to have notice as to how much of the expenditures under that appropriated act have been spent. Isn't that the only thing it required notice of?",
  "I would think, if you sign a contract, you better be sure that there are appropriations for it.",
  "Well, am I correct that what the government is arguing is that the fact that this limitation was included in the particular contract makes it different from Ferris?",
  "Which Ferris did not. Did the Ferris contract say that?",
  "Well, is it --",
  "Well, is it just a question of our creating a new rule, or rather, is the proposition whether the tribes, when they entered into this, should have realized that because of the peculiarity of these contracts that they had to be entered into, that the rule which otherwise would apply does not apply? It ought to be a question of expectation of the tribe, should it not?",
  "Do you think it protects these -- these unsophisticated tribes who don't know enough to sue by not allowing anybody to sue?",
  "Does that make their situation better somehow?",
  "Do you have to solve it contract by contract? Couldn't there be a -- a provision in the -- in the law which -- which says that, where appropriated funds are inadequate to cover the totality of -- of costs under this statute, it will be apportioned as follows?",
  "Or the Secretary will apportion it? That's all it would take. You wouldn't even have to do it contract by contract. Right?",
  "You would prefer contract by contract for your clients.",
  "Oh, absolutely --",
  "Could the -- could the judge say, when the proposal is made to him, the only way I can be sure that it is the indubitable equivalent is to have the sale open to credit bidding, which is what we always do? Can the judge say that?",
  "Now, you're, you're --",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Neff, can -- are you done? I'm sorry. I didn't want to stop your answer.",
  "Can I -- let's look at the text. Little (ii) provides for exactly what you want to do here. What you want to do under (iii) is precisely what (ii) says, except you want to eliminate, subject to Section 363(k) of this title, right? Does it -- does it make much sense for a provision to say you can do it three ways: number (i); number (ii), you can have this sale subject to credit bidding; and number (iii), after -- after saying that, specifically, oh, you can have this sale, not subject to credit bidding? That's -- that's not a very sensible statute. Why -- why go through that -- that problem of -- of saying number (ii), if you could have left it to number (iii) anyway?",
  "Yes.",
  "Mr. Neff, don't you feel sorry for the United States? The United States is often in the creditor situation, and the United States cannot come up with cash. Are they going to run to Congress and get an appropriation for each -- each security case it has? What -- what do you propose we do with the United States? The United States just can't take any security interests anymore or what?",
  "I -- I don't understand.",
  "But wouldn't the court always say, when -- when it's confronted with this situation, the government comes in, and the court says, yes, well, you know, I -- I guess that that price is probably so low because nobody could credit bid. I mean, wouldn't that always be a -- a frailty of whatever -- whatever price it sold for? Wouldn't it always be?",
  "Well, that might be, but -- you know, it doesn't -- it doesn't take a genius to figure out that if you allow people to bid for cash or for credit, you are going to get more bids and higher bids than -- than if you allow them to bid for cash only.",
  "That just means that you can't find a buyer who is willing to pay that much.",
  "I didn't realize the judge had to approve -­",
  "Yes.",
  "The judge has to approve the stalking horse?",
  "I -- say it again? I didn't -- I didn't understand that.",
  "They tried and failed to prove what?",
  "Cause.",
  "I lost you. I lost you.",
  "It's not just the requirements, but the exceptions to the requirements. What are you referring to?",
  "Big case for the government, Ms. Harrington, isn't it?",
  "It is a big case for the government.",
  "What you just said is, so long as they come in with some appraisals that are above what -- what the property sold at for cash, then it's not the indubitable equivalent?",
  "Because you've got to have at least one appraiser who says it's -- it's worth more. Is that all it takes?",
  "Indubitable is indubitable.",
  "If you have one honest appraiser who says --",
  "What -- what happens if you go to the judge and the judge says, there is one higher bid, so I can't say it's indubitable? Then what happens?",
  "Mr. Miller, you -- you claim on behalf of the government that the decision of whether to take the land into trust has nothing to do with the use to which the land will be put; wherefore, these plaintiffs who were complaining about the use to which it'll be put have no standing. If that is so, why did the government delay the taking into trust for 3 years while there was pending a lawsuit which would have prevented the use that the government intended the newly trusted land to be used for? You delayed for 3 years because there was a challenge to whether you could use -- whether this land could be used for what you call gaming and I call gambling. Why did you delay for 3 years if it's irrelevant?",
  "Well, wait. On what basis? On any basis other than - -",
  "Well, what environmental action consequences are there from the mere decision to take it into trust? Unless you know what it's going to be used for, you have no idea what the environmental consequences are.",
  "But the challenge was to -- was to the transfer, you say.",
  "Based in part on the use to which it was going to be put; right?",
  "Why not? Of course, it doesn't have to be within the interest, it just has to be arguably within the interest. That -- that adverb is left out in much of the discussion. But if, indeed, the use of the land is one of the elements to be considered in taking title, why isn't somebody who is affected by the proposed use within the zone of interest?",
  "You could put that it way, or you could put it that the injury comes from the government's taking title for gaming. Okay? You could put it that way as well.",
  "Inasmuch as the government always has a purpose in mind when it takes title.",
  "But the Act provides for that. The Act provides for that, right?",
  "Well, is -- is that in the -- is that in the Administrative Procedure Act? I thought the Administrative Procedure Act eliminates the -- the old bugaboo of sovereign immunity, and says when it -- when it will stand and when it won't.",
  "And if you're relying on the Quiet Title Act, that -- that clearly covers only suits which seek to say, I own the land rather than the government, and this is not such a suit. So I don't see why the normal APA principles wouldn't govern.",
  "No, but the relief to be sought under the Quiet Title Act is title in the plaintiff. That's the relief ultimately sought.",
  "Now, on the way to that, you may -- you may get some injunctive remedy, but the basis for the lawsuit is -- is not: I own the land.",
  "Relief in that kind of suit, yes.",
  "Relief in that kind of suit. But this is not that kind of suit.",
  "Excuse me. I guess I've lost you.",
  "Okay.",
  "You can say that again and again, counsel, but it does say \"under this section.\" And I don't -- I don't know how you get out from under that. It says \"under this section.\"",
  "And if this section applies only to suits seeking to assert title on the part of a plaintiff, it's not under this section.",
  "I thought you were going to answer how his -- his complaint constructively changed.",
  "I thought you were going to tell us how it constructively changed to be an action seeking to have a decree that title was in him, which is what the QTA covers.",
  "Okay.",
  "So even constructively, it hasn't turned into that.",
  "You -- you say the 30-day window only applies to quiet title actions.",
  "Surely -- surely the 30-day envisions comments by anybody, not just people who claim to own the property, doesn't it?",
  "I thought that -- maybe I'm wrong, but the government will correct me if I am. I thought the government concedes that a NEPA action could -- could be brought when the government is taking land to use for a particular use. Let's say it's -- it's taking land for a nuclear waste repository. Certainly, a NEPA action would -- would lie. You don't disagree with that, do you?",
  "You're supposed to say \"yes, sir, good.\"",
  "You're not -- you're answering the question with regard to an argument I don't think you've made and I don't think you would want to make. You're not asserting that the action can be brought anytime within 6 years after the government has already taken the land. You're just asserting that an action brought before the government takes the land does not change its character and become a quiet title action afterwards; right?",
  "You're not saying that anybody can bring within 6 years after the government's taking a suit, are you? I hope you're not arguing that.",
  "Thank you.",
  "I think you're right. I pushed you into it. It's my fault. You're right.",
  "Of course, the government can fix that. I mean, if this is indeed an inconvenient situation, that we think the government should not be in doubt for 6 years afterwards, I guess Congress can simply change it; right?",
  "Totally within the control of Congress. We -- we -- we don't have to make up some limitation to protect -- to protect the United States.",
  "Yes.",
  "What -- what about this as a reason? When you prevail in a quiet title action, the only way the government can get off the hook is to give you the land, if it's -- if it's within, what, the 6 years, or pay you money if it's after 6 years, but within 12. Whereas in your case, I suppose the government could moot the suit -- moot the suit, by simply disallowing gambling. Can the government do that?",
  "Once it has told the tribe that they can have -- I mean, this suit could be -- could go away so long as the tribe does not run a casino; isn't that right? That's your -- that's the gravamen of your complaint.",
  "So I guess you -- you could be a happy fellow if -- so long as the tribe doesn't build a casino. Whereas in -- in quiet title cases, the only way you can make a happy fellow out of the plaintiff is to give him the land.",
  "All right. Do you have any concern that the government will get hoist by its own petard? What your argument -- the conclusion to which your argument leads is that this individual, or any individual claiming that the government took title incorrectly, can sue under the Quiet Title Act, even if they don't claim that title was taken from them. Are you sure that's good for the government?",
  "Of course, that's not the only time the government takes land, right?",
  "Anyway, if this is a problem, is it -- is it an immigration law problem?",
  "Or is it a Fourth Amendment problem?",
  "Is the Government's attack on this that it violates the Fourth Amendment?",
  "So, you'll concede that the -- that the state has to accept within its borders all people who have no right to be there, that the Federal government has no interest in removing?",
  "That's -- that's all the statute -- and you call up the Federal government, and the Federal government -- yes, he's an illegal immigrant, but that's okay with us.",
  "And -- and the state has no power to -- to close its -- its borders to -- to people who have no right to be there?",
  "Well, all that means -- it gives authority over naturalization, which we've expanded to immigration. But all that means is that the government can set forth the rules concerning who belongs in this country. But if, in fact, somebody who does not belong in this country is in Arizona, Arizona has -- has no power? What -- what does sovereignty mean if it does not include the ability to defend your borders?",
  "But it's still up to the national government. Arizona is not trying to kick out anybody that the Federal government has not already said do not belong here. And the Constitution provides - - even -- even with respect to the Commerce Clause -- \"No state shall without the consent of Congress lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports except,\" it says, \"what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws.\" The Constitution recognizes that there is such a thing as state borders, and the states can police their borders, even to -- to the point of inspecting incoming shipments to exclude diseased material.",
  "Do you have any example where -- where enforcement discretion has the effect of preempting state action?",
  "I'm talking about another -- another case of ours where we've said that, essentially, the preemption of state law can occur, not by virtue of the Congress preempting, but because the executive doesn't want this law enforced so -- so rigorously, and that preempts the state from enforcing it vigorously. Do we have any case that says that?",
  "Well, they do that with all -- with all Federal criminal statutes. And you acknowledge that, as a general matter, states can enforce Federal criminal law, which is always entrusted to the Attorney General.",
  "Sounds like racial profiling to me.",
  "What does this have to do with Federal immigration law? I mean, it may have to do with -- with racial harassment, but I thought you weren't relying on that.",
  "Are you objecting to harassing the -- the people who have no business being here? Is that -- surely, you're -- you're not concerned about harassing them. They have been stopped anyway, and all you're doing is calling up to see if they are illegal immigrants or not. So you must be talking about other people who have nothing to do with -- with our immigration laws. Okay? Citizens and -- and other people, right?",
  "But that has nothing to do with the immigration law - -",
  "-- which is -- which is what you're asserting preempts all of this activity.",
  "Anyway, what -- what's wrong about the states enforcing Federal law? There is a Federal law against robbing Federal banks. Can it be made a state crime to rob those banks? I think it is.",
  "But does the Attorney General come in and say, you know, we might really only want to go after the professional bank robbers? If it's just an amateur bank robber, you know, we're -- we're going to let it go. And the state's interfering with our -- with our whole scheme here because it's prosecuting all these bank robbers.",
  "Now, would anybody listen to that argument?",
  "Of course not.",
  "Well, maybe 1306(a) ought to be amended, then. I mean, we have statutes out there that there a lot of people in violation of it and - - well, the Attorney General will take care of it. Is that how we write our criminal laws?",
  "Again, I ask you, do you have any other case in which the basis for preemption has been you are interfering with -- with the Attorney General's enforcement discretion?",
  "I think that's an extraordinary basis for saying that the state is preempted.",
  "It's not criminalizing anything that isn't criminal under Federal law.",
  "It's -- it's the bank. It's the Federal bank example - -",
  "-- a state law, which criminalizes the same thing that the Federal law does.",
  "You said that in your brief, didn't you?",
  "General, didn't you say in your brief -- I forget where it was -- I thought you said that the Justice Department doesn't get nearly enough money to enforce our immigration laws? Didn't you say that?",
  "Exactly. Okay. So the state says, well, that may be your priorities, but most of these people that you're not going after -- or an inordinate percentage of them, are here in our state, and we don't like it. They are causing all sorts of problems. So we're going to help you enforce Federal law. We're not going to do anything else. We're just enforcing Federal law.",
  "Can't you avoid that particular foreign relations problem by simply deporting these people? Free them from the jails - -",
  "And send them back to the countries that are -- that are objecting.",
  "What's the problem with that?",
  "So we -- we have to -- we have to enforce our laws in a manner that will please Mexico? Is that what you're saying?",
  "It sounded like what you were saying.",
  "-- think field preemption; is that your argument with respect to this section?",
  "Is there some -- is there some super body that decides what constitutes a violation of the particular norms of international law? That is to say, these other countries that have jurisdiction, they decide for themselves, don't they, what -- whether there's been a violation of the international norm or not?",
  "Sure, national courts have been the deciders when -- when the violation occurs within the nation. But to give national courts elsewhere the power to determine whether a United States corporation in the United States has violated a norm of international law is something else, it seems to me.",
  "Yes, but -- but general - - general common law was not considered to be Federal law, neither Federal law nor state law. If that were so, every tort action, which in those days were decided under -- under a general law that was up there in the sky, would have been a Federal -- a Federal claim.",
  "Common law. It's general common law.",
  "Well, that isn't the issue. The issue is whether when they do so they are enforcing Federal law or not.",
  "Ms. Sullivan, can I ask you about your position on extraterritorial application. I believe strongly in the presumption against extraterritorial application, but do you know of any other area where extraterritorial application only means application on the territory of a foreign country and not application on the high seas?",
  "I find that -- you know, extraterritorial means extraterritorial, but -- but you contend that this -- as I think you must -- that this statute applies on the high seas.",
  "Oh, you don't? Okay. I thought that was common ground. I'm glad to know it isn't.",
  "I understand that. That's the worst. But I really don't -- you appeal to the general principle of territoriality of our laws. And, as I say, I don't know any other case where -- where that principle allows our securities laws to be applied on the high seas, for example - -",
  "-- even though they can apply in Australia.",
  "Excuse me. Excuse me. Do you mean that the courts -- in those areas where you acknowledge the statute applies, that the courts will not apply doctrines of exhaustion, of, you know, comity, of -- the appropriateness of bringing the action here? Of course they will, won't they?",
  "General Verrilli, the - - that's -- that is a new position for the -- for the State Department, isn't it?",
  "And for -- and for the United States Government? Why should -- why should we listen to you rather than the solicitors general who took the opposite position and the position taken by Respondents here in other cases, not only in several courts of appeals, but even up here?",
  "I understand that, but - -",
  "It -- it was - -",
  "-- it was the responsibility of your predecessors as well, and they took a different position. So, you know, why -- why should we defer to the views of -- of the current administration?",
  "Oh, okay.",
  "But we don't -- we are not very good at figuring out the foreign policy interests of the United States. And, you know, in the past we have tried to get out from under our prior case law in the sovereign immunity area of asking the State Department. And the State Department would come in here: This is good; this is bad. We abandoned all that in the sovereign immunity field. Why should we walk back into it here? Or do you intend to have us make these foreign policy decisions?",
  "No, but assuming Congress doesn't act. Why should -- you know, you want us to listen to the State Department case by case. Is that - -",
  "But we listen to the State Department as to what those categories ought to be.",
  "It may have been wrong.",
  "I would rather listen to the Dutch Government than one, one Dutch judge, frankly.",
  "You should have phrased the test that way then, because it really - -",
  "That doesn't seem to me a very felicitous description of what -- of what the test is -- is enunciated to be.",
  "The test is whether it's, what, practically able?",
  "Practically capable. Well, you could be practically capable of doing something, even though the purpose of -- of setting the thing up has nothing to do with that.",
  "I understand. I'm just saying we ought to get a different test, and let's - - let's get rid of this. If we agree with you, let's get rid of this practically capable test, because practically capable, frankly, would make us come out the other way in this case.",
  "Can I ask about that definition? That definition comes from the Rules of Construction Act, right - -",
  "-- which provides the meaning of all -- of the word vessel as used in the United States Code. Okay?",
  "What -- what meaning of vessel in the United States Code is at issue here?",
  "Could you finish your prior answer? You -- you started to say --",
  "-- you started to say that the Civil Service Reform Act made some fundamental change?",
  "Yes.",
  "Suppose -- suppose the Civil Service Reform Act had said nothing at all about -- about suits under the Civil Rights Act, under the Age Discrimination and Employment Act and so forth. What would the situation be? Wouldn't you have a right to go to district court?",
  "So, to prevent you from going to district court under those statutes, you have to find a repealer contained somewhere -­",
  "-- in the Civil Service Reform Act, correct?",
  "Why isn't that a repealer of what would otherwise be the law under all these civil rights statutes? Why isn't that a repealer of what would otherwise be their right to go to district court? You are saying, no, you can't go to district court because of these time limits, not even established by statute, but, for Pete's sake, established by regulation. You think that that's -- that's an effective repealer of the right to go to district court?",
  "He was just keeping score.",
  "Checking them off.",
  "I assume you’re appealing to the textual principle that the specific governs the general. Isn't that what's going on here?",
  "That the Tucker Act is a more general provision, and you are saying it's -- it's overcome by a more specific provision that provides for compensation, but excludes the Federal Government.",
  "Excuse me. 1681b(b)(b), you said? Where is that case?",
  "You said 7a.",
  "Right.",
  "Still in all, your argument is -- is not just a straightforward specific governs the general argument. I mean, that would be the case if -- if the other statute which the plaintiff is trying to run around through the Tucker Act specifically -- it clearly prohibits suit against the Government. Then you would say, you know, the specific governs the general even though the govern -- the Tucker Act permits it; this statute prohibits it. But you're saying this other statute here does not really prohibit it. You're just saying this other statute does not permit it under our usual rules about waiver of sovereign immunity being strictly construed. So, you know, it's a -- it's a -- it's a difference -- it's an odd sort of a specific governs the general argument.",
  "No, but that's -- that's because the negative implication of that statute is -- affirms that there is no liability of the United States. Okay? But here, you don't have -- you don't have that negative implication at all, do you?",
  "Isn't it really -- doesn't the question come down to as you're putting it whether -- whether the Tucker Act eliminates for all other statutes the presumption against liability on the part of the United States?",
  "In which case you would lose, not win.",
  "Yes – you better resist it.",
  "So what is covered by the Tucker Act? I mean, every -- every basis for suit against the Government, every claim that the Government owes you money rests upon some statutory text, doesn't it?",
  "So what --",
  "Okay. Express contracts with the United States. Anything else?",
  "Okay. But anything that comes under a statute, you would look to the other statute to see whether there is sovereign immunity under that statute; and, if there is under that statute, then the Tucker Act does not overcome it.",
  "Say it again. I lost it. Give me the last sentence again.",
  "Well, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't need the Tucker Act now, would you?",
  "Just sue under the statute.",
  "So are you splitting your claim? I mean, if you have both a cause of action under FCRA and under the Tucker Act, the one has to go to the Federal Circuit and the other elsewhere, or the Court of Claims and then the Federal Circuit? What do you do?",
  "You also claimed under FCRA, under the statute, right?",
  "Okay.",
  "Do you know any other statutes offhand -- I can't think of any, but maybe you know some -- in which you can get money out of the United States but don't have to go through the Court of Claims and the Federal circuit? What other statutes are there? And if there are none, the reason I ask the question, it becomes less and less plausible that FCRA was meant to allow suit against the Federal Government.",
  "For money damages.",
  "For the same reason that you have the principle of sovereign immunity. They're -- they are perfectly willing to subject corporations to immense liability, but they are not willing to subject the Federal Government to immense liability. That's what the doctrine of sovereign immunity is all about, isn't it?",
  "I -- I really have -- I haven't followed this argument. You say (l) --",
  "-- shows that they had liability by the Government in mind?",
  "I mean, why anybody -- notwithstanding any other provision, the remedies and sanctions set forth in this section shall be the only judicial remedies and sanctions for violation of this section.",
  "Why -- why does that bear upon whether the United States is liable or not?",
  "I see.",
  "Well, if you are right about that, I guess we could write a very narrow opinion saying the Tucker Act applies where there is a cause of action under the original statute anyway, in which case we would not have made much new law, would we?",
  "Yes.",
  "The Government doesn't concede that you have a cause of action under FCRA at all.",
  "They say -- they say just the opposite. And so what I find peculiar is that there should be two causes of action for the same thing. You can proceed either under FCRA or under the Tucker Act or both. I mean, that's very strange to me. It seems to me, one or the other, and it would normally be the specific governing the general. So if you say there is one under FCRA, why do we need the Tucker Act?",
  "Do you have any other case where -- where you -- somebody's been allowed to proceed under the Tucker Act where there is clear ability to proceed under some other statute?",
  "Mr. Srinivasan, I hate to eat up any of your time, but do you acknowledge that there are other statutes under which a person can proceed, either under the statute or under the Tucker Act?",
  "What about the Privacy Act?",
  "So -- so you'd say you either proceed under the Privacy Act and you're covered there, or you don't --",
  "And what about -- what is it? FSLA was the other one?",
  "What about (u)(l), that your friend raised?",
  "Well, I assume that in -- in many cases, especially capital cases, one could argue for years over whether -- whether, in fact, there was enough indication that the court did not consider it or not, right? And every year is a reduction of sentence, so to speak.",
  "There would be a lot of good debate over whether it was presented clearly enough, is presenting it in two sentences enough to require the court to answer it. I can see a whole -- you know, a whole train of litigation on this wonderful subject, a whole new area of law. Has the -- has the State supreme court overlooked something that was clearly enough presented, and is there enough indication that the State court has overlooked it? I mean -- that's the problem.",
  "Doesn't the -- doesn't the word denied at the end of the order say the same thing? We've considered --",
  "-- all of the points made, and we have denied them. And wouldn't it be the case that if you require such a statement, but you have a situation where a Federal question occupies 90 percent of the brief, and the court only addresses explicitly the state things, the state claims, and then at the very end says, we have considered all the other claims, presumably including the 90 percent Federal claims that are not addressed, would we be out of the woods, or would you be here again arguing the same problem?",
  "Was Sanguinetti -- had we had any temporary takings cases before Sanguinetti?",
  "In other words, was Sanguinetti expressing a special rule for flooding, or was it -- was it simply saying there can't be a temporary taking? If the latter, that dictum if it's dictum or a holding if it was a holding has already been overruled by our later temporary takings cases.",
  "We have cases about flying overland -- -",
  "-- cases about shooting - - shooting overland. Right?",
  "That's not water, but it ain't taking, either, in the -- in the narrow sense that Justice Breyer has talked about.",
  "What if it hadn't harmed the timber? I mean, you know, the damages claimed are a lot -- a lot of the timber that -- that would have been valuable was -- was impaired by these floodings. Suppose there'd been no harm at all? Suppose it had just been for a certain period of time you were not able to use that land for anything? You couldn't plant anything on it. You couldn't picnic on it. You couldn't do anything. Would that have been - - nonetheless, despite the fact that there -- there was no harm done except -- except the flooding -- would that have been a taking?",
  "Well, he has. It's flooded. He can't - -",
  "It does. He can't plow on it. He can't picnic on it. How does that not interfere with his - -",
  "So it would be a taking. Are you saying yes or no? What is it?",
  "So our cases -- our cases treat physical occupations differently from other - - from other cases, don't they? The park ranger walking through can hardly be called a physical occupation. He's harmed the land, but it's not a physical occupation. What you're -- what you're arguing here is that -- is that flooding the land is a physical occupation for the period that it's flooded.",
  "Yes, but what you say - - here's what troubles me. You say it has to be substantial. But you -- can we -- can we fold into that word substantial a requirement that it have caused substantial financial loss? See, if that were the case, then -- then I could distinguish your case where a lot of valuable trees got destroyed.",
  "And I wouldn't say every - - you know, every flood that goes across a land, even two years or three years in a row, would not necessarily be a taking.",
  "What was the Kansas City case that you are referring to? I don't - -",
  "I don't -- I don't understand what you're saying. Are you saying that if this landowner owned land behind the dam that was temporarily flooded as often as has happened here, that that would be a taking?",
  "No, I didn't think you were saying that.",
  "A foreseeable and certain incidental consequence.",
  "Well, no, not necessarily. Suppose there -- because of a spring melt-off or other factors, it's clear that the reservoir for several months of the year will be more extensive than it will the rest of the year.",
  "So you could say, just - - just as here, that there's only been a temporary taking of some of the land behind the reservoir. Now, doesn't the -- doesn't the Government condemn all the land - -",
  "-- even that which would be only temporarily flooded?",
  "Of course, that can't overrule the Takings Clause, can it?",
  "I mean, that's nice that Congress doesn't want to be liable.",
  "I mean, the issue is who is going to pay for that wonderful benefit to these farmers. Should it be everybody, so that the Government pays, and all of us pay through taxes, or should it be this -- this particular sorry landowner who happens to lose all his trees?",
  "That doesn't seem to me particularly fair.",
  "I don't think -- one of those risks has to be the Government's going to make you pay for protecting somebody else. Is that one of the risks?",
  "I doubt that.",
  "Not flooding that time of year. That's the problem. I mean -- yes, flooding at a time when it wouldn't harm the trees.",
  "You -- you would say that even -- even if this land was permanently flooded, okay, permanently flooded so he couldn't use it at all, since it was downstream, no harm done, right?",
  "But that's your position.",
  "Yes, but he loses because the Corps comes in and says, yes, indeed, we did flood 2, but, in order to save, you know, 1 and 3 through 10. Right? And -- and he'd lose.",
  "Okay. It's not arbitrary.",
  "You -- you don't think that AEDPA would alter the outcome of Rees? Do you think Rees would come out the other way after AEDPA?",
  "That's a different point.",
  "In all cases?",
  "Well, I don't really understand why the American Psychiatric Association said 6 to 9 months, too. I mean, 90 percent are cured within 9 months, right?",
  "So you don't have to follow them in that non sequitur, it seems to me.",
  "Because they are not lawyers, right? They are psychiatrists.",
  "Well, what's a reasonable extension?",
  "Another 4 months? 6 months?",
  "I was with you. It seemed to me you had something really, really clear and solid, until you said, \"reasonable extension.\"",
  "Is that any different from what the defendants are arguing here?",
  "They're saying, you know, give a -- give a temporary stay and extend it as long as -- as you need to.",
  "So you're taking their position.",
  "\"Could provide\" means might provide; is that it? Might?",
  "So just a possibility - -",
  "-- that's all it takes?",
  "Excuse me. If the client is incompetent, you -- you bring both claims, right? You -- you both -- you both challenge the guilt, and you challenge the sentence.",
  "So why -- why -- why is it -- it is unfair to prevent -- to stop everything, so that the client can tell you not to bring one of those things? I don't know why that's unfair.",
  "But you can't get that in, right? I mean, aren't you limited to the record? So what -- what use is it - -",
  "-- to -- to find out these little -- little secret things that your client knows, if they cannot be admitted?",
  "Alternatively, we could - - we could rule that indefinite stays are never appropriate; in which case, it would be unnecessary to decide whether any stay is appropriate where -- for a record-based claim, right?",
  "We can do it from either end.",
  "Or we could decide both, I suppose.",
  "Rees -- Rees was not an indefinite stay in -- in the absolute sense, was it?",
  "Because the trial proceeded. There -- there was going to be an end, right?",
  "Well, it's really -- it's really not the same question when it comes back, is it? Because there are two questions: Is -- is reasonable competence useful for his defense? But, also, the second question, is there a reasonable probability that he can be restored to competence? The first time, there obviously is that, and you give him a year. When you come back a second time, you say, well, it's been a year, they usually come back within 6 to 9 months, there is no longer a reasonable probability.",
  "Mr. Michelman, we -- we have established a different standard for the degree of competence that has to exist in order to prevent execution, right? The -- the prisoner has to be aware of what is being done and why it's being done.",
  "And that's a much lower standard than the standard of competence required for deciding whether he can assist counsel, right?",
  "Well, it's -- no, it's a much -- it's a much easier standard for the state to establish.",
  "Well, wait. All he has to know to prevent -- to prevent execution is he has to know that he's being executed for a crime, right? And - -",
  "-- in order to assist counsel, doesn't he have to know a lot more than that?",
  "Well, just make believe that I'm right about that, okay?",
  "That there are two standards, and one is really quite more difficult than the other. Why isn't the difference between the standards utterly eliminated? Because whenever there is a capital case, a habeas petition is filed, and counsel says, my -- my client cannot -- cannot -- cannot assist me. Oh, yes, he understands why he's being executed, but he may have a new claim, he may be able to tell me stuff, so we have to stay the execution indefinitely until he can assist -- assist me in -- in continuing his defense. You've just converted the standard for proceeding with the execution from an easier one to a much more difficult one.",
  "Mental health experts always agree, don't they? Those provided by the defense always agree with those provided by the prosecution. Yes.",
  "We've had cases involving alleged discrimination in state -- state contracting. And we haven't required the person who was discriminated against because of race to prove that he would have gotten the contract otherwise, have we?",
  "It's -- it's been enough that there was a denial of equal protection.",
  "Her claim is not necessarily that she would have been -- would have been admitted, but that she was denied a fair chance in the admission lottery. Just as when a person is denied participation in the contracting lottery, he has suffered an injury.",
  "Was it -- was it done before or after they announced the decision to reinstitute racial - -",
  "Which came almost immediately after our decision in Grutter.",
  "And by the way, do you think that Grutter -- this goes to Justice Breyer's question -- do you think that Grutter held that there is no more affirmative action in higher education after 2028?",
  "Was that the holding of Grutter?",
  "That's a scary -- that's a scary - -",
  "There are facts, and there are facts, aren't there?",
  "That -- that's a normal fact that we accede to two-court holdings on, whether there is -- is or is not a critical mass?",
  "It's a weird kind of a fact.",
  "It's an estimation, isn't it? A judgment?",
  "Why -- why don't you seriously suggest that? Why don't you seriously suggest that demographic -- that the demographic makeup of the state has nothing to do with whether somebody feels isolated, that if you're in a state that is only 1 percent black that doesn't mean that you're not isolated, so long as there's 1 percent in the class?",
  "I wish you would take that position because it seems, to me, right.",
  "Excuse me. The 10 percent plan is not imposed by the University. It's not their option - -",
  "-- to say this -- this is not good for education because people will take easy courses. It's imposed by state law, isn't it?",
  "Anybody who is in the top 10 percent of any school in the state gets into the University of Texas.",
  "Do they have to self-identify?",
  "And how do they decide? You know, it's -- they want not just a critical mass in the school at large, but class by class? How do they figure out that particular classes don't have enough? What -- are they -- somebody walks in the room and looks them over to see who looks -- who looks Asian, who looks black, who looks Hispanic? Is that -- is that how it's done?",
  "I don't know what you are talking about. I mean, it is either a factor that is validly in this case or it isn't. Now, do they look to individual classroom diversity or not? And if so, how do they decide when classes are diverse?",
  "Fine. I'm asking how. How did they look to the classroom?",
  "On their way in -- did they require everybody to check a box or they have somebody figure out, oh, this person looks 1/32nd Hispanic, and that's enough?",
  "What kind of a study? What kind of a study?",
  "Yes. It doesn't explain to me how they go about, classroom by classroom, deciding how many minorities there are.",
  "I don't understand that. Why? Why -- why doesn't it?",
  "What kind of viewpoints? I mean, are they political viewpoints?",
  "This -- this has nothing to do with, with racial diversity. I mean, you're talking about something else.",
  "Also, the kind that is likely to be included within the 10 percent rule. And, incidentally, when -- when was the 10 percent rule adopted?",
  "But that -- that -- that holds for only -- only another what, 16 years, right? Sixteen more years, and you're going to call it all off.",
  "But you're appealing to Grutter, and that's what it said.",
  "Some of the stuff that Grutter says -- some of the stuff that Grutter says you agree with, some of the stuff that it says you don't agree with.",
  "Well, that's part of the injury she suffered. It's -- it's not the only injury perhaps.",
  "But she -- she had to pay an admissions fee for a process in which she was not treated fairly.",
  "Why shouldn't she get her money back?",
  "Since we are asking questions about just curiosity, I am curious to know how many -- this is a very ambitious racial program here at the University of Texas. How many people are there in the affirmative action department of the University of Texas? Do you have any idea? I mean, there must be a lot of people to, you know, to monitor all these classes and do all of this assessment of race throughout the thing. There would be a large number of people be out of a job, wouldn't we, wouldn't they, if we suddenly went to just 10 percent?",
  "How many people?",
  "You don't.",
  "Yes, but -- but the hypothetical is that the two applicants are entirely the same in all other respects.",
  "And if -- if the ability to give a racial preference means anything at all, it certainly has to mean that, in the -- in the hypothetical given -- given by Justice Alito, the minority student gets in and the other one doesn't.",
  "It's not a matter of not everyone; it's a matter of two who are identical in all other respects.",
  "And what does the racial preference mean if it doesn't mean that in that situation the minority applicant wins and the other one loses?",
  "But, they're already talking - -",
  "We should probably stop calling it critical mass then, because mass, you know, assumes numbers, either in size or a certain weight.",
  "So we should stop calling it mass.",
  "Call it a cloud or something like that.",
  "Excuse me. I don't understand.",
  "Material weight says less than 1 ounce - -",
  "-- parentheses, \"Approximate weight is 1\" -- 1 -- oh, I see, 1.3 grams.",
  "What -- what is the conviction?",
  "What does the conviction mean? You say the categorical approach.",
  "Is -- is it the categorical statute under which you have been convicted or, as you seem to be saying, the indictment?",
  "Is he convicted of that? Or is he convicted of violating Georgia Code 16-13, whatever it is?",
  "Counsel, I thought that when Congress enacted this provision, there was not the distinction between elements and sentencing factors that we now have, that the statute was enacted, in other words, before Apprendi.",
  "That may be, but it certainly goes to your argument that Congress had in mind some distinction between elements and sentencing factors.",
  "Mr. Verrilli, we've had - - we've had cases in the past where it is clear that nobody would have standing to challenge what is -- what is brought before this Court.",
  "And we've said that that just proves that under our system of separated powers, it is none of our business.",
  "Do -- do we parse injury that finely? I mean, the injury, it seems to me, is being overheard. Does it -- by the government. Do we say, oh, well, it's one injury to be overheard under this statute, it's another injury to be overheard under another statute? Do you know any case where we've - - we've cut the baloney that fine?",
  "Well, the thing is they are going to be injured by being overheard. And you're saying that they will be overheard anyway, and, therefore, by preventing the government from overhearing them under this statute, we're not redressing their grievance, which is being overheard by the government.",
  "Does that assessment take into account the fact that a court is going to pass upon the government's ability to intercept these communications?",
  "With the obligation to apply the Fourth Amendment.",
  "But if as you say those procedures violate the Fourth Amendment, it doesn't matter what the statute says.",
  "If those statutory provisions would produce a violation of the Fourth Amendment, they are null and void, right?",
  "Okay. So the FISA Court would presumably know that.",
  "Excuse me, before we go further. A reasonable reaction to the risk; but it doesn't have to be a reasonable reaction to a certainly impending risk, does it?",
  "But that's his question. Doesn't it undermine the certainly impending?",
  "Mr. Jaffer, apart -- apart from the government's power that you point out to conduct some of this surveillance without approval by the FISA court in an emergency situation for 1 year, leaving that aside, I don't see how the rest of your challenge or your challenge to the remainder of this statute can be characterized as a facial challenge, because it necessarily assumes that the FISA court will mistakenly say that there has been no Fourth Amendment violation, doesn't it?",
  "Well, it -- it can say it's unreasonable because you have unreasonably limited us. Don't you think the FISA court is able to say, what we're allowed to look into under this statute does not comport with the Fourth Amendment.",
  "We have to look into more.",
  "Are there restrictions on giving the information to other government agencies, in particular, the Justice Department?",
  "Do you mean by \"lawfully made under this title,\" simply lawfully made in a manner that does not violate United States copyright law?",
  "The standards, okay. So - - so it could be lawfully made in England, let's say; in a country that has compulsory licensing, it could be lawfully made there, but it would not be lawfully made under our -- under our copyright law, because we don't have that.",
  "So -- so at least they are correct in contending that what you are arguing for is -- is not lawfully made under -- lawfully made if the United States copyright law had applied where it was made; is that what you are saying?",
  "No?",
  "I don't -- I don't follow that.",
  "Right.",
  "Okay.",
  "Of -- of those -- of those courts that did hold the way your -- your opponent would -- would have it, am I correct that only one of them adopted the absolutist rule?",
  "Well, that's right. And there's such a thing as what is called the curtilage of a house. As I understand the law, the police are entitled to use binoculars to look into the house if - - if the residents leave the blinds open, right?",
  "But if they can't see clearly enough from a distance, they're not entitled to go onto the curtilage of the house, inside the gate, and use the binoculars from that vantage point, are they?",
  "Why isn't it the same thing with the dog? This dog was brought right up -- right up to the -- to the door of the house.",
  "Well, then we've taken an unrealistic case, if that has been conceded, because it seems to me crucial that this officer went onto the portion of the house that -- as to which there is privacy, and -- and used a means of -- of discerning what was in the house that -- that should not have been available - -",
  "-- in that space.",
  "Police officers can come there to knock on the door, but I thought you've conceded that police officers can't come there to look into the house with binoculars, right?",
  "When the purpose of the officer's going there is to -- is to conduct a search, it's not permitted.",
  "It isn't just the sniffing in the abstract. It's the sniffing at this point, the sniffing at a person's front door, right? I mean - -",
  "Well, I didn't say it wouldn't be a search if the police officer himself did that if he went there with the intention of -- of smelling at the door. He's going there to search, and he shouldn't be on the curtilage to search.",
  "Suppose you -- you have someone who, who has been guilty of a crime. He has - - he has the body. He has committed a murder and he has the body in the home. He certainly wants to keep that private, right? And he foolishly and mistakenly leaves the blinds open in the room where -- where the corpse is lying, and the policeman at a great distance has a telescope and he looks through the blinds and he sees the corpse. Can the police go into the home?",
  "Oh -- he hasn't knowingly. He was careless.",
  "He certainly wanted to keep it -- he wanted to keep it private.",
  "Well, you could say the same thing here. They wanted to keep private the fact that they were growing the marijuana, but they -- they used a means of suppressing the heat that made it impossible to keep it private.",
  "They were careless.",
  "There were the mothballs.",
  "But, Mr. Blumberg, I think you're, with respect, misguided to concede that if it was just the officer alone without the dog, it would be perfectly okay.",
  "Well, I thought you did.",
  "And I would assume you would say that if the officer walks up there with no intention to knock and talk, but just walks up to the door with the intention of sniffing at the door, you would consider that to be a violation, wouldn't you?",
  "All right. Again, I think you're wrong not to accept that. I think our cases support it. I think you cannot enter the protected portion of a home, which is called the curtilage, with the intention of conducting a search, that that is not permitted. I think our cases establish that.",
  "And it's fine to say -- I don't think it's true that the intent of the officer is never relevant. It is relevant in that context. The reason for the officer going onto protected property, if he's going on just to knock on the door to sell tickets to the Policeman's Ball, that's fine. If he's going on to conduct a search, that's something else.",
  "But you do say that this is an easier case.",
  "It's not the sidewalk here, is it? It's the front part.",
  "There's -- there's an implied license to -- to go on to the curtilage for most people.",
  "The curtilage is -- is not sacrosanct.",
  "Yes.",
  "Are you for or against the dog this time?",
  "For it.",
  "I suppose that if the reasonableness of a search depended upon some evidence given by a medical doctor, the Court would not go back and examine how well that doctor was trained at Harvard Medical School and, you know, what classes he took and so forth, right.",
  "You don't want coon dogs chasing squirrels.",
  "But what - -",
  "Now I thought the court said -- held against the state. I thought what the Florida court was saying is that if you didn't produce it, the dog's evidence would -- would not be allowed -- it's - -",
  "-- the search is invalid.",
  "Yes.",
  "Even worse.",
  "Is that a requirement too? That's a constitutional requirement, that the dog training doesn't count unless it's training with the officer who is using the dog?",
  "Well, fine. Counsel can bring that up. Counsel can bring that up at the hearing before the judge. But -- but I understood this to be a -- a requirement. You never even get to that hearing, because there's no evidence that this dog was ever trained with this policeman.",
  "Yes, and therefore end of case, right?",
  "Well - -",
  "What -- what -- what are the -- what are the incentives here? Why would a police department want to use an incompetent dog? Is that any more likely than that a medical school would want to certify an incompetent doctor? What -- what incentive is there for a police department?",
  "And that's a good thing?",
  "I mean, you acquire probable cause, you go in and there's nothing there. You've wasted the time of your police officers, you've wasted a lot of time.",
  "Well, maybe the police department doesn't care about that, but it certainly cares about wasting the time of its police officers in fruitless searches.",
  "Willy-nilly. Officers just like to search. They don't particularly want to search where they're likely to find something. They just like to search. So let's get dogs that, you know, smell drugs when there are no drugs. You really think that that's what's going on here?",
  "They like to search where they're likely to find something, and that only exists when the dog is well trained. It seems to me they have every incentive to train the dog well.",
  "Oh, I assure you that if we agree with you there will be a whole body of experts that will spring into being about dog training. I assure you that that will be the case.",
  "Yes, but -- but counsel, you're defending a Florida Supreme Court opinion which says \"must.\" You can't just say, you know, I'm not asserting any particular thing is necessary, just, you know, totality of the circumstances. You have an opinion here in which the Florida Supreme Court says \"must.\" It must include the, you know, the field training. Now, do -- do you disavow that or -- or do you want us the ignore it? What?",
  "If -- if this is absent in the totality of the circumstances and you nonetheless hold that there was probable cause, then \"must\" does not mean \"must,\" right?",
  "But they are likely to be found if there is a residual odor of drugs, even though the drugs are no longer there. So it's not an incompetent dog when he alerts because of the residual odor.",
  "But at least we don't have to worry about mothballs in this case; is that right? There are no mothballs?",
  "Would you -- would you allow counsel to ask about that?",
  "May be? There certainly is. I mean, that was Summers, wasn't it?",
  "Yes. He wasn't on the premises, he was on the sidewalk, right?",
  "He was in the curtilage of the house.",
  "Excuse me. Just the stop would be -- but -- but they did more than just stop them. They - -",
  "-- they handcuffed them.",
  "Mr. Shanmugam, please help me. I -- I don't understand why -- why the Terry stop is at issue, inasmuch as there was not a Terry stop. I mean, what occurred here went well beyond a Terry stop, did it not? So what do you do? You -- you slice the baloney that thin; you say well, the -- the first stop is a Terry stop. Oh, yes, he later went on to detain them for a long time and put handcuffs on them and take them back to the premises. What -- what relevance does the Terry stop have?",
  "Well, I guess -- I guess, I just didn't realize that it's an open question whether you can do that much in -- in a mere Terry stop.",
  "Well, physical bounds of the property is -- is too much. I mean, you know, what if it's a farm and it's a 50-acre farm?",
  "I think you are much better off, I think your submissions sometimes say immediate vicinity.",
  "I like that much better than boundaries of the property.",
  "You're not saying that they can't stop them from leaving. Have you said that; they can't stop them from leaving?",
  "The threat is from anybody coming back to the house, not just the person who just left.",
  "And surely the police, when they're conducting a search, post guards to prevent people from coming in.",
  "I assume they always do. It seems to me there's no special threat from the person who -- who left the house. There's always a threat of somebody else coming into the house.",
  "If -- if you have a large enough force that you can afford to send two of them in a car chasing this fellow for a mile, why can't you just post those two outside the house, just in case somebody, whether it's this person who's just left or anybody else, comes back? I mean, it -- it seems to me that - - that what your positing is -- is -- is unlikely, namely, having -- having sufficient personnel to follow these persons, but not having sufficient personnel to defend the premises against somebody entering.",
  "There is something magical about the gate or at least about the immediate facility of the house. What we're trying to apply here is an absolute rule to make it unnecessary for the officers to guess whether they can do this or that. And the rule you propose is, well, you know, a mile away. What's your test, a reasonable - -",
  "As soon as reasonably practicable. You consider that an absolute test? I thought that the test we invented here was meant to help officers, to say this is the rule and you can do it. And you want to do anything else, use Terry or use - - use normal probable cause principles, but this is an absolute rule governing the -- the search of a home.",
  "It doesn't give you a where. You need more than a who. You need a who and a where.",
  "So what? What's he going to -- he's going to phone them and say, hey, you know, you're going to be searched. The cops are crawling all around the house already. So the only realistic additional threat is that he is going to voluntarily go back to where the police are in the house? I mean, you know - -",
  "-- this is so implausible. What -- what harm - -",
  "-- what threat to the policemen can possibly exist?",
  "Very unusual.",
  "Very unusual.",
  "You don't adopt absolute rules to cover foolhardy people. I mean, we -- absolute rules are designed to cover the mine run of cases, the generality of cases, not the oddball case. That's not what you use an absolute rule for.",
  "The -- the procedure has to be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, right? Now - - now, the requirements for a warrant are not the outer bounds of -- of what's reasonable, but nonetheless, what -- it seems to me that what's reasonable under the Fourth Amendment can be estimated from what the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant to contain, and what a warrant must contain is a description of the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. And what you're arguing for is a special rule which says once you have a warrant that this place can be searched, you can seize anybody -- you can seize not only anybody there in order to protect the police, but anybody connected with the -- with the place. And that -- that is so contrary to what -- what seems to me the theory of -- of the Fourth Amendment that I am very reluctant to -- to extend our cases any further than they already exist.",
  "He might have wanted to help in the search.",
  "All law enforcement would be a lot easier if we didn't have the doggone Fourth Amendment. I mean, the Fourth Amendment is an impediment to law enforcement. Of course it is. There -- there's no doubt about that.",
  "Well, you can say there was a historical basis for the rule, in that officers have always been allowed to take necessary action to protect themselves. And that's the principal justification.",
  "Well, it's always the case. I mean, we -- we never come out with a decision that doesn't rely upon some preexisting principle. We always cite some preexisting principle. Does that mean that every case of ours is -- is not new law?",
  "Why pick on Strickland? I mean, you could say that about any principle of law that we rely on: The dissent thought that that principle applied a different way here. What is different about Strickland that it enables you to appeal to that, as opposed to appealing to any principle of law?",
  "The only new law is not a new pronouncement which nobody had ever thought of before, but only a pronouncement that rests upon an evolution of mores; is that it?",
  "That's what I thought you said.",
  "Mr. Fisher, I suppose you are right, I'm sure you're right that the mere fact that there was a dissent in the case that adopted the rule does not necessarily make it a new rule. But you, on the other hand, would agree, would you not, that those who dissented from that case would regard it as a new rule?",
  "Well, I think it's an easy question to answer.",
  "That's fair. That's fair. The dissenters ought to reconsider, you're saying.",
  "What's -- what's the sense of that? Why -- why -- let's assume, you know, at the time the guilty plea or whatever occurred, it was not the professional norm, and then later the professional norms change and he makes the argument that -- that he's entitled to relief, and you say yes, because --",
  "Is that what your opponent contends as well?",
  "Mr. Waxman, you have a habit of not pausing between sentences. You pause in the middle of the sentence, and you end a sentence and go right on to the next. So I apologize for interrupting, but --",
  "-- but you leave me no alternative.",
  "Yes, I understand.",
  "Is it not the case that one of the other elements necessary for the fraud-on-the-market theory would also be decided conclusively -- for future individual litigants, namely, the efficiency of the market? A future litigant will ordinarily claim, I either sold it at a depressed price or bought it at an inflated price because of the market's reaction to this particular fraudulent statement.",
  "So -- so you can say the same thing about the efficiency of the -- of the market being determined in this preliminary question, as you can say about -- about the -- the issue here.",
  "Mr. Frederick, you -- you say that -- you know, it's a flukey hypothetical where -- where the -- the issue here would -- would come up again in a different context in an individual suit. Let -- let me give you a -- a case that's -- that's not flukey and hypothetical. That is, it is usually the case that -- that people who are allegedly defrauded in stocks rely upon the fact that they bought it at an -- at an inflated price or sold it at a depressed price. Both of those questions depend upon the efficiency of the market. If the market is not efficient, a question that has to be decided for the class certification case, the individual investor is not going to be able to say, you know, that's -- that's why I got cheated, because the market reflected this false statement, and I paid more money for the stock than I should have. That -- that is not a flukey hypothetical. That is what will happen in most individual cases. And yet, that question of the efficiency of the market has to be decided at the class certification stage.",
  "You could say the same about materiality. If it's immaterial, it isn't reflected in -- in the market.",
  "So -- so the difference you assert is that, with respect to the issue here, it will be an issue in all individual cases; whereas with regard to the efficiency of the market, it will only be an issue in -- what, 95 percent of -- of the individual cases?",
  "The issue -- the issue is not whether -- whether it's a common question or not.",
  "The issue is whether there's any reason to believe that the -- that the market reflects reality.",
  "That's the issue.",
  "But there is -- there is a reason for deciding it earlier, and the reason is the -- the enormous pressure to settle once the class is certified. In most cases, that's the end of the lawsuit. There's -- there's automatically a settlement. Now, one way of -- of certifying the class is to show, well, you know, it's an efficient market, and you can presume that everybody in the class relied on the market. But that's only true if -- if the -- the statement was material to the market. If it was immaterial to the market, that isn't true. And you should not proceed any further, and you should not begin this -- this class action which, in -- in most cases, is simply the preliminary to a settlement. There is a good reason for deciding it sooner.",
  "What's the difference between 100 percent and 95 percent? I mean, most of the other claims in -- in stock cases are going to be based on what -- what the market price was when the person bought or sold. So -- you know, 95 percent instead of 100 percent, that's -- that's the basic difference?",
  "If you have the same question, then maybe we shouldn't have this fraud-on-the-market theory because the whole purpose of it is -- is to -- to assume that -- that the whole class was -- was damaged and relied -- because you can rely on an efficient market. But you can only rely on an efficient market where there has been a material misrepresentation. So maybe we should overrule Basic because it was certainly based upon a theory that -- that simply collapses once you remove the materiality element.",
  "Materiality is a common issue. Reliance is only a common issue if you accept the fraud-on-the-market theory. That's the problem. And you are using the one, which is a common issue, to leapfrog into the second, to make the -- the efficiency of the market reasoning something that it isn't.",
  "Or, to put it differently, an efficient market is a market that takes account of material factors, right?",
  "It's not an efficient market if it's -- you know -- it's -- who knows, random? It takes account of material factors.",
  "Excuse me.",
  "You -- you don't have to prove it to get the class certified. You only have to prove it to get the class certified with the benefit of the fraud-on-the-market theory.",
  "Which is a shortcut to getting the class certified, right?",
  "So this is just a condition to the shortcut.",
  "We must have thought that, I suppose, or else, we wouldn't have reformulated the question this way, right?",
  "That's the way you put the question initially, and we reformulated it to be a Daubert question.",
  "You're -- you are saying it's inadmissible if it's inadequately probative, right?",
  "So the two questions boil down to the same, don't they? If it's inadequately probative, it's inadmissible, isn't that right.",
  "Well, whenever.",
  "I'm talking about what -- what is the criterion for Daubert?",
  "Is it adequately probative? If not, it's inadmissible, so.",
  "Well, you want to say -­",
  "You say unreliable. I say inadequately probative. It's -- it is unreliable because it is inadequately probative.",
  "There --",
  "He didn't say what -- there -- there were four possibilities that he took into account, right, as to what the anticompetitive conduct was?",
  "And as it turns out, only one of those was found to -- to be in the game.",
  "That was the basis for the claims.",
  "It was not the basis? His was based only on the one that the court accepted? Where -- where in the record is -- is that?",
  "You can't be agnostic about what the anticompetitive conduct is, if you are going to do -- if you're going to do an analysis of what are the consequences of the -- of the anticompetitive conduct, you have to know the anticompetitive conduct you are talking about.",
  "Mr. --",
  "Mr. Barnett, suppose -­ suppose we held that where -- where there's a bench trial, it doesn't make any difference what -- what -- whether the judge excludes the evidence under Daubert -- I never know how to say it. Is it Daubert or Daubert?",
  "Yes, I think you're right. It doesn't make a dime's worth of difference whether the judge excludes it under -- under Daubert or proceeds to find it simply unreliable -- unreliable. Suppose -- suppose we held that. What -- what difference would it make in the world?",
  "So the trial judge could say, yes, I have a Daubert motion, but -- but I'm going to defer that. I'm just going to -- going to proceed to see whether this evidence is reliable.",
  "Because, I suppose, the judge is the government, too.",
  "So whether the unfairness adheres in the prosecution or in the judge, the guy's been treated unfairly.",
  "Counsel often encourage judges to do the wrong thing. In fact, in every case, there is one of the two counsel urging the court to do the wrong thing; right?",
  "That's what the adversary system consists of.",
  "So if -- if the judge did this on her own, that would have been okay? And there would be Double Jeopardy attaching?",
  "So we have to decide in each case whether the defendant was the initiating source of the error?",
  "What -- what if the defendant just agrees with the judge? The judge says - - you know, I think this indictment is bad because you - - you have to show that it wasn't a dwelling place, and the counsel for the Defendant says, yes, that seems like a good -- a good idea. Is -- is that enough to - -",
  "Well, my goodness, disagreement would be malpractice, wouldn't it?",
  "A bird in the hand, counsel. I -- I - -",
  "Well, we didn't have it, at the time of the founding, any mechanism for a judge to do that. I mean, this -- this is a new procedure, and how it fit into the prohibition of Double Jeopardy was certainly a -- an open question. It's not as though this procedure existed at the time of the founding or in English law before then and was never adequate to -- to constitute Double Jeopardy. It's a new procedure introduced, so the question for the Court was, well -- you know, if it's the judge rather than the jury that pronounces the acquittal, does -- does that constitute Double Jeopardy?",
  "Well, that's every misinterpretation. I mean, I don't know why this case doesn't involve simply a misinterpretation of what the elements of the crime are. I mean, any misinterpretation, you can -- which goes beyond the minimum that the -- that the statute requires, can be recharacterized as adding an additional element.",
  "So you're saying that your -- your approach doesn't solve the bench trial problem any more than your friend's approach, right?",
  "Finish the sentence. Notwithstanding that, what?",
  "Is that important, \"at defendant's behest\"?",
  "So you -- you're arguing that this should only -- only be -- this rule should only be applied when the defendant asks for it?",
  "Yes, but that -- is that an element of the crime?",
  "It has to be raised by the defendant, right?",
  "Which means it's not an element, so it doesn't have to be charged in the indictment. Now, how can something that goes to the existence or non-existence of an affirmative defense be an element?",
  "Well, you say that you - - you have to prove that the defendant was knowing and willfully a member of the conspiracy, right?",
  "That's what you said?",
  "Well, and you agree that that's the rule of law, right?",
  "Doesn't duress eliminate willfully?",
  "So why is that different from this? If that's not an element, for Pete's sake, even though the definition of the crime is knowingly and willfully, and yet, nonetheless, that's -- that's an affirmative defense, why -- why is that any different here?",
  "That doesn't prove that he withdrew.",
  "Which -- which of those are affirmative actions? I mean, the law is that he has to take an affirmative action withdrawing from the conspiracy. I don't think being in jail is -- is an affirmative action. I don't think being mad at the ringleader is an affirmative action. I don't think any of the things you've said amount to an affirmative withdrawal from the conspiracy.",
  "Maybe not, but it -- it may mean that we are wasting our time.",
  "They didn't have to prove within the limitations period. They didn't have to prove that. You acknowledged that that the -- look, what's at issue here is not a defense of withdrawal. It's the defense of the statute of limitations, right?",
  "You acknowledge that that is an affirmative defense. And you are arguing that what establishes that affirmative defense in this case, namely, withdrawal, is an element. How -- how can something that is -- that does nothing more than establish an affirmative defense be an element?",
  "I can't understand that. Can you give me any other example in the criminal law where -- where - -",
  "But that's not an affirmative -- I want an example of something which is an affirmative defense and where the proof of that affirmative defense becomes an element.",
  "Why doesn't it have to be contained in the indictment, if it's an element?",
  "Why is it up to the defendant to raise it, if it's an element?",
  "Okay. That at least is logical. I'm not sure it's right. But it's logical.",
  "But the government doesn't have to prove within the statutory period. It's up to the defendant to raise that defense, and if he doesn't raise it, it's waived.",
  "Did the government charge in the indictment that the conspiracy existed during this five-year period?",
  "During the particular five-year period.",
  "Did it have to do that?",
  "And if it did not have to, it would have been up to the defendant to say, the statute of limitations runs on my participation, right?",
  "But it -- it didn't say the conspiracy only existed within that five-year period?",
  "Well, let's assume it did. Would -- would -- let's say, in a burglary indictment - - let's say the burglary occurred seven years ago, and there is a five-year statute of limitations. If the indictment just -- just accuses the individual of conducting a burglary seven years ago, is that -- is that indictment invalid?",
  "So it's -- it's up to the defendant to say, no - -",
  "-- seven years is too long.",
  "So I guess the issue here is whether the government's statement that the conspiracy existed within this five-year period causes that to be an element of the crime?",
  "I wish I had -- we had the supervening indictment before us. It's -- it's not in the Joint Appendix.",
  "But it -- it's described in the Court of Appeals opinion as follows: \"According to the indictment in the district court and the evidence of the United States at trial, during the late 1980s and 1990s, appellants Rodney Moore, Kevin Gray, John Raynor, Calvin Smith, Timothy Handy, and Lionel Nunn, along with others, some of whom were also indicted, but tried separately, conspired to conduct and did conduct an ongoing drug distribution business in Washington.\" So apparently, according to that description, it -- it was not charged as a conspiracy during those five years. It was just charged as a conspiracy.",
  "That's right. So it would have been up to the defendant to prove that the statute of limitations barred -- barred his conviction.",
  "It's a jackalope, maybe. I never heard of a rabbit-duck.",
  "Insanity.",
  "Suppose this thing doesn't come up in the -- in the statute of limitations context. Suppose it comes up in the context of whether this defendant is liable for an act committed by the co-conspirators after he withdrew. So it's the same issue of whether -- whether he withdrew or not, before the murder of somebody, okay? He said -- you know, before that occurred, I was out of the conspiracy. What do our cases say about -- about proving it in that context? Is the burden on the defendant? Or is the burden on the prosecution?",
  "I suppose he could present his defense in the alternative, I didn't belong to the conspiracy, and anyway, I withdrew. I mean, he can make both of those points, can't he?",
  "Under -- under that provision, that's certainly true. You can't -- you can't get costs under that provision unless there has been that prerequisite. But it's -- you know, it's ancient law that repeals by implication are not favored. And what you're arguing here is that that provision effectively repeals another provision which allows costs in all cases, whether or not there has been misbehavior. Now, why -- why is this an exception to our general rule? I just don't -- this doesn't seem to me like a clear repealer.",
  "We -- we have to assume ignorance of the drafter.",
  "As a general principle.",
  "In -- in that respect, it is different from RadLAX, in which the two provisions -­ where we held the specific covers the general -- but we held that because the two provisions contradicted each other.",
  "Love and marriage.",
  "We have a lot of cases that say that -- that the agency's views about what courts should do are not entitled to deference. This is -- this is a matter --",
  "I guess, in the first sentence of 3, the phrase \"the costs of the action\" is really superfluous in light of 54(d)(1). You really don't know that. I mean, that would have been the case anyway. So there's no reason to think that it isn't frivolous in the second sentence -- or superfluous in the second sentence, right? Why did they have to say the costs of the action in the case of a successful action?",
  "The costs of the action, together with a reasonable -- as determined by the court.",
  "They -- they have the costs anyway, if Congress didn't write anything, right?",
  "I'm trying to help you.",
  "Gotcha.",
  "Well-taken.",
  "Isn't it -- isn't it the case that, in order to appeal to the proposition that the specific governs the general, you -- you have to read the second sentence of 3 as containing a negative -- a negative implication? As saying --",
  "It may not. So you are reading in a negative -­",
  "Suppose -- suppose the words \"and costs\" were left out in the second sentence? Would not the argument be made that you cannot award costs even in an action brought in bad faith? Wouldn't -- that this sum argument you're making --",
  "But you're saying \"negative implication.\" If it -- if it says only \"attorney's fees in reasonable relation to the work expended,\" the implication would be you --",
  "-- you cannot -- you cannot, even in the case of a frivolous action, award costs. Wouldn't that be the reading of it?",
  "Yes, but I'm suggesting if that argument is rejected, so should yours be.",
  "Because it seems the two are parallel.",
  "Yes, and I assume that was your point, that you shouldn't be put through the trouble of figuring out whether the new shoes that you produce are close enough to the old one to be covered or are not. You're at risk --",
  "-- right?",
  "What -- what -- what's the consideration -- I used to teach contract law. This is -- you know, you can just give a covenant like that?",
  "Do you have --",
  "Do you have any cases in which we -- we slice it that fine --",
  "-- that -- that you are a State actor for some anticompetitive purposes and not for others?",
  "I assume -- I assume that the normal corporate charter contains such a provision, the authority to acquire property, right?",
  "And we don't -- that -- that charter is issued by the State, right?",
  "And we don't -- we don't think that that enables all corporations to ignore the Sherman Act, do we?",
  "Well, I -- I don't see how any of that pertains to whether they can create a hospital monopoly. You can do all of that, even though you are not the only hospital in the area.",
  "Well, but the only respect relevant here is -- is -- the only respect relevant is the ability to acquire other hospitals.",
  "Right? And that's -- and that's a general corporate power. Every corporation in Georgia has the power to acquire, including acquire other businesses.",
  "Well, a lot of States have that. You can't open a new hospital without getting a certificate of need. Are you saying that, in all of those, States the -- the result is that the antitrust laws can be ignored?",
  "Mr. Waxman, if you don't want to be interrupted, you have to pause between sentences.",
  "I understand. That's right. You've given a -- you know, an appealing example of a small county that has one -- one hospital, and this operation purchases that one -- one hospital. Seems nothing wrong with that; although, as Justice Sotomayor suggests, I doubt whether the FTC would be pursuing a situation in which there is a natural monopoly. It's a question of whether the monopoly would be owned by the State or not. But your argument, if we follow it, embraces a quite different situation, a very large county which has five hospitals that are competing vigorously in price, in specialties, they advertise on the radio, as some hospitals do. And what you're saying is that this operation can take over all of those hospitals and eliminate all of that competition. Isn't that so?",
  "Yes.",
  "We have no -- we have no idea whether they are willing to do that.",
  "And we have a Federal antitrust law.",
  "Why -- why didn't it intend this? I don't understand. You -- you've told us that they did intend this, that they did intend to displace competition.",
  "And now, you say, but Georgia will say, oh, no, they didn't intend to displace competition.",
  "Which is it?",
  "Hard rock instead of --",
  "Excuse me. Why -- why -- why no more? Why just Skidmore?",
  "That's an absolute rule?",
  "We didn't take this case to -- to decide those factual questions.",
  "We really didn't. We took it principally to decide whether the Seventh Circuit rule was -- was right or not. And you don't even defend that. So there is nobody here defending the Seventh Circuit.",
  "They are not talking to us here, are they?",
  "What does that have to do with agency? That's what I don't understand. Why -- why do any of these tests have to do with agency?",
  "I mean, I can understand Congress writing a statute that says -- you know, any -- any person given -- given authority by the employer, which authority is used to make it more difficult for a person to complain about racial or sexual harassment, is bad. But the statute doesn't say that. It says apply agency principles. How does agency have anything to do with the line you're arguing that we take here?",
  "Then why not leave it there? If that's what the agency is --",
  "-- then you don't need it at all. So the music -- the music would -- the thermostat would qualify. It would all qualify.",
  "Why? Why? I mean, if that's your principle, apply the principle.",
  "If you are aided -- you know, you're going to work in a cold room unless you -- you know, comply with my sexual advances, apply the principle. What's so hard about that? That's a clear line.",
  "I didn't think we took this case to review the plan. Is -- is that what the Supreme Court took the case for, to say what this particular individual plan said?",
  "Had that -- had that point been raised, we would not have taken the case.",
  "I'm sorry. Maybe --",
  "Excuse me, please. The second point?",
  "Counsel, I guess your opponent could have raised that point.",
  "And didn't raise it.",
  "And we took this case on the assumption that there is an issue of law involved --",
  "-- and not -- not on the assumption that --",
  "You say, \"they.\" I assume you mean their lawyer?",
  "This is not -- you know, an ignorant layman who knows nothing about the law.",
  "The lawyer, you say, did not ask for the plan.",
  "That's -- that's not unusual. The motto is equity follows the law. Doesn't -- doesn't that usually -- isn't that usually the case?",
  "Where there is a legal right, equity cannot overcome it.",
  "Equitable powers to enforce the agreement?",
  "Well, I think you can say that about any legal rule, that some courts bollox them up. I mean, that means the rule doesn't exist because it's sometimes used in a confusing way?",
  "What's the rule? What's the rule? Do you acknowledge that that is the rule?",
  "Was there an agreement that contradicted that?",
  "Well, but we have an agreement here, so how does -- how does that line of authority apply?",
  "We have an agreement, which says that the insurance company gets all the money. So you either say that that agreement can be overcome by equity, or else, you -- you say the agreement prevails.",
  "But it only has the powers to enforce the agreement.",
  "There are various equitable powers, and it can use various of them to enforce the agreement.",
  "That's quite different from rewriting the agreement, which is what you are using it for here.",
  "Excuse me. Do you really think that if -- if an equity court finds the agreement to be unfair, it can say, he who seeks equity must do equity, and rewrite the agreement, so that it's fairer?",
  "We never doubted that before. Was it thought before that all the equitable powers did not exist under ERISA?",
  "It seems to be self-evident that the court had all equitable powers. That's not a change in the law. It's just a restatement of the obvious.",
  "Your opponent says this is not a subrogation agreement, so that argument goes nowhere. He would concede that point. You have to tell us why this is a subrogation agreement, even though you conceded below that it isn't.",
  "That's not what I say you've conceded. That's the common fund doctrine. Your opponent denies that the common fund doctrine applies. And it says this is an equitable lien by agreement, so that the common fund doctrine doesn't apply. Now, you -- you say it is not an equitable lien by agreement? Is that your position?",
  "So whenever you have a contract that explicitly, although -- you know, nowadays when the merged bars, I suppose, you wouldn't even have to say it, but let's assume it explicitly says that rights under this contract can be enforced in law or -- at law or in equity. Whenever -- whenever you have a contract like that, it's going to be up to the court of equity to decide whether it's fair?",
  "Why isn't this a legal claim? It's -- it's a promise made in a contract. Why -- why is that not a legal claim? To be sure, the contract says that -- that -- you know, all equitable remedies are available to enforce that claim. But why is it an equitable claim, not a legal claim?",
  "What -- what case is this?",
  "From what court, what -- what year?",
  "What -- what about the time they come up here? 52(b) applies to every court, does it not?",
  "So suppose there's been -- been no objection to a uncertain question of -- on an uncertain question of law until the case gets here. Can -- can counsel argue that this Court should nonetheless review the case because, if we agree with counsel, thereupon, the law would be clear? When we issued our decision, the law would be clear.",
  "I -- I wonder how we would go about deciding whether we would take such a case or not. We'd take all -- all those cases where counsel says, I didn't -- we didn't raise any of these objections, neither in the court of appeals nor in the district court; but, if you agree -- if you agree with me, Your Honors, that the law is thus and so, once you say that, that will make the decisions below clear error, and, therefore, you should be able to reverse it. Makes sense, right?",
  "But when, as is the situation in this case, the law is uncertain at the time of trial, and there are some circuits that have gone one way, some circuits that have gone the other way, surely it greatly serves efficiency to bring that situation to the attention of the judge. He has a 50 percent chance of getting it right. And if he gets it right, then the case is done. Instead, your -- your client did not raise any objection, and the judge just went ahead. Now, if -- if the error was plain, you can say, well, he didn't need an objection, any -- any dumb judge would have -- would have known this. Okay? So you make that kind of an exception. But I don't see the reason for making that exception, where you could have brought this to the judge's attention, and he could have solved the problem; or, if he didn't solve it, maybe the prosecutor could have, by making some alteration in what he was demanding as a -- as a punishment or whatever. That -- that seems to me such a -- such a clear efficiency in the system. I don't know what the efficiency is when you do it at the court of appeals level. All you tell me is that, well, it saves you the trouble of going back and figuring out what -- what the situation was at the trial -- at the time of trial, right? But you've got to go back to the time of trial anyway to decide whether -- whether substantial rights have been affected, don't you?",
  "But -- but there's -- this brings you back to Justice Alito's question. There's always an injustice when the district court has gotten it wrong. The district court got it wrong, applied the wrong rule. Justice has not been served. But we don't say, we want to do justice. We say, we're only going to do justice if it was clear. Now, why -- why would you -- why would you have that limitation on it? The only -- the only reason that limitation makes sense to me is -- is because when it is clear, it doesn't have to be raised below. The judge ought to know better, anyway, and so you're not sacrificing any efficiency. But if the whole purpose of it is just to do justice, I don't understand the reason for the clear limitation. Why should it only be when it's clear?",
  "That's okay.",
  "Why -- why is that so? Why is that so? Why does -- does the effect upon the fairness of the proceedings change when it's sentencing or when it's the merits? I don't understand that.",
  "You're -- you're here complaining about sentencing. That's a substantial issue, isn't it?",
  "I can -- I can also not imagine a lawyer who intentionally makes that decision. That -- that lawyer is a unicorn, I suppose. But I think there are a lot of lawyers who will not be as careful about finding all of the issues that they should bring to the court's attention, perhaps be unaware of a statute that they should have been aware of. If -- if we -- if we adopt the rule that's being urged by the Petitioner here, it does affect attorney behavior for the attorney to know that stuff that he -- he ought to know but doesn't know will -- will not be able to be patched up on appeal.",
  "Well, more than that, Johnson stood on its head, did it not, not to decide the case the easy way, which was simply to say if it's clear on appeal, the rule applies. It could have said that. The case would have been very easy. It -- it instead avoided that by saying, oh, well, this is a very special case. Well, it wouldn't be a special case if -- if the argument presented by the Petitioner here were accepted. I don't -- far from -- far from appearing that Johnson supports Petitioner's case, I think Johnson tends to undermine it.",
  "Absolutely. I mean, that -- that argument applies to whether the error was plain or not. Apply the law as it is.",
  "I agree that that was a bad footnote. I think you're -- you know...",
  "I joined Johnson, and maybe I have to repudiate it if it leads -- leads to that conclusion.",
  "Oh, I didn't? Oh, thank God.",
  "It didn't sound like me. I believe in the slippery slope. And we're proving that today, aren't we?",
  "Mr. Mann, could -- could I come back to your response to the question of Knox -- the statement in Knox that -- you know, where the court can issue -- can provide no relief, there is -- there is no standing. That -- I would have thought your answer to that is -- is not -- I mean, you -- you answered it on the facts, but that statement was not meant to be exclusive, that that's the only situation in which there -- there is no standing. It was addressing just the third prong of our -- of our standing doctrine, namely the prong that, where the court can issue no relief, the remedial -- the remedial prong, that one of -- one of the elements of standing is the court has to be able to provide relief. But there are other elements to standing as well, including whether there is injury, in fact, and whether the injury is -- you know, springs from the action that is challenged. And those -- those prongs would continue to exist. I didn't think Knox's statement was meant to be all-inclusive, that that's the only -- only way in which standing can be eliminated.",
  "Equity is wonderful.",
  "I'll bet you equity could have considered the husband to have been substituted automatically and could have considered that -- the estate to have been substituted automatically. That -- that happens when -- when that particular element is -- is eliminated. But there is nothing automatic about discovering some new plaintiff who -- who is out -- we don't know who is out there.",
  "Well, it undermines the collective aspect, if she never brings the suit in the first place. I mean, I -- I must say I'm -- I'm not terribly impressed by the fact that -- you know, if she drops out there is -- there is no collective suit for these other people. There is also no collective suit for these other people if she never appeared in the first place. I don't -- I don't know that the law demands that there be a collective suit. If she doesn't bring suit or if she brings suit and -- and is given everything she wants, the case is over, unless other people have come in.",
  "It -- it's hard for me to accept the relation-back doctrine for your purposes when -- when it's clear, under the statute, that if parties come in beyond the statute of limitations period, they're not in. Their -- their entry is not deemed to relate back to the filing of the original complaint, is it?",
  "For purposes of the statute of -- so you want one relation-back doctrine for the statute and a different one for what we're discussing here.",
  "I know you do.",
  "Mr. Yang, would -- would you continue with what you started speaking to, issue preclusion, because I'm -- I'm also -- I think it's questionable whether there would be issue preclusion on the basis of a judgment issued with the concession of the defendant.",
  "That's usually the objective.",
  "What if -- what if the rule is held invalid? I mean, we don't know the answer to that question until this rule is challenged, and there is ultimately a -- I'm sure it will be challenged because their position is that the -- this rule contradicts the statute. So how does that factor in to your analysis?",
  "I understand that, but my point is, until that suit is -- is concluded, you don't know whether there is a possibility of future violation or not, do you?",
  "What do you mean, \"active\"? What does that mean?",
  "They -- they cut maybe, what, every -- every 10 years? Is that active?",
  "What about the 9 years in-between? Are they being actively used?",
  "I'm looking at page 7, and it doesn't say the authority to designate additional roads. It says additional stormwater discharges.",
  "That could be stormwater discharges that have nothing to do with logging.",
  "Yes, they -- they are just intervening. It's -- it's not like what happens in the -- in the suits for fraud against the government, where they take over the litigation.",
  "They don't take it over. They just intervene.",
  "Mr. Kneedler, you -- what I find incompatible in your argument is you -- you assert that this is a jurisdictional limitation.",
  "Can you think of any other instance in which we have found something to be a jurisdictional limitation and allowed the person or agency, subject to that limitation, to extend it? I -- I had always thought that once you say it's jurisdictional, it means you have to abide by it.",
  "Well, if there is another statutory provision, then that -- then that statutory extension is part of the jurisdictional limitation. That's fine. But when you just have a jurisdictional 180 days, without any statutory provision for extension, if it's jurisdictional, I thought that's the end of the game.",
  "Undoubtedly. But have any jurisdictional time limitations?",
  "The problem with taking that approach, of course -- and I assume why you assert that it's jurisdictional, is that there is a long history of both the board and the Secretary regarding this as jurisdictional.",
  "They have said it.",
  "Of course, nobody -- nobody intends that when they -- when they adopt an absolute rule. I mean, you -- you can create a horrible with respect to any absolute jurisdictional rule. That's easy to do. So the mere fact that -- that a horrible could occur does -- does not at all persuade me that -- that a rule is not absolute.",
  "Of course -- of course, one can always make an argument on the other side, and the mere fact that an argument is made on the other side does not prove that it's not clear. That's what lawyers do. They make arguments on the other side.",
  "I thought the 3 years provision applied only to the Secretary, that she gives herself 3 years to go back and sort things out, but only gives you 180 days; is that right?",
  "Is that reopening -- is that reopening provision, the mysterious gg, is -- is that subject to equitable tolling, too?",
  "And if not, why not?",
  "Mr. Coates, I am -- I am still perplexed.",
  "You say -- and it seems to be correct, that each -- each alleged polluter is only responsible for his own pollution. But you also say that these monitors are so situated that it is impossible to tell from the monitor who is responsible for the pollution; is that right?",
  "So whose fault is that?",
  "What -- what it is -- what is it that provides for that?",
  "Is -- is your description of the statute meant to conclude, or does it -- does it conclude, that these outsource monitoring stations which exist under the new permit are not really required?",
  "Oh, I understood that. Yes.",
  "Can you put in the permit stuff that the statute does not require?",
  "Okay.",
  "So -- so -- so what follows from that; that the district is liable because it's a lousy permit?",
  "I do not see how this court -- how the -- how the court of appeals is going to be able to do anything different, other than say there's no liability here, unless, of course, it adopts another fanciful interpretation of the statute, which is something I worry about.",
  "I -- I agree with that, but how can this permit possibly be interpreted in such a way as to hold a district liable?",
  "They would assume that; but, if it doesn't, it doesn't.",
  "So what do you do if it doesn't?",
  "They have -- they have not agreed.",
  "So you're going to impose a shared thing? I see no way for the court of appeals to do this in -- in a fashion that will not bring the case right back here, and you'll be asking us to send it back to the same panel.",
  "But that is not our ordinary practice, when -- when nothing can happen on remand, except -- except to give judgment for the Petitioners here.",
  "Wait. But -- but before you go further, it says each permittee must comply. It doesn't say that each permittee shall be responsible or shall be liable. And it's the other provision that says that each permittee is responsible only for a discharge for which it is the operator.",
  "So you got more --",
  "-- more besides 195.",
  "Of course, the very first step is A, \"Upon a determination by either the permittee or the regional board that discharges are causing or contributing to an exceedance of an applicable water quality standard, the permittee shall promptly notify,\" et cetera. They cannot make such a determination because of the nature of the monitoring -- monitoring here.",
  "What's the third section, Mr. Colangelo? I'm waiting breathlessly for your third section. You said there were three.",
  "I've got 195. I've got 98. Where is the third one?",
  "Well, why -- why do you need that if -- if the present permit covers it as clearly as you say? I mean self -- self-monitoring.",
  "My goodness, you're going to go through all of this how many -- how long did it take you to challenge this and blah, blah, blah, blah? Why go through all that if, indeed, the present permit, as you say, is perfectly adequate?",
  "Mr. Colangelo, did you raise this argument in your brief in opposition?",
  "Where is it in that? I was looking for it.",
  "But that -- That may be, but you don't support -- and page what?",
  "But you don't --",
  "-- you don't say that that's the basis for supporting the decision below. I certainly didn't interpret it.",
  "I don't have your supplemental brief in front of me.",
  "Well -- but -- but that -- that's just to say you can rely on -- on the extant monitors.",
  "So you say -- you know, they were correct. You have to find some basis for liability, and they use the monitors, and that's it. It didn't -- it didn't say, in detail, that these people had to go and -- and set up their own monitoring under -- under the permit.",
  "You -- you told this to the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit said no?",
  "Finish that. So what's the consequence of that?",
  "Therefore, each one of them is liable for all of it?",
  "But they haven't done so. So what?",
  "I don't understand why you didn't cross-appeal on -- on this theory that -- that the lower court rejected.",
  "I didn't say you need to. I didn't say you needed to. But I -- I would normally have done it, just to be sure I had that arrow in my quiver and that it would not be argued, as it will be here, that this would be expanding the judgment below.",
  "What if this panel found – found for you on the ground that they used, they will surely find for you on this other ground, which --",
  "-- which has at least an inkling of plausibility.",
  "Did we use our usual language, and did it go back, and the -- and the court of appeals considered --",
  "-- considered the issue we had refused to consider?",
  "Okay.",
  "Don't we have two -- I don't know that we do this all the time. When we expect them to keep the case and do something different, don't we usually vacate and remand, rather than reverse?",
  "But they might change their mind now. They might change their mind.",
  "And the Alabama court would not have jurisdiction if the child had been wrongfully removed?",
  "Is that what you're saying?",
  "Wait, wait, wait. The opinion below has been vacated.",
  "So there's -- there's nothing which says that this child -- this child's habitual residence was -- was in the U.K.",
  "That being the case, the only question is will the Alabama court proceed, even -- assuming that it finds the child's habitual residence was in Alabama, would it proceed, even if the child had been taken out of the jurisdiction? And I understand that it would.",
  "There hasn't been. There hasn't been. It's been vacated. It's as though it never happened.",
  "Well, that's bad law. I mean -- you mean the Alabama court is bound by a vacated decision of a Federal court? My goodness, I never heard of anything like that.",
  "I don't understand your answer.",
  "What is your -- I don't understand that answer. Are you -- are you saying that -- that your failure to appeal that in a timely fashion makes it impossible for the Court of Appeals to obliterate that award?",
  "Well, that's -- that's what I thought the question was.",
  "Well, then -- then retain your tunnel vision. And don't say that the case remains non-moot simply because of this other issue. The other issue is either in the case or out of the case. Now, is it part of your case?",
  "Well, I mean, that's lovely, but -- so you are saying that you don't have to appeal that separately; is that what you're saying?",
  "But you've got to answer my question.",
  "Do you have to appeal that separately or not? If -- if the way you answered Justice Alito's question was -- was the way you did, you are saying that it's unnecessary to appeal that monetary aspect of the judgment separately, that it goes -- it goes with the rest of it. Is that -- is that your position?",
  "I think you're saying it doesn't have to be appealed separately.",
  "But you could bring a Hague proceeding there, right?",
  "You could say -- you know, there having been no decision in the United States, we want you to decide what habitual residence is, and we think it's the United States. You could do that.",
  "But we don't know it'll make a difference without answering those questions.",
  "I mean, you want us to -- to say it might make a difference, and that's enough, right?",
  "Well, you should put it that way, then. It doesn't -- you don't know that it makes a difference, but you don't have to know, right?",
  "Well, that's lovely, but there wasn't a stay here. So what do you do when that procedure hasn't been followed? That's the issue that we're presented with.",
  "And do we even know that a stay would have been appropriate here?",
  "So presumably, a stay would not have been appropriate.",
  "Counsel, that's very nice. What does that have to do with this case? I don't understand that.",
  "Well, the burden is different, but I don't agree that the standard changes. It's just who has to prove it, one side or the other. But I --",
  "I thought he had said the same thing, that the reason --",
  "Well, good.",
  "So are you arguing that the effect of the statute implementing the treaty, which uses \"forthwith\" and all of this, is to, in effect, require that, unless there is a motion for a stay pending, the decision of the trial court be carried out?",
  "You -- you think the -- the mere word \"forthwith\" in the statute is enough to alter our normal process of appeal?",
  "I thought -- I thought that's what you were saying.",
  "Yes, but under the traditional -- you surely don't want us to apply the rules of the traditional diversity statute to this case because it's clear that under the traditional diversity statute, you -- you can waive excessive damages, right?",
  "So you don't want us to apply that rule here.",
  "Or the State court could find, oh yes, it is -- the claim is worth a lot more than 5 million, but it's worth that amount to be in this generous court for these generous juries. And so you're really not harming these absent plaintiffs because they ought to want to be here. We've got juries and very favorable judges. Couldn't it find that?",
  "I understand it, but -- but I'm just addressing your point which you blithely say, if the -- if the representation is inadequate, if indeed it's worth a lot more, that will be handled. Not necessarily. The State court could find, and I suspect this State court would find, that it's worth the money to be in State court.",
  "But I thought our cases held that when you have a conviction for a weapons violation, you can look to the Shepard materials to decide whether, in fact, the weapon violation was a gun, a knife or an ax, can't you? No?",
  "Or if -- you acknowledge if the State supreme court says \"weapon\" could mean a -- a gun, a knife or a hatchet, that would -- that would suffice, right? But if the supreme court doesn't say that, we cannot imagine it?",
  "It's not spelled out as an element, but the State supreme court says, our statute says weapon. Of course, a weapon could be a gun, a knife, or a hatchet, and then we look to the Shepard documents and we find that this conviction of a weapon violation was in fact based on the possession of a gun.",
  "I think what you're saying is, it -- it could necessarily have been found by the jury, but he would nevertheless not have been convicted of that particular crime.",
  "The jury in finding him guilty of the generic offense could only have found that this mode of committing the offense was what he used. Nonetheless, he has not been convicted of using that mode; he has been convicted of the generic offense. Isn't that your point.",
  "Maybe -- maybe they haven't argued it because there's some serious constitutional doubt about whether the statute which makes it a crime to engage in conduct which creates a serious risk of physical injury is constitutional. That's such a vague standard, you go to prison for 30 years if you engage in conduct, quote, \"that creates a serious risk of physical injury.\" I'm not about to buy into that one.",
  "It seems strange to me at all. He hasn't been convicted of raping or having intercourse with somebody under -- under 14 or under 15.",
  "He's only been convicted of having that with someone under 18.",
  "Not everything the jury finds constitutes a conviction. They have to find something that is an element of the charged offense.",
  "If being -- being under 16 is not -- or 14, whatever it is, is not an element of the charged offense, I don't care what the jury finds.",
  "Qui tacet consentire videtur. Why don't you quote the maxim?",
  "He who remains silent appears to consent.",
  "And then advise defendants who -- who anticipate committing these crimes, so that they will know which crimes carry another 30 years.",
  "Well, you don't have to prove -- I mean, burglary is specifically named. It's not -- it's not the residual --",
  "It's not the residual. The -- the use or threatened use of force is the residual. If you're convicted of burglary, it doesn't matter whether -- whether you threaten force, right?",
  "Do you think only -- only those burglaries that -- that threaten force are covered by the statute? Certainly not. It's all burglaries, as long as you meet the generic definition of burglary, right?",
  "Mr. -- Mr. Liman, you acknowledge that a civil action could be brought beginning from the time when the injured plaintiff discovers the fraud, right?",
  "So you're really not arguing for what you might call a total statute of repose. It seems to me odd that the defendant would be relieved from prosecution by the government, but not relieved from a suit for sometimes very substantial damages by -- by an injured plaintiff who doesn't have to sue until he's discovered the fraud.",
  "Sure. But that 5 years doesn't begin to run until the private plaintiff discovers the fraud, right?",
  "No?",
  "I don't think the common law held that it didn't accrue. I think it was an exception to the accrual rule, that, even though it accrued earlier, we are going to allow a later suit where -- where discovery is made later. I -- is that the way those cases were framed, that it didn't accrue until discovery?",
  "Well, you are making the argument, so you ought to fight about it.",
  "And never in a criminal case, right? Do you have a single case in which the discovery rule was -- was applied in a criminal case with respect to a penalty or a criminal sanction?",
  "Not a single one.",
  "You'd expect that - you'd expect there to be some cases in a couple of hundred years.",
  "Fraud is nothing new, for Pete's sake.",
  "This is brand-new assertion by the government that -- tell -- is there much difference between the rule you are arguing for and a rule that there is no statute of limitations?",
  "It's not a matter of there being nothing on either side of the ledger. What's extraordinary is that the government has never asserted this, except in the 19th century, when it was rebuffed and -- and repudiated its position. It isn't just that there are no cases against you. It's you've never -- the government has never asserted it before.",
  "The False Claims Act example you give is indeed a private plaintiff kind of a case.",
  "Yes, you can say the government, having been cheated, should have known it was cheated. But we are talking here about prosecution, essentially, prosecution for a civil penalty rather than a criminal. By the way, doesn't the rule of lenity apply whether the penalty is criminal or civil? So if I think the word \"accrual\" is, at best, ambiguous, shouldn't the tie go to the defendant?",
  "But my question is broader than that. Does the rule of lenity not apply to all penalties?",
  "Are you sure of that? My belief is the contrary.",
  "Well, it's an important issue in this case, surely. I mean, if \"accrual\" is ambiguous and we have a rule of lenity, we should interpret it to favor the defendant.",
  "He didn't concede that there was fraudulent concealment. All he conceded is that there was fraud, but later concealment to cover up that fraud I don't think has been conceded.",
  "Except that concealment is sort -- you know, it's sort of a self-starter. You -- you -- it -- it doesn't apply always. It applies when there is concealment, and the person who is being subjected to the longer statute of limitations is on notice that if he fraudulently conceals, he's extending the statute. So I -- I don't think that the one has to go with the other. Maybe they're both equitable doctrines, but that doesn't -- that doesn't mean that we have to apply them to this statute.",
  "And for 300 years, that has been said only with respect to civil actions, not with respect to the government's attempt to exact a penalty.",
  "And you will say nonsense in that future case, won't you?",
  "What about criminal penalties? Would your argument be different with regard to criminal?",
  "Incidentally, what makes something a civil penalty? You just call it a civil penalty and -- and you don't have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, and you get the benefit of this extension that you are arguing for?",
  "What makes -- what makes a penalty a civil penalty?",
  "I mean, a penalty is a penalty as far as I'm concerned if the government's taking money from me.",
  "That's nice.",
  "That isn't my point, that it is criminal. My point is, it doesn't seem to me to make a whole lot of difference as far as these issues are concerned.",
  "They must allocate? Is the State saying, You do not own that 30 percent of the recovery, so you never get a property right in it, so that there's never any problem about asserting a lien against it? I thought that's what's going on here. And I think that's sort of disguised by talking about allocation. I thought the State is saying, as to 30 percent of the recovery, you have no property right in it. Is it not saying that? Am I wrong?",
  "Maybe -- maybe you didn't hear my -- my question. My question is: Is the State saying that you have no property right in the 30 percent?",
  "Let me ask my question again. Is the State saying that you have no property right in the 30 percent? I think that can be answered \"yes\" or \"no.\"",
  "You can bind the parties for other purposes, I assume. There are other purposes for which the distinction between pain and suffering and medical expenses might make a difference, right? What -- what if the parties agreed that it's 50/50? Would the State take 50 percent then, or is the State still limited to 30?",
  "Okay.",
  "Don't you think the statute may -- may give you the answer? It says: \"Any attorney retained by the beneficiary shall out of the proceeds obtained on behalf of the beneficiary by settlement with, judgment against, or otherwise from a third party by reason of injury or death distribute to the department the amount of assistance paid by the department on behalf of...up to 33 percent.\" It applies to judgments as well as to settlements.",
  "Why? I don't understand that. You see, I think the only way you can defend it is that -- is that the recipient never -- never had a property right. Once -- once recovery is given to the recipient, the recovery does not belong to the recipient. And if that's true for 33 percent, it can be through -- true for 100 percent. Has there ever been any litigation since 1935 about takings problems, with -- with the State requiring 33 percent to go to the medical provider, even though it may well be that -- that less or more of that amount went to medical damages --",
  "Yes, but that doesn't answer the question. I mean that portion, according to North Carolina, is one-third.",
  "Yes, but what the State says is the law. I mean, the State says one-third is for medical.",
  "So you need, ultimately you need an adjudication. You have to leave it either to a jury to decide what percentage of the total award is -- is medical expenses or have a separate proceeding. Let's say where there has been a settlement, you need a separate proceeding to decide how much of it is really for medical. You know, they may say 10 percent is, but who believes that? You -- you need a proceeding. That is awfully time-consuming. And -- and as Justice Kagan suggests, I'm not sure it's going to be very accurate. I don't think a jury determination is going to be -- is going to be accurate on that score. And I don't know how you go about determining how much of a settlement is attributable to -- to medical expenses versus other things, especially when the settlement itself says only 10 percent is medical expenses.",
  "How do you do that?",
  "I don't understand. What do you adjudicate? What is the issue in the adjudication? How much of the award should have been allocated to medical expenses, or how much of the award was, in fact, allocated to medical expenses? Which is the issue?",
  "It seems to me it should be the latter, shouldn't it?",
  "That's right. How much was allocated, right? It doesn't matter what ought to have been. The issue is what proportion did the parties in fact allocate to medical expenses, right?",
  "And they say 1 penny. How are you going to contradict that?",
  "No, no. But that's --",
  "You know, putting -- putting it in the discretion of the court, as you say is done in the workmen's compensation, is quite different from what you're proposing here. That seems to me quite workable -- you know. The -- the court hears the evidence and he decides how much should be reimbursed within -- within the court's discretion. But here, you're -- you're asking a court to decide how much of a recovery or how much of a settlement was attributable to -- to the medical portion.",
  "That's a totally different question.",
  "But it would be the defendant who's -- who's -- who's jiggering the system, I mean, not suing for the medical portion simply because the defendant knows that at least some of that portion, if not all of it, would -- would go -- would go to the State. So, in a situation, such as yours, where the total recovery is -- is not going to suffice to cover both pain and suffering and medical expenses, it'd be very intelligent to do what Justice Alito proposed. And that seems to me a real, I don't know, gaming -- gaming of the system.",
  "Excuse me. I have a -- I have a theoretical problem right at the outset. I mean, what the statute forbids is asserting a lien on recovery that is for medical expenses. And you're telling me that the States aren't even trying to find out what portion of the recovery was for medical expenses. They're looking to determine what proportion should have been for medical expenses. How does that tie in with the -- with the prohibition of the lien?",
  "So -- so you're saying that the State can, in making this determination, in fact take away from a plaintiff who has recovered a -- a greater amount in medical expenses, or a lesser amount in medical expenses, can take -- take away that by determining how much should have been allocated to medical expenses, right?",
  "So you're messing up the lien law anyway, no matter which way you play it.",
  "I'm not sure that HHS has -- has authority over -- over how a State recovers. I don't see that it's part of the administration of the statute committed to HHS. So I -- you know, I admire you're not citing Chevron.",
  "Why don't you force him to take the breathalyzer test, instead of forcing him to have a needle shoved in his -- in his arm?",
  "What -- what is the difference between the reliability or the acceptability by juries of a breathalyzer test, as opposed to a blood draw?",
  "Of course we don't know why they disapproved. And I guess your point is they may well not have permitted it because they were under what you would call the mistaken belief that it was unconstitutional.",
  "Mr. Koester, in most jurisdictions, unless I'm mistaken, the cop on the beat cannot apply for and get a search warrant. He has to go through a prosecuting attorney or someone in the prosecutor's office first. So it's not just getting hold of a judge. It's getting hold of the prosecutor first and then getting hold of the judge if the prosecutor approves it, right?",
  "Is that the case in Missouri?",
  "But -- I mean, once we say that you don't need a warrant -- you know, even if things improve, the game's up, right? No?",
  "You mean somebody can come up 10 years from now and say, although you approved it 10 years ago without a warrant, things have changed, so now you need a warrant?",
  "But if that's the case, then why shouldn't that determination be made case by case?",
  "Case by case, whether in fact it would have taken that long to get a warrant? And if it -- if it would have taken too long, then it's okay without a warrant. If it wouldn't have taken that long, it's bad.",
  "Totality of the circumstances test, right?",
  "That doesn't mean that it was enough, either, right?",
  "Counsel for Missouri tells us, Ms. Saharsky, that the breathalyzer is just as good and that in fact he expects that the consequence of our ruling in his favor in this case will be that drunken drivers will agree to the breathalyzer test. But I don't know why it isn't adequate to produce that result simply to put the drunken driver in a -- in a paddy wagon and on the way to the hospital say -- you know, we're going to be in the hospital in 20 minutes; we're applying for a warrant; when we get there, we're going to -- we're going to -- you know, stick a needle in your arm, unless, of course, you agree to take the breathalyzer test. Why isn't that enough to -- to force them into the breathalyzer test, so that they will blow up the balloon.",
  "Is this a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing? I mean, what -- what advantage do you think your client would -- would really get from the warrant requirement other than the delay that that would entail allowing his blood alcohol to reduce itself? Are the -- for some warrants, let's say a warrant to go into a building where the police contend there may be drugs, the policeman will -- will you know, the magistrate will say, What evidence do you have that there's drugs? Well -- you know, two weeks ago we had this informer, yesterday we saw this and so -- you know, all sorts of different factors. In these DUI cases it's always going to be the same thing. The policeman is going to say, well -- you know, his breath smelled of alcohol; we gave him the walk a straight line and turn around test, he flunked it; he couldn't touch his nose with his index finger. What is the impartial magistrate possibly going to do except to say, hey -- you know, that's probable cause. Are any of these warrants ever turned down? Are they ever turned down in your experience?",
  "I bet you they're not.",
  "But in many of them there is a lot of judgment that has to be brought to bear: Is this a reliable informant, how long ago did he tell you, and so forth. Whereas, in all of these cases it's going to be the same thing: His breath smelled of alcohol, he couldn't walk a straight line, and whatnot. And -- and that's the probable cause. And I don't see how the independent magistrate is going to do you a whole lot of good, except for the fact that it will delay the process.",
  "It bears considerably on the reasonableness, doesn't it? I don't know why you want to bite off more than you can chew.",
  "It's a different case and what is reasonable for sticking a needle in your arm is not necessarily reasonable for asking you to blow up a balloon.",
  "I thought -- I thought you would also distinguish the drug flush cases on -- on the ground that violation of the integrity of your home is somewhat less than violation of the integrity of your body.",
  "And that goes into the reasonableness determination.",
  "What is -- what is south? I don't have a compass here.",
  "It's not just that language. It's \"investigation in anticipation of litigation.\" If I understand you correctly, you are saying investigation includes solicitation.",
  "Isn't that your position?",
  "I don't -- I don't think that is fair. I think their position is, to harmonize (b)(4) and (b)(12), you have to interpret investigation, not to include solicitation, because, otherwise, you have a conflict, that (b)(12) prohibits solicitation, unless you have the consent; whereas, (b)(4), which says, \"investigation,\" does not require consent. Now, the two exist in perfect harmony if investigation does not include solicitation, but there -- there is a discrepancy between the two if it does include solicitation. And you have to say, well, this is an exception from (b)(12).",
  "They're north of that line, right?",
  "I don't know which is specific and which is general. I mean, that's the problem I have with that.",
  "I don't understand what you're saying. You're saying the State Bar requirements would have required you to say, are you interested in joining the lawsuit?",
  "Yes.",
  "North of trolling?",
  "You haven't distinguished McMillan. You've distinguished Harris. How do you distinguish McMillan? Your -- your only grounds for distinguishing that is it was not a Sixth Amendment case, even though the opinion refers to the Sixth Amendment?",
  "I don't care about \"mostly.\" The issue is whether McMillan was a Sixth Amendment case, in part or in whole. And I don't know how you can say it wasn't. We -- we don't decide cases on -- on what a case mostly says. We decide on what it says.",
  "Why wouldn't that be a problem if -- if the question had to be decided by the jury? Why does -- why does requiring it to be decided by the jury eliminate that -- that problem of the -- of the mixing or not mixing?",
  "Ms. Maguire, could -- could you repeat the first sentence you uttered in this argument? I -- I hesitated to jump in so early, but could you repeat it verbatim? Maybe you had committed it to memory. Good -- good counsel often does that.",
  "No, that wasn't it.",
  "I think what you said was who has to decide a fact which causes a defendant to be subject to a penalty that he would not otherwise be subject to? And the fact is that, in the case of a mandatory minimum, the defendant could have been given that mandatory minimum. It was up to the judge. So this mandatory minimum does not increase the penalty to which the defendant is subject. He's subject, in Justice Kagan's example, to any penalty between one years -- one year and 10. The judge, even without the statute that she mentioned, could have given him seven years because he -- he brandished a gun. There -- there is really no -- no increase in the penalty to which he is exposed. And I thought that is what Apprendi addressed, any increase in the penalty to which you are exposed, so that when you decide, I'm going to rob a bank -- you know -- you know, when you go in, you are going to get between one and 10 years, and, with a mandatory minimum, you get between one and 10 years. So what's the complaint, as far as Apprendi is concerned?",
  "It isn't leading to a more harsh -- more harsh sentence. That's the whole point of Apprendi. Does it lead to a sentence which is greater than the judge would otherwise be authorized to impose? And, in the case of a mandatory minimum, it never is. The judge could impose that, if he was a hanging judge. You know, you have some hanging judges; you have some bleeding heart judges. And -- and what a mandatory minimum simply says is -- you know, we don't care what kind of a judge you are, at least this much. But it doesn't expose the defendant to any greater penalty. He's -- he's at risk between one and 10 years.",
  "That seems to me - -",
  "But you -- you quoted Apprendi correctly as saying that the jury has to decide any fact which increases the sentence to which the defendant is exposed. That's the language you quoted, and it's accurate. Why does a mandatory minimum increase the sentence to which the defendant is exposed? He could get the mandatory minimum sentence, even if there were no mandatory minimum prescribed. He is exposed to a sentence of one to 10 years. A mandatory minimum says, you must impose seven years if he brandishes. But the sentence to which he is exposed is one to 10 years. And the mandatory minimum does not change that at all. He is at risk for one to 10 years.",
  "That's true.",
  "That's true. But you must acknowledge that that's not the theory of Apprendi.",
  "I think the logic of Apprendi is that the jury has to decide it if it increases the sentence to which the defendant is exposed, not if it eliminates some discretion of the -- of the Court. He's exposed.",
  "It wasn't a mandatory minimum case. Booker was a case in which the maximum was increased on the basis of judge finding of fact. The maximum was increased. So, under the situation in Booker, the -- the exposure of the defendant was, indeed, increased on the basis of judge factfinding. Instead of one to 10, the statute in -- in Booker said, if you brandish a gun, you can get 15. That's a -- that's a quite different situation from saying, yes, you are still on the hook for one to 10, but, if you brandish, you got to get 7.",
  "What page? What page?",
  "I wonder who -- I wonder who that could have been.",
  "But is it the usual case that a judge, when faced with this decision, has before him a jury finding? I -- that --",
  "The Petitioner is asking these cases to be thrown out, even if there has been no jury finding.",
  "And the judge says -- you know, I have to decide whether he brandished or not; I think he brandished. But I -- you know, the Petitioner here wants to say, the judge cannot consider himself bound by a mandatory minimum. It seems to me the unusual case in which you have a jury finding, that the judge must ignore in -- in -- he actually doesn't ignore it, he goes along with it. The jury may well be right, that it's impossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that -- that the felon brandished a gun, but it's -- it -- it's quite easy to say that it's very likely he branded a gun -- brandished a gun, which is what the judge has to find. So he -- he's not even ignoring the jury finding.",
  "Mr. Dreeben, I think that history is wrong. In fact, the way the country started, there was no judicial discretion. There were simply fixed penalties for crimes. If you stole a horse, you were guilty of a felony, and you would be hanged. That's where we started.",
  "And I would think that the risk involved is whether, if we come out the way that the Petitioner here urges us to do, legislatures will consider going back to -- to where we started from and simply saying, if you brandish, you get seven years, period, with no discretion in the judge. That, it seems to me, is the greater risk.",
  "I'm sorry. I didn't hear your last word. Those would be?",
  "It is so bad he wants to extend it.",
  "Mr. Bourke, was -- was it within the control of your client?",
  "Was he unable to get his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial?",
  "Why?",
  "He had -- he had one counsel, right? During the whole time?",
  "Yes. For part of it, he had two, and then there was not enough funding for the second, okay? So he was faced with a choice. Louisiana, as I understand it, has adopted a provision, which the Sixth Amendment does not require. The Sixth Amendment just requires counsel, but Louisiana says, in capital cases, we are going to provide two counsel, and you can't go to trial until you have two counsel, okay?",
  "No?",
  "What is the State of Louisiana law?",
  "Well, I don't -- I don't understand that. That's not Louisiana law that you -- that you can't proceed without two counsel? That's not the law in Louisiana? I thought that's --",
  "I -- you don't consider supreme court rules to be law?",
  "Is it the fact that, in Louisiana, you cannot proceed to trial in a capital case, unless there are two counsel?",
  "Then -- then you don't have a case. You should have proceeded to trial.",
  "Wasn't there, at all times, one counsel who was being paid by the State?",
  "At all times?",
  "Was that counsel qualified enough under our constitutional Sixth Amendment jurisprudence?",
  "Well --",
  "Well, the question is would only lead counsel under -- under the supreme court's rule qualify as competent counsel, for purposes of complying with the constitutional requirement? Or would this certified second chair qualify?",
  "Exactly. I'm just saying can you establish that the one counsel that your client had throughout this whole -- whole proceeding would not satisfy the constitutional requirement? Can you -- is there any basis for your saying that?",
  "What?",
  "Not because of a Federal constitutional reason. The court found, you are not complying with the supreme court rule. You can't proceed without complying with the supreme court rule. It seems to me your client was faced with a choice: You could either demand what Louisiana, in its generosity, has given to capital defendants, namely, the right to two counsel -- whether it's by statute or by supreme court rule, it doesn't matter -- you could either demand that right; or you could demand your right to a speedy trial. That was your choice. And it seems to me what counsel chose was to insist, all along, I want my right to two -- to two counsel. You didn't have to --",
  "-- you didn't have to take that right. You could have gone to the -- to the supreme court and said -- you know, since it's taking so long, I demand my constitutional right to a speedy trial. But you didn't do that.",
  "Of course, a finding by the district court -- or whichever court found it, that there was not enough money to pay counsel, to investigate, and to -- to do whatever else -- buy stamps -- is not a finding by the district court that there was not enough money to investigate and to buy stamps. Counsel was a part of that mix. You never had a finding that there was not enough money to pay counsel, right? Or -- I'm sorry -- that there was not enough money to allow the counsel that has been appointed to investigate and buy stamps. Was there ever any such finding?",
  "The -- the big tag item was -- was paying counsel; wasn't it?",
  "I don't think it's enough that none of the delay was attributable to the defense. The defense has to complain, has to demand its right to a prompt trial. What did your client do? Frankly, I -- I am skeptical that a capital defendant who has already confessed to the crime wants to be tried as soon as possible. I'm skeptical about that. Now, what -- what did your client do to demand his right to a prompt trial?",
  "Right.",
  "Well, that's -- surely, that's unconstitutional. Did counsel say, I demand a speedy trial? You can't condition my right to a speedy trial upon my getting some affidavit or something.",
  "I'm still waiting for -- for anybody telling the court, I demand a speedy trial, and, if I don't get a speedy trial, you are violating the Constitution, and I ought to go scot-free.",
  "Not -- not quite. I mean, the question presented is not as general as that. It's much more fact-bound. It says whether a State's failure to fund counsel for an indigent for five years, particularly where failure was the direct result of the prosecution's choice to seek the death penalty, should be weighed against the State for speedy trial purposes. I think this is inviting us to look into the facts of this case and decide whether this five-year delay, particularly since the prosecution chose the death penalty -- you know, I don't like having to do that and -- but it seems, to me, that's what the question presented at least requires.",
  "The Constitution requires such a motion. I mean, I don't care whether they have a -- you know, a speedy trial motion. If -- if denying him the right to speedy trial violates the Constitution, surely, he is entitled to bring that to the attention of the Louisiana court, whether there's a specific statutory or rule provision or not.",
  "Now, they -- they don't even want counsel to say -- you know, Your Honor, we've been trying to get funding, and we're -- we're just sick and tired of waiting for this. We demand a speedy trial, and, if we don't get funding and, therefore, don't get a speedy trial, we think there's a constitutional violation, and we're going to ask that the indictment be dismissed.",
  "Nobody ever made a statement like that to the Court, did they?",
  "What did you say?",
  "Dismissing it, instead of withdrawing it, that's the fine line he's drawing?",
  "Is that a line in Louisiana law? I don't know. Does this -- this come from French law or something? It seems, to me, withdrawing and dismissing sound, to me, the same thing.",
  "Withdrawing his motion to quash. So it was withdrawn, right?",
  "I -- I was going to ask you that question. Opposing counsel said that it -- it wasn't primarily attorney's fees that's at issue here, but investigation costs. That makes a difference to me because, if it's just attorney's fees, he could have gone ahead with one attorney, as far as I'm concerned.",
  "I thought -- I thought the statement meant could not ethically or legally bring him to trial while he is insisting on his right to two counsel.",
  "It would have been different if he had said, the devil with the second counsel, I want a -- I want a prompt trial.",
  "Then you would have felt that, legally and ethically, you could proceed.",
  "His -- his one counsel might have known.",
  "He did have one counsel. He had one counsel because he only graduated from the eighth grade. That's why we provide counsel. And that counsel could have known, no?",
  "She was a graduate of Yale law school; wasn't she?",
  "And another of his counsel, Mr. Singer -- of the three that he had -- he was a graduate of Harvard law school; wasn't he?",
  "Son of a gun.",
  "Mr. Bourke, would you respond to the last point made by -- by opposing counsel?",
  "You did state -- it's in Appendix J -- \"Even if the murder indictment were quashed, Mr. Boyer faces the armed robbery prosecution.\"",
  "You told us, today, that that's not the case, that the armed robbery prosecution goes down the drain. Which -- which is true?",
  "Or assume that there isn't, right?",
  "But why -- why would Congress want to treat them differently?",
  "But why -- why did they feel the need here to assure adequate remedies for tort victims, where they did not in -- in the Westfall Act?",
  "I mean -- you know, injured tort victims are injured tort victims. It does seem -- you know, rather odd that, in -- in one instance, Congress would be concerned and, the other, not concerned.",
  "Of course, when the government removes the case, it concedes that point, doesn't it, normally? Where a case is removed from State court, the government -- the Attorney General must certify that it was within the scope of employment, no?",
  "What was that case, where no action against the United States is available?",
  "Not -- not by reason of the -- of the battery?",
  "I understand.",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "I see.",
  "I got you.",
  "It -- it --",
  "It's right on the same thing, so I -- that provision ends -- and I am strengthening you -- your last point -- that provision ends, \"if the circumstances are such as are likely to preclude the remedies of third persons against the United States described in Section 1346(b) of Title 28.\" That clearly envisions that, in the ordinary case, those remedies against the United States would not be precluded.",
  "But it didn't -- it didn't want to say it shall not apply for everything. It didn't want to eliminate the intentional tort exception for everybody, right? It only wanted to eliminate it for the people covered by -- by the Gonzalez Act.",
  "It might have said that, but, if it wanted to be more parsimonious in its language, it could simply say for purposes of this section.",
  "Which section applies only to these particular individuals.",
  "It was a -- it was a different Congress. They don't always use the same language. Come on.",
  "You're -- you're lucky they even remember the earlier statutes.",
  "Well, listen, I -- you know, I don't -- I don't much care about legislative history, but -- but, if I did --",
  "-- I wouldn't think that -- that you would say it is patterned after another Act, where you change a very basic provision, whether suit can be brought against the United States or not.",
  "I mean, that's sort of rudimentary and fundamental to it. It doesn't seem to me they would say it's patterned after it. But -- you know, I -- I don't care.",
  "Thank you. Thank you, dear colleague. I appreciate that.",
  "I don't think those are the key words. I think the key words are \"shall not apply.\" \"Shall not apply.\"",
  "It isn't shall be deemed inapplicable.",
  "It is not a hypothetical. It says, \"They shall not apply to any cause of action,\" etc.",
  "Why -- why else was it there? Just for fun?",
  "It was obviously there to support your position. Now, your position would have been the same. Now, that's true. Your position would have been identical, but the only purpose of that argument was to support that position.",
  "I don't find that inconsistent with the position argued. There -- you are talking about the statement that the sole purpose was -- was to --",
  "I don't think it is the sole purpose, even if you -- you accept your friend's interpretation.",
  "No, no. The sole purpose is to assure immunity to these doctors. Now, in assuring immunity to these doctors, we -- we are not going to leave these people without any remedy, and so we allowed them a remedy against the United States. That's subsidiary to the sole purpose of the Act. Sure, the sole purpose is to -- is to -- is to help these doctors. But, in order to do it and be fair at the same time, you have to allow suit against the United States. I think you could still say the sole purpose was to help the doctors.",
  "Mr. Shah, can I ask you why -- if your interpretation is correct, Subsection (e) did not read -- not for purposes of this section, but rather for purposes of Subsection (a), the provisions of 2680(h) shall not apply?",
  "For what? For what? You wouldn't -- you wouldn't know what property was taken.",
  "You are -- you are posing a situation in which he never came forward with any suggestion. They never came forward with any suggestion. You say he still has a cause of action for a taking?",
  "A taking of what?",
  "I think the other side says that you may have such a cause of action here.",
  "Wouldn't -- wouldn't the other side in this case acknowledge that you have such a cause -- that you may have such a cause of action here?",
  "But they are just saying you don't have a cause of action for a taking.",
  "Yes, that's fine. That -- that would enable you to challenge the denial of the permit, saying it's based upon an unconstitutional condition. But how does it -- how does it enable you to say there's been a taking? What has been taken?",
  "It hasn't -- it hasn't been taken. I mean, he turned it down.",
  "The -- the permit was granted in Nollan and Dolan. And -- and the condition attached to the permit, therefore, took effect; namely, that you had to dedicate this easement over your -- over your beach, whereas, as my colleague pointed out, anybody could walk back and forth, barefooted.",
  "Sliced bread's supposed to be good.",
  "No, it -- it would be subject to Nollan and Dolan analysis if they took the $10,000. If they issued the permit, the developer went ahead with the development, and the State then attached the -- the bank account in the amount of $10,000 or whatever, that would be Nollan -- in Nollan and Dolan - - in Nollan, there was a taking. He had gone ahead with the -- with the development of his house under the permit, which said, if he did that, he gave away the easement. So there -- there was a -- a taking there. The -- the easement would have been taken automatically. In -- in -- in Dolan, there was -- the individual had not gone ahead with the development, but it was clear that any development the person undertook would be subject to the -- the exaction that the municipality required. So there was a -- a taking there, we said. Here, there's nothing that happens. The permit was denied, unlike in -- unlike in -- in Dolan, where the permit was granted, and it was understood that, if she went ahead with it, she was going to lose -- lose some land rights. Here, the permit's been denied. I can't see where there's a taking here. Nothing's been taken.",
  "The permit had issued. The permit had issued in both of those cases, and, therefore, the person was saying, to go ahead with this permit, I give up -- I give up this land.",
  "There was no approval with conditions. There's one thing for -- for a municipality to issue an -- an approval with conditions, and a municipality saying, we can't approval it unless you agree to these conditions. And the person doesn't agree, and the municipality says, we don't approve it.",
  "Well, it doesn't raise Penn Central. You keep on running away from it by saying Penn Central or Lucas.",
  "It does not deprive the land of all value. The land still has some value. Penn Central is totally out of the case.",
  "As I understand your position, cash is magical, right? The -- the government can come in and -- come into my house, take all of the cash that's there, and that is not the basis for a takings claim, right? Because cash is not -- is not a taking. Does that make any sense?",
  "Right.",
  "The stopping point is don't take my cash.",
  "Your -- your answer to my question is, that's okay, it's not a taking, right?",
  "I may have some other cause of action, but not a -- not a taking? The government's come in and taken my money.",
  "I'm not talking Nollan and Dolan. I'm talking about your position that the taking of cash cannot be a taking.",
  "Oh, I see, I see.",
  "If they -- if they say, you have to turn over to us whatever money you have in your house, or you have to turn over to us whatever's in your bank account, that's not a taking.",
  "What if they do it to five or six other landowners, okay?",
  "Really? Gee, that doesn't strike me as -- as entirely true.",
  "You mean a tax that is imposed only on landowners, and it's -- you know, it's a tax -- $5,000 per landowner, if that were replaced by a provision that said, every -- every landowner shall contribute to the State a portion of his property worth $5,000, that --",
  "The latter is bad, and the former's okay?",
  "That surprises me.",
  "Justification is the protection of wetlands. That's a justification, the protection of wetlands. There's no necessary comparison, as Nollan and Dolan requires, between the harm that would be occasioned if the permit were granted and what the State is exacting in order to mitigate. That -- that doesn't exist anywhere in -- in the analysis that you are talking about.",
  "Now, that is a problem.",
  "What was taken in Nollan and Dolan?",
  "In Nollan, was it the easement that was taken?",
  "Well, but it -- wasn't what was taken unreasonably the ability of this homeowner to make the alterations to his house that he wanted to make? He wanted to add another story and the court -- and the State said, you can't do it. And its only basis for saying, you can't do it was because you wouldn't give us the easement.",
  "Isn't this unreal? I mean, you are saying, all along, in the negotiations, the agency says, if you do X, you get the permit. And X is -- would -- would be an unconstitutional condition. Okay. He refuses to do X. The permit is denied with a general statement like this: The permit is denied because he has refused to do the -- the necessary mitigation. Isn't it clear that the reason he's refused to do the necessary mitigation, is he has refused the last demand of the agency?",
  "Ms. Webre, is there any binding effect of a Federal determination here on State law? And is there any binding effect of any State determination here on Federal law?",
  "If it was left to the State, would what the States say about -- about patent law be binding in any Federal cases? And, vice-versa, if it went to the Federal jurisdiction, would anything that the Federal court says about -- about State tort law be binding on State courts?",
  "Well, that -- that being so, your -- your last argument about the Federal government messing up -- you know, State tort law in an area that -- that is currently very much in the fore in the -- in the decisions of the Texas Supreme Court, that doesn't really carry a lot of weight, except in this single case. I mean, they are not going to mess up Texas law in that regard. They may get this case wrong, but --",
  "What about the Federal issue? Doesn't that need resolving?",
  "Why -- why do all -- why do all of these issues cut in your favor, in all cases involving malpractice? I mean, you're urging, not just that your client win here, but you want us to adopt a general rule that malpractice suits involving patent rights can never, ever come under \"Federal arising\" under jurisdiction. Isn't that -- isn't that what you want us to say?",
  "So the burden would be on you to show that every one of these factors, in all of those cases, is always going to cut in your favor. That -- what, that they will never involve a constitutional issue? That they will never, ever determine future patent decisions?",
  "Well, I like -- I like bright-line rules. In fact -- you know, I thought Holmes had it right. It doesn't arise under, unless the cause of action is a Federal cause of action. But once we've gone down -- down the road of Grable, I don't -- you're -- you're proving a negative. The burden is on you to prove a negative, that there is no situation that can arise in -- in malpractice cases involving patents where the Federal issue would justify arising under jurisdiction. That's a hard road to hoe.",
  "I guess you might argue that, even if it fails the Grable test in a couple of isolated cases, we should still adopt that rule because the benefits of having a -- a clear rule that doesn't have to be litigated in every -- every case outweigh the fact that one or two might -- might not come out that way if we applied Grable.",
  "Because we're making it up anyway, right?",
  "Excuse me. I guess I just don't understand this. Is it the case that there is \"arising under\" jurisdiction only when the Federal cause of action presented is one over which Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction?",
  "Is that -- is that the rule?",
  "I mean, any -- any Federal statute that can be sued upon, both in Federal courts and in State courts, but as to which Federal courts are the dispositive adjudicators, you say that that does not come within this \"arising under\" rule?",
  "Do you have a case for that, that says, if a suit could be brought in State court, even though it involves a dispositive Federal question as to which this Court would be the -- you know, the last interpreter, it cannot possibly come within \"arising under\" jurisdiction? Have you got a case for that.",
  "Do you have a case which says that, when a Federal question is presented in a case over which Federal courts have jurisdiction, but also State courts have jurisdiction, although, needless to say, the Federal courts would be dispositive on the issue, such a case cannot come within the \"arising under\" jurisdiction?",
  "I would find it extraordinary for -- for that to be the rule.",
  "I mean, is that -- my goodness, but you are going to have a purely hypothetical State decision here. The State will have held that -- you know, if -- if he had said this, the result would have been something else. And you think that that precludes the -- the issue when it arises in real life? And you say, since the State court made that hypothetical determination, it precludes me from arguing it in -- in real life.",
  "Do you have any cases like that? It seems, to me, a rather weird -- weird situation. I mean, maybe it could, but it -- it's strange.",
  "They knew -- they knew these were controverted issues. You say that they -- they are controverted issues. So they would have been alerted to a problem anyway. And they certainly would not accept a State court determination as authoritative resolution of that problem.",
  "The patent attorneys. I mean, you --",
  "Excuse me. The State courts are not bound by the Federal court's holding? You mean State courts can resolve patent questions, contrary to what the Supreme Court of the United States says the law is?",
  "Why is that worse than the fact that, if it goes to Federal court, all of the lawyers in the State, in all malpractice cases, are going to be, supposedly, bound by the Federal court's holding as to State issues of malpractice? I mean, it seems to me it's Twiddle Dum or Twiddle Dee, whichever court system you go to, you are going to terrorize the lawyers of that State on the basis of an opinion of a court that is not dispositive on those issues. So I don't -- I don't know why --",
  "And you -- you are trying the malpractice lawsuit -- the State malpractice lawsuit, in Federal court.",
  "So you are talking about a case that has a patent issue, whether it's a contract case, a tort case, a malpractice case -- if it has a patent issue, you think it has to go to Federal court?",
  "Well, then I repeat Justice Ginsburg's question, how do you decide which of those do and which of those don't?",
  "Well, my -- my experience is that Federal judges, including this Federal judge, are not interested in -- in getting into the weeds of patent law, and, if -- if they could rely on a decision of the Federal circuit, they would do that just as fast as they can.",
  "Ms. Webre, can I ask you about the question presented? The way you presented it to us, it -- it was as though we're -- we're reviewing whether the Federal circuit was right to reject Grable in -- in whatever the names of those opinions are. But. In fact, that's not the situation at all. The Texas Supreme Court here applied Grable, and I think just the way you would want it applied. So your -- your contention is simply they didn't apply it correctly; isn't that right?",
  "Well, don't, because I don't -- I don't think it's so clear.",
  "Look, what you've told us is jurisdiction means a lot of things, but what you mean by it is real jurisdiction, right?",
  "Chevron Step Zero jurisdiction. That doesn't clarify things very much for me. What if -- what if the statute in this case said, the FCC shall have no jurisdiction to establish time limits within which the States must act?",
  "Okay? Would that be a jurisdictional question?",
  "Okay. What if the statute just said, the FCC shall not establish time limits within which the States must act. Is that jurisdictional?",
  "I -- I don't think so. In fact, I think we have said in -- in a number of opinions -- and, certainly, I have said in a concurrence -- that the jurisdictional question, like any other question -- an alleged jurisdictional question, like any other one, is to be decided with deference to the agency. Now, if you -- if you talk -- if you want to limit your proposal --",
  "-- to the -- to the entry question --",
  "-- of whether the FCC has jurisdiction to administer the Federal Communications Act, I agree with you. I will decide that without listening to the FCC. But that's -- that's a good deal short of whether, given that it does have jurisdiction to administer the Federal Communications Act, its implementation of this particular provision goes beyond what its authority is. That seems, to me, a question of -- you can call everything that's ultra vires in excess of the agency's jurisdiction, you can. But that's not -- that's not what we mean by the entry jurisdictional question, does the agency have authority to administer this Act.",
  "That's -- that's no different from our holding in any case that the agency has no authority to issue this rule. It has rule-making authority, but this rule goes too far, which is to say Congress did not give the agency authority to go this far.",
  "It's -- it's always a question of how much authority Congress gave the agency.",
  "Did -- did it say, in all of those cases, we give no deference to the agency's contrary determination because this is a jurisdictional question? Did it say anything like that?",
  "I didn't think so.",
  "Very -- very often, I could decide a case -- you know, the lower courts are running away from the question of deference vel non because things have been so confused by Meade. So they simply decide the question assuming no deference to the agency. That doesn't prove that, in that particular case, the agency wouldn't have been entitled to deference.",
  "Whether it was or not, it would have come out this way. So those three cases don't -- don't prove what you say they prove.",
  "Before you get to that, I'm really surprised at your response to Justice Kennedy, that you agree that, even where the agency has no jurisdiction, although you won't give Chevron deference, you will give whatever the other kind of deference.",
  "Why would you give Skidmore deference, if some non-jurisdictional agency comes in and says, hey, by the way, court -- you know, I think this is the right answer? Oh, we will listen to that respectfully. We won't necessarily give you Chevron -- why would you give it any deference at all, if there is no jurisdiction?",
  "And that's all you think that Skidmore deference means? You will listen to opinions that make sense, right?",
  "But just to agency opinions, it makes sense, not to --",
  "Suppose I didn't know that, and I'm just looking at the text, okay?",
  "There are innumerable statutes which, after giving of the agency rule-making authority, provide judicial -- you know, review under this statute shall be held in such-and-such a court. There is no conflict whatever between a statement that any person affected can sue in Federal court and the possession by an agency of rule-making authority. The -- the two simply don't conflict.",
  "That -- that's no better. Louis Jaffe isn't even a member of the Court.",
  "Justice Breyer would replace that with a rule, where they like the agency to have authority, it has it, and, where they don't like it to have authority, it doesn't. I'm not sure that's any better than --",
  "-- a description of the Chevron --",
  "I don't understand the question, to tell you the truth. This matter is not left with the States. It's going to be decided by a Federal instrumentality, right? Either by the agency, which says, 30 days is the rule, or by Federal courts, which perhaps could issue opinions that say, 30 days is the rule. I mean, this -- you know, it's an interesting separation of powers question within the Federal government, but I don't see how it's a question of whether it's the States or the Federal government that's -- that's going to call the tune here. It's going to be the Federal government, isn't it?",
  "Don't -- don't you think that the --",
  "Don't you -- don't you think that the issue of whether unelected Federal bureaucrats should decide it or unelected Federal judges should decide it is an issue of separation of powers, rather than an issue of -- of Federal/State relations?",
  "Well, I -- I thought \"reasonable\" was what people were talking about as being ambiguous, although I think -- I don't think \"ambiguous\" is the proper word. \"Reasonable\" is vague. You don't know exactly what it means, right?",
  "Mr. Verrilli, why isn't it an easy answer to the whole case to read (7)(A), except as provided in this paragraph, nothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority of State or local government? Okay? \"Except as provided in this paragraph.\" And then later, in the paragraph, in the subsection entitled, \"limitations,\" it says, \"A State or local government shall act on any request for authorization within a reasonable period of time.\"",
  "That's -- that's a limitation.",
  "That doesn't prove that they're officers. I mean, that's -- that's not the test for an officer, how much you're paid. The test is whether you exercise significant authority under the laws of the United States. That's a pretty fuzzy line, but I'm not sure that a prison guard exercises significant authority under the laws of the United States.",
  "Well, I will give you -- I'll give you a textual basis. Why is it if all the statute is concerned about is the status of being a law enforcement -- investigative or law enforcement officer -- why is it that the exception it makes does not eliminate the exemption for libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit or interference with contract rights? There is excepted from the provisions of the Tort Claims Act any claim arising out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abusive process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit or interference with contract rights. However, for -- for purposes of this exemption from the exemption -- the exception from the exemption, they leave out the latter part. Why did they only put in the others? I think the reason they only put in the others is that those are the kind of torts that would be conducted in the course of conducting a -­ what's the words -- investigative or law enforcement activity.",
  "The others would not -- would not occur.",
  "Yes, but it's -- it's a limiting factor that -- that shows, that displays an intent to limit the -- the activities of investigative or law enforcement officers to those activities conducted in the course of investigating or enforcing the law.",
  "Why would it leave out those other ones? That's what I'm asking you. What possible reason is there to leave out libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights?",
  "I -- I didn't deny that it's the judgment. What reason could there be for that judgment?",
  "I give you a reason.",
  "The reason -- the reason they left it out is that they don't think those torts would be committed in the course of investigating or enforcing the law.",
  "Mr. Yang, the United States didn't take this position below, right?",
  "This is a change of heart. How long ago was it that the United States took the opposite position, the position argued by amicus here?",
  "So it couldn't be that obvious, I guess?",
  "Can you suggest why Congress might have left out libel, slander, misrepresentation?",
  "Why -- why would they leave that out if they are only looking at the office and not at the function that the person is performing?",
  "Right. I mean, that's the point. So what you are saying is that it suggests that they mean Federal law enforcement officers engaged in law enforcement.",
  "Well, you don't think the EPA is engaged in law enforcement when it enforces statutes and regulations, do you?",
  "Would an officer of the EPA be a law enforcement officer when he writes a letter to a company saying, you know, you are violating section such-and-such of the statute? Is that a law enforcement officer?",
  "You are saying that the Government is trying to minimize the consequences of coming out its way by providing a definition of the officers covered, which will not hold. You think it does cover a broader category of officers including OSHA inspectors, but it does not cover them when they are not engaged in law enforcement activities.",
  "You -- you support the government's position on who's an officer, right? So it wouldn't include EPA. Is that --",
  "Is that a yes or a no?",
  "I didn't understand that last sentence. Any farmer who plants and grows soybeans is violating the patent?",
  "I thought that their claim is that he only violates the patent if he tries to grow additional seeds from his first crop. Right? Isn't that the only claim here?",
  "No, not that seed. It's different seed. That seed is done. It's been planted in the ground and has grown other seed. It's the other seed we are talking about. It's not the very seed that was sold. Right?",
  "I don't understand this. I thought soybeans are seeds.",
  "Including the Monsanto seeds?",
  "Some of them would -- would grow at different rates than others.",
  "But not the original batch that he buys from Monsanto?",
  "The original batch that he buys from Monsanto, in addition to being resistant to the chemical that kills the weeds, in addition to that, they all mature at the same rate.",
  "So all the Monsanto seeds are not -- are not fungible.",
  "There are some of them that mature early, some mature late.",
  "That's a pretty horrible result, but let me give you another horrible result, and that is if -- if we agree with you, farmers will not be able to do a second planting by simply getting the undifferentiated seeds from -- from a grain elevator because at least a few of those seeds will always be patented seeds, and no farmer could ever plant anything from a grain elevator, which means -- I gather they use it for second plantings where the risks are so high that it doesn't pay to buy expensive seed. Now they can't do that anymore because there's practically no grain elevator that doesn't have at least one patented seed in it.",
  "That's why it's so cheap. And that's why farmers --",
  "-- and that's why farmers want to use it, for a cheap planting.",
  "Sure, sure, I understand.",
  "What do you mean you can do it once? I don't know what you --",
  "One shot of a gun.",
  "You can't rob a bank with it, though, right?",
  "Do you agree that it's unlawful for grain elevators to sell it for replanting?",
  "Yes, but -- but that's -- nothing prevents him from planting it. What he is prevented from doing is using the -- the consequences of that planting, the second generation seeds, for another planting. That's all he is prevented from doing. He can plant and harvest and eat or sell. He just can't plant, harvest, and then replant.",
  "You know, you're saying that you are preventing him from using it. He's not prevented from using it. He can use it for what it's meant for, for raising a crop. He just cannot use the product -- that new crop -- for replanting. That's all. He has to sell that new crop for feed or for some other purpose. But to say that -- that he's prevented from using what he has bought is simply not true. He can use it, plant it, and harvest the crop.",
  "When -- when was the first of those laws enacted? Do you know? I think it's -- I think it's in my adult lifetime that Florida was the first to enact a sunshine law. Is that -- am I correct about that?",
  "In the '60s.",
  "And you say that's a fundamental -- that's a fundamental right covered by Privileges and Immunities Clause, which nobody had until the 1960s?",
  "But those -- those rights still exist in this State, don't they? Cannot you get records of deeds and whatever the common law would have covered?",
  "Well, I'll ask them -- I didn't understand that to be their position, but -- but",
  "Mr. Gupta, I -- I understand that the -- the reasoning of Virginia in not allowing out-of-State people to -- to get these FOIA requests is the following: That the purpose of these -­ these laws -- and I remember it when the first ones were enacted -- government in the sunshine. The purpose of it was not to enable people to get information, per se; it was to enable people to see how their government is working, so that they could attend to any malfeasance that is occurring in the process of government. It seems to me entirely in accord with that purpose of these laws to say it's only Virginia citizens who -- who are concerned about the functioning of Virginia government and ought to be able to get whatever records Virginia agencies have. What's -- what's wrong with that reasoning?",
  "But -- but you don't need any personal or property interest under these laws. You can just -- just out of curiosity, if you -- if you were a Virginian, at least, in Virginia, even though you have no interest in the matter at all, you can ask the agency for records about this or that. It -- it can't be based on -- on the traditional property interest. It's based on the ability of the citizens of the State to find out what the -- what the government of the State is up to.",
  "But that -- that just goes to the extent of the impact, not -- not on the principle. And you say extent doesn't matter. You say there's no such thing as a de minimis exception.",
  "So that -- that explanation doesn't -- doesn't seem, to me, to hold water.",
  "So what? So what? Except to the extent that that bears upon how much of a -- an imposition this is upon interstate commerce. It seems, to me, that's the only relevance of that point.",
  "And -- and you dismiss that relevance. You say it doesn't matter how extensive the impact is on -- on interstate commerce.",
  "It's just Virginia media, though, isn't it? Isn't it only media that -­",
  "-- exists or is broadcast into Virginia?",
  "Well, that's consistent with their purpose, that this statute is meant to assure good, honest government in Virginia.",
  "But they -- but they just don't want out -- they -- they don't want outlanders mucking around in -- in Virginia government. It's perfectly okay for good old Virginians to do that, but they don't want outlanders to do it. Why -- why is that",
  "But the Virginia citizens",
  "And the out-of-Staters don't pay for the database.",
  "And, besides, do -- do you -- is it the law that -- that the State of Virginia cannot do anything that's pointless? Only -- only the Federal Government can do stuff that's pointless?",
  "Or even for commercial purposes. Don't you think if -- if those who created these government in the sunshine laws could have drafted them in such a way that inquiries for commercial purposes would not be allowed, but only those inquiries that are intended to look into the workings of State government and produce government in the sunshine, don't you think that they probably would have excluded commercial inquiries, if they could? But you can't tell which ones are commercial and which aren't.",
  "You are saying that it's no more necessary for you to show that there's no commercial value to allowing out-of-Staters to do this than it is necessary for you to show that there is no commercial value to your not allowing out-of-Staters to hunt deer in Virginia.",
  "You say that it's up to Virginia -­",
  "-- whether -- whether out-of-Staters can hunt for Virginia game.",
  "And it's up to Virginia whether out-of-Staters can have access to the State's records, that they have no interest in, personally, under -- under this law. It seems, to me, perfectly logical.",
  "I didn't understand -- if that's your argument on it, I reject it as Justice Kennedy does. I -- I didn't understand you to be arguing that there is no commercial value.",
  "Yes, that's what I thought.",
  "You -- you can't say discriminatory regulation. What about a tax? I mean, you can't tax discriminatorily, and I wouldn't call taxation, in and of itself, a regulation of commerce, would you?",
  "Well, even though it's -­ even though it's not a regulation of commerce?",
  "Okay. I mean, I guess that's your argument, then.",
  "We are talking about",
  "There is not much that's as close to the sovereignty of the State as the possession and right to exclude people from its own records and its own documents, right?",
  "So the -- the issue is can the State allow its own citizens, for purposes of seeing that the government is -- is being run on the up-and-up, have access to those documents, without letting the whole world?",
  "Excuse me. The -- I -- I think what he's saying is you don't have to pay the costs of developing and maintaining those records, which costs are paid by the citizens of Virginia, which gives them an additional interest in being able to get to those documents. You -- you don't claim that -- that you pay for the development and the maintenance of those records. You just pay for the incremental costs of giving it to you, right?",
  "And Virginians pay for all the rest?",
  "Excuse me. Why -- why didn't -- why weren't they subject to a favorable regulatory regime in two, three, and four?",
  "That -- that's a way of estimating future value. I -- I don't know that anybody values a company that -- that is sold on the market by saying how much money did they make in the last 2 years, and we are going to multiply that by 9. You look at what people were paying you in the market.",
  "There's clearly no Martinez protection. The question you are being asked, I think, boils down to whether we should develop a new case, Martinez plus, in which -- even though there is, technically, the ability to raise it, which is all that Martinez spoke about, the mere fact that the ability to raise it is not effective enough should produce the same result that Martinez produced. I don't think there is any -- I'm not even sure the other side claims that Martinez said what -- what he is arguing here.",
  "It was the nose of the camel, which is what Martinez was -- which is what the dissent said, actually.",
  "Where -- where is that in the text? What are you relying on in the text of 2244?",
  "You -- you don't have 2244(b)in your brief, do you?",
  "That is very -- that is unfortunate.",
  "If you're relying on it, I mean.",
  "Well, that's really good. I'll bet you, if you conducted a lot of unreasonable searches and seizures, you'd get more convictions, too.",
  "That proves absolutely nothing.",
  "So that's its purpose, to enable you to identify future criminals -- the perpetrators of future crimes? That's the purpose of it? I thought that that wasn't the purpose set forth in the -- in the statute.",
  "I know.",
  "Yes, but our -- our search incident to arrest cases don't allow that. That's sort of the point. They -- they allow you to search for firearms, they allow you to search for material that relates to the crime for which the person has been arrested. But you can't search the person for other stuff.",
  "Well, wait. Evidence relating to matters other than the crime of arrest?",
  "Mr. Shanmugam, I -- I wouldn't have made the concession that you've made, that this case is about reasonable expectation of privacy. If there's no reasonable expectation of privacy, there's no search. But, here, there is a search. You have a physical intrusion. You -- you pull a guy's cheek apart and stick a -- a swab into his mouth. That's a search, reasonable expectation of privacy or not.",
  "Well, I thought you did.",
  "He gave us one and two. I have been waiting for three. Will you drop the shoe?",
  "Yes, but, if we believe that the purpose of it has much to do with whether it's legitimate or not, you can't demonstrate that the -- that the purpose is immediate identification of the people coming into custody, you just can't demonstrate that now. Maybe you can in 2 years. The purpose now is -- is the purpose you began your presentation with, to catch the bad guys, which is a good thing. But -- you know, the Fourth Amendment sometimes stands in the way.",
  "Excuse me. A mandatory schedule?",
  "A mandatory schedule, you say?",
  "Oh, okay.",
  "It's not a change of the law if -- if the law does not require the guidelines to be imposed. Your -- your case rests upon the proposition you stated at the outset, which is that the Ex Post Facto Law applies -- prohibition applies -- if there is a substantial possibility of -- of a higher sentence -- was that the language you used?",
  "Significant risk. Suppose -- suppose the district judge for the Federal district in which somebody's crime was committed was a bleeding heart judge. He always gave the lowest sentence possible, and everybody knew that. And he is replaced. He retires after the arrest, after the crime, and he is replaced by Maximum John, who everybody knows gives the highest sentence, every time. Ex post -- ex post facto violation?",
  "What about the statutes allowing relatives and friends of the victim to testify? Let's assume a crime committed before -- a horrible crime committed before that statute is enacted. Does it violate the ex post facto law to give effect to that statute?",
  "Why? Don't -- don't you think it creates a significant risk --",
  "-- that the defendant will get a higher sentence? Don't you think that's the whole object of the law, in fact?",
  "Is that -- is that what -- who says that they're the benchmark that you start with? Where -- where is that writ?",
  "A court -- a court must begin with that?",
  "Your -- your case depends, it seems to me, upon the proposition that significant risk is only applicable at the sentencing stage. And I'm not sure that that's true. I mean, what -- why -- why would that be so? What if -- what if you have a new law that permits evidence to come in, in a criminal trial, that previously was not allowed to come in? Let's say the testimony of a wife or -- or whatever. I think the law is pretty well established that that change in procedure does not violate the ex post facto law. And -- and your response to that is, well, that's not sentencing; it's trial. So what? I mean, if -- certainly making a conviction more likely is -- is even worse than making a higher sentence more likely.",
  "But saying that the sentencer has to consider testimony from the victim or from relatives of the deceased, that -- that change in sentencing law is okay?",
  "It pertains to sentencing. It -- it says what the sentencing authority, the judge or the jury, must consider.",
  "This is evidence brought before the sentencer.",
  "I don't see any difference between that and saying that the -- the guidelines have to be considered by the sentencer.",
  "Does it \"affix a higher punishment,\" in the words of Calder v. Bull?",
  "I don't think that's a question at all. The answer to that is quite easy. It does not affix a higher punishment, does it?",
  "Okay. Then rely on Garner, but not on Calder v. Bull.",
  "That doesn't help --",
  "I disagree with all that, by the way.",
  "I assume that the statute is one that permits 10 days, right?",
  "It's sort of an unusual statute, but, if the hypothetical is in the real world, the statute provides -- you know, 10 days to life, okay? And the judge thinks 10 days is okay. I think that's the hypothetical.",
  "I think you are saying it doesn't matter if they are advisory --",
  "It is reversible error, is it not, simply to blindly apply the guidelines without considering the factors in 3553? That's reversible, isn't it?",
  "Mr. Feigin, I'm under the impression -- more than the impression I know -- that the Sentencing Commission can make a revision of the guidelines retroactive. Can it only do that for revisions that -- that lower the -- the suggested penalty? Or can it do that for revisions that increase it as well?",
  "Only for lower, okay.",
  "Because, if it could increase it, then it would be violating, according to your -- your friend, the Ex Post Facto Clause.",
  "I guess you could have said the same thing under the Sherman Act before Rule 23 existed, right?",
  "Before there was such as thing as class actions.",
  "The same thing would have been true. If, indeed, your claim was so small that you can't claim -- can't pay an expert, you, as a practical matter, don't bring the suit.",
  "I suppose that American Express wouldn't have had to agree to arbitration at all, right? They could have just said -- you know, you -- you have a cause of action, you sue us in court, right? They could say that, legally, couldn't they?",
  "And until Rule 23 was adopted, that would mean -- you know, if you had a small claim, tough luck, right? De minimis non curate lex. If it's just negligible, it's impracticable for you to bring a Federal claim. And that would not violate the Sherman Act, would it?",
  "But they could borrow the money from a lawyer instead of from the trade association, right?",
  "I don't see -- I don't see how a Federal statute is frustrated or is unable to be vindicated if it's too expensive to bring a Federal suit. That happened for years before there was such a thing as class action in Federal courts. Nobody thought the Sherman Act was a dead letter, that it couldn't be vindicated.",
  "And I don't see why it's any different when you transpose the situation to the -- to the arbitration situation.",
  "You -- you -- I don't understand. You think they could have appealed on that -- on that issue?",
  "Let me ask you. Your effective vindicability principle depends upon a comparison with what you could do in Court.",
  "It doesn't?",
  "Yes, but if you couldn't do it -- if you couldn't do it either -- even if there had been no arbitration agreement, how could the arbitration agreement be -- be harming you? I don't understand that.",
  "Or in court.",
  "You have to compare it to court.",
  "If you couldn't do it in court, you don't have to be able to do it in arbitration, it seems to me.",
  "They could write a treatise on it, maybe.",
  "Suppose this class could not -- could not qualify for certification in Federal court. Are you asserting that there is some arbitration principle that -- that allows you to create some new class?",
  "So you have to make -- you have to make a comparison to what can be done in Federal court, don't you?",
  "It isn't. So that any class that the arbitrator thinks is okay is required.",
  "But he wants a class. What he wants in the arbitration is the ability to sue on behalf of a class, doesn't he?",
  "Is -- is that what you asked for below, anything, class action or compensation or whatever?",
  "That's what I thought. That's what I thought this case was about. What's the question presented anyway?",
  "Whether -- whether the Federal Arbitration Act permits courts invoking the Federal substantive law of arbitrability to invalidate arbitration agreements on the ground that they do not permit class arbitration of a Federal law claim. Now, you're saying that -- that whether they permit class arbitration is not going to be decided on the basis of whether you could certify a class under Rule 23, but just what? And -- and -- and if it does depend on that, what is the Court supposed to do? Before it can -- it can give you your claim, it has to -- it has to decide whether this class would be certifiable, wouldn't it? My goodness --",
  "-- this is a very complicated procedure.",
  "You should have said, \"I accept,\" very quickly.",
  "Would that be the case even before Rule 23 was -- was adopted?",
  "Even though you couldn't vindicate it in the Federal courts, you must be able to vindicate it in arbitration?",
  "I'm not even talking about a pure exculpatory clause. I'm talking about the mere fact that as a practical matter, it's impossible to bring it in arbitration. In a context in which it is also impossible to bring it in Federal court. And you would say, still, you must permit it to be brought in arbitration, even though it can't be brought in Federal court.",
  "What -- what are the arbitration fees? It's not -- not -- not lawyers' fees. Do they include lawyers' fees?",
  "Okay. So I don't know, what do you --",
  "So what are you comparing it to in court litigation?",
  "A filing fee?",
  "Excuse me. They didn't get cert granted on that question at all. As I pointed out before, they got it granted on whether the mere fact that the arbitration agreement did not permit class arbitration renders it invalid.",
  "That's what I thought the question before us.",
  "I'd like to hear the answer, if nobody --",
  "I was about to ask a similar question. If someone is acquitted of a Federal crime, would it -- would the prosecution be able to say, well, okay, he didn't commit this crime, but Congress could have enacted a different statute which he would have violated in this case. Of course, you wouldn't listen to that, would you?",
  "Indeed, Congress must have found that the situation was even clearer and the violations even more evident than originally because, originally, the vote in the Senate, for example, was something like 79 to 18, and in the 2006 extension, it was 98 to nothing. It must have been even clearer in 2006 that these States were violating the Constitution. Do you think that's true?",
  "Or decided that perhaps they'd better not vote against it, that there's nothing, that there's no -- none of their interests in voting against it.",
  "I thought -- I thought the same thing. I thought it's sort of extraordinary to say Congress can just pick out, we want to hit these eight States, it doesn't matter what formula we use; so long as we want to hit these eight States, that's good enough and that makes it constitutional. I doubt that that's true.",
  "And it happens not to be the method that Congress selected.",
  "If they selected that, you could say they used a rationale that works. But just because they picked some other rationale, which happens to produce this result, doesn't seem to me very persuasive.",
  "And that will always be true forever into the future. You could always say, oh, there has been improvement, but the only reason there has been improvement are these extraordinary procedures that deny the States sovereign powers, which the Constitution preserves to them. So, since the only reason it's improved is because of these procedures, we must continue those procedures in perpetuity.",
  "Is that the argument you are making?",
  "I thought that was the argument you were just making.",
  "That's a different argument.",
  "Hundreds? Hundreds? Dozens? What?",
  "Right.",
  "Well, maybe it was making that judgment, Mr. Verrilli. But that's -- that's a problem that I have. This Court doesn't like to get involved in -- in racial questions such as this one. It's something that can be left -- left to Congress. The problem here, however, is suggested by the comment I made earlier, that the initial enactment of this legislation in a -- in a time when the need for it was so much more abundantly clear was -- in the Senate, there -- it was double-digits against it. And that was only a 5-year term. Then, it is reenacted 5 years later, again for a 5-year term. Double-digits against it in the Senate. Then it was reenacted for 7 years. Single digits against it. Then enacted for 25 years, 8 Senate votes against it. And this last enactment, not a single vote in the Senate against it. And the House is pretty much the same. Now, I don't think that's attributable to the fact that it is so much clearer now that we need this. I think it is attributable, very likely attributable, to a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement. It's been written about. Whenever a society adopts racial entitlements, it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes. I don't think there is anything to be gained by any Senator to vote against continuation of this act. And I am fairly confident it will be reenacted in perpetuity unless -- unless a court can say it does not comport with the Constitution. You have to show, when you are treating different States differently, that there's a good reason for it. That's the -- that's the concern that those of us who -- who have some questions about this statute have. It's -- it's a concern that this is not the kind of a question you can leave to Congress. There are certain districts in the House that are black districts by law just about now. And even the Virginia Senators, they have no interest in voting against this. The State government is not their government, and they are going to lose -- they are going to lose votes if they do not reenact the Voting Rights Act. Even the name of it is wonderful: The Voting Rights Act. Who is going to vote against that in the future?",
  "We looked behind it in Boerne. I'm not talking about dismissing it. I'm -- I'm talking about looking at it to see whether it makes any sense.",
  "But that's true in every State, isn't it?",
  "I mean -- you know, I don't think anybody is contesting that it's more effective if you use Section 5. The issue is why just in these States. That's it.",
  "Do you think all of the noncovered States are worse in that regard than the nine covered States, is that correct?",
  "Every -- every one of them is worse.",
  "It's not just a fair one, it's the crucial question. Congress has selected these nine States. Now, is there some good reason for selecting these nine?",
  "That's a good answer. I was hoping you would say that.",
  "A quarter of a million dollars in loans.",
  "And that did not go back into the trust.",
  "As it should. Doesn't the trustee have to disgorge whatever he makes by improper use of the trust funds?",
  "I don't understand. Where does this reckless act come from? Where do you get reckless act out of either fraud or defalcation?",
  "Perhaps so. Where did they get it from?",
  "Well, the -- why are you giving away that it's not in the traditional sense? I think it's a loss in the traditional sense. The trust was entitled to whatever profit was made from the use of its funds, right?",
  "And he made a quarter million dollars that should have belonged to the trust. It's not enough to say, well -- you know, I'll pay you 2 percent interest or whatever the going rate of interest was. He made $250,000 which should have been given to the trust.",
  "That's not consistent with the original meaning of defalcation to which you were appealing. It's pretty clear to me that the original meaning of -- is a cutting off, a failure to turn over money that was due. So you -- are you appealing the original meaning or not?",
  "You're saying defalcation just means breach of trust. That's it.",
  "And that's what made it a defalcation, no?",
  "Well, so then you say there has to be a cutting off. There has to be a loss, for defalcation. Not just for -- for a debt, but also for the defalcation.",
  "Why are you fighting that? You're going to have to prove the loss anyway. You say there is a loss.",
  "\"Malversation.\"",
  "Well, why not? I mean, it's a -- it's a violation of the trustee's responsibility when he makes a negligent investment of the funds, right? And so he doesn't turn over as much money as should be turned over. It's a defalcation.",
  "So that form should have included the eligibility requirements that your State demands. And it seems to me your complaint is that the Federal form does not require proof of citizenship, unless you consider just the statement that I'm a citizen to be proof of citizenship. But why didn't you challenge the form? I mean, that's -- that's my problem with this. I frankly think that Federal form doesn't make much sense unless it's -- unless it's to be exclusive for Federal voting. And -- and why didn't you challenge the -- the refusal of the Commission to include on the form, as additional State requirements, the proof of citizenship?",
  "Sure. Sure.",
  "Well, you're -- you're simply denying then that the Federal government can, so long as it protects the requirements that your State imposes, you're -- you're saying the Federal government cannot prescribe a single form for -- for voter registration.",
  "Why -- why can't it make it exclusive? Let's assume -- I think -- I think that -- that accept and -- and employ, whatever the language is --",
  "-- suppose -- suppose I think that that does mean that it's supposed to be exclusive. What harm is there so long as the Federal Commission requires, as part of the Federal form, all of the necessary proofs of -- of qualification that the State imposes?",
  "And you did nothing more about that?",
  "You -- you didn't go to court to say you have to include this as one of the State-specific requirements. Why didn't you do that?",
  "Oh. Okay. Why didn't he do it?",
  "How could you establish citizenship without having something mailed in, in addition to the form? What are the other State-specific requirements? You have to put down your driver's license number or some other numbers? I -- I guess you could -- you could make them check off place of birth and if that place of birth is not the United States, you could require them to write down some number of -- of their admission to citizenship. Are there -- are there numbers that you could demand?",
  "Okay.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes, that's the kind of thing you should have had and that your predecessor should have asked for to be included in the Federal form.",
  "Well, I don't think they're driving the bus as to the form. They can't drive it into a ditch. They're -- they're -- they're subject to arbitrary and capricious limitations, just as any other agency is. And to allow Louisiana -- to include what -- what they've allowed a Louisiana to include and to say that the only proof of citizenship -- there is a provision in the statute which says consistent with determining, the States being able to determine the qualifications. Isn't there a provision which makes it clear that the Federal form has to make allowance for the States determining the qualifications?",
  "Now --",
  "That's true.",
  "But the form has to enable the State to do that. And it seems to me you were quite able to argue that in -- in refusing to allow you to include in the -- in the Federal form in Arizona some indication of proof of citizenship requiring nothing else except oh, I'm a -- check off, I am a citizen, right? So it's under oath. Big deal. If -- if -- if you're willing to violate the voting laws, I suppose you're willing to violate the perjury laws.",
  "So I think you should -- you should have challenged the commission's refusal to -- to place that evidence in the Federal form.",
  "Gee, if I believed -- if I believed in legislative history, I would find that very persuasive.",
  "And enclosing your driver's license number is that immense barrier, right?",
  "That's what's keeping 40 percent of eligible voters away?",
  "I still think that's a relatively few number, and -- and if you don't have the driver's license, then you can use your naturalization certificate.",
  "Well, you can say that about any certification procedure that, now and then there will be a mistake. I mean the fact that there is one person where -- where the computer spit out the wrong number or something, that is the basis for rejecting the entire system that Arizona proposes?",
  "Is that conclusive or can that be challenged?",
  "Excuse me, they may require it. It doesn't say they must require it. So it leaves it open to the Commission, does it not, to decline to require some materials that is necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess eligibility? Isn't that -- isn't that what the language means?",
  "May means may.",
  "No, no, no, we're talking about -- right now we are talking about the consequences of that language, not -- and the consequence of the may is may. It does not even require the Commission to include within the form everything that's necessary for the State to determine eligibility. Now, why would Congress ever create such a system where the Commission need not require what's necessary for eligibility, and nonetheless, the State cannot, cannot require anything further than what the Commission says?",
  "It says what you only may require. It doesn't say what you only shall require.",
  "Is all that stuff required by the Vote America Act? All that stuff?",
  "Just the first thing you mentioned for us.",
  "And the rest is -- is what?",
  "Not anything else that they want. Not anything else that they want. But what is, in the words of the statute, necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess the eligibility of the applicant? It's clear that the statute intends the States to be able to do that. And you say, well, the -- you know, the Commission has -- has required its -- its own proof and the State wants a different kind of proof. The proof the Commission requires is simply the statement, I'm a citizen. This is proof?",
  "This is not proof at all.",
  "Under oath is not proof at all. It's just a statement.",
  "Mr. Srinivasan, the problem that I have with that is that the provision you're alluding to says that -- not that the State shall – not that the commission \"shall\" require the information necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess eligibility, but it simply says that it \"may\" require only that information. Now, is it conceivable that Congress intended that the Commission may not require some information that is necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess eligibility, but that the State may not require it either? Is that a conceivable disposition of Congress?",
  "You think \"may require only\" means shall require only? Is that -- is that your submission? \"May require only\" means shall require only?",
  "It would not be a problem if the State could require it. It would not be a problem. When -- when the commission fails to do what -- what enables the State to assess qualifications, the State will do it. No problem.",
  "Yes. And since you believe that \"may require only\" means \"shall require only,\" in judicial review, the determination before the -- the Court would be whether indeed this information is necessary to enable the State to assess the qualifications, right?",
  "And the district court here certainly thought that was necessary. So you're going to be in -- in bad shape -- the government is going to be -- the next time somebody does challenge the Commission determination in court under the Administrative Procedure Act.",
  "You got to stop saying the Commission approved of it. 2-2 is not approving. You could say the Commission was unable to disapprove of it.",
  "I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
  "I would like to hear your answer.",
  "The jury decides all of this, right?",
  "That's wonderful. Twelve -- twelve tried men and few -- and true decide for the whole State what the -- what the cost/benefit analysis is for a -- a very novel drug that unquestionably has some deleterious effects, but also can save some lives. And the jury's going to decide that?",
  "The Feds didn't say to do the opposite. They said -- they didn't say you have to drive in New Hampshire. They say, you must drive on the right if you drive. They don't require you to drive in New Hampshire.",
  "Yes, one of -- one of your -- your argument you were making is that there -- since the attorneys' fees provision looks to the end of the case, it should not be construed to apply to the -- the failure to meet the filing deadline. Is -- is that true? I mean, the statute says if the judgment does not award compensation, on a petition filed under Section 300aa-11 -- if the judgment does -- is there no judgment when a -- when a case is dismissed for failure to meet the statute requirement?",
  "Wait, so --",
  "Other than the judgment. Okay. So then -- then your argument that -- that this fee provision looks to the end of the case simply doesn't fly. It looks to the beginning as well, if indeed dismissal for failure to comply with the time limit is a judgment.",
  "Well --",
  "Okay. That's just repeating your -- your first argument.",
  "That petition means -- means a petition properly filed, but I don't see that the -- that the statutory scheme, the provision that's at issue here, the provision for the award of attorneys' fees looks to the end of the case and not to the beginning. It looks to the judgment. And if it's a judgment that dismisses because of a failure to comply with the statute, it's still a judgment.",
  "That's your first argument. I understand.",
  "Well, wait. Congress has waived sovereign immunity. It's absolutely clear that there's a waiver of sovereign immunity here.",
  "And once we find that, I don't think we nitpick the following language to unrealistically narrow it as much as possible. I mean, the initial question of whether Congress has agreed to be sued is, yes, we -- we assume it hasn't and -- and -- but -- but once it's clear that it has agreed to be sued, I think we just interpret the language reasonable.",
  "Could I -- I have been thinking about your last point. Couldn't that last point easily be remedied by -- by simply our holding that -- you know, you -- you can't ride both horses; that if, in fact, you've litigated it through to a -- to a merits judgment in your favor, which presumably has stare decisis effect, you then cannot come back and say the suit never occurred because the filing was too late. I mean, we -- I think we're able to hold that, don't you think?",
  "I mean, I agree with you it's a terrible -- it's a terrible, outrageous thing for the government to do, to win the case and get -- get stare decisis effect, and then to say you can't get lawyers' fees because there's never been a case, right?",
  "We could make that up, couldn't we?",
  "Sure.",
  "I assume this is one of those difficult merits questions you were alluding to, it doesn't go to whether there's jurisdiction, but to whether the claim of a taking can be asserted by the partnership in question, isn't it?",
  "I don't -- I don't see how it goes to jurisdiction, which is the only question before us.",
  "Well, some of the raisins were their own. Some of the raisins were their own.",
  "At least as to that, that wouldn't be true, right?",
  "Why? Why -- why does it withdraw for the one and not the other?",
  "No, I don't mean the policy. I don't mean the policy reason. What in the law leads you to that conclusion?",
  "What was the first? I forgot the first already. What was the first?",
  "What -- what isn't jurisdictional?",
  "I'm really -- I'm really confused. You are saying there ought to be a remand here because the question is not jurisdictional, which is just what your friend says, right?",
  "So the two of you are in agreement it ought to go back to the Ninth Circuit, they should do it on the merits, and -- and if that's wrong, we can review that.",
  "That may well be, but --",
  "Yes, but part of -- part of that penalty was -- you know, your raisins or your life, right? I mean, it was --",
  "-- you don't have to pay the penalty if you give us the raisins.",
  "You mean they -- Is that right, they have to give the raisins?",
  "Okay. So --",
  "-- that amounts to the same thing, your raisins or the penalty, right?",
  "That couldn't be what the statute meant. I think that's what Justice Breyer says. Did -- did Congress create a statute in which we're going to take your raisins and then you can go to the Court of Claims and get your money back. I mean, that -- that surely is not what Congress contemplated. The -- the whole notion of the program is you can't get your money back in the Court of Claims. Now, if you're raising a constitutional objection, that's something else. That should be done in district court. But to say that Congress contemplated -- you know, we'll take your raisins and then you sue in the Court of Claims, they give you your money back. That's a weird statute.",
  "And you -- you think that's a close question? You think that the way the statute is supposed to operate, once it is held that this is an unconstitutional taking, is that every year, the government takes the raisins and every year, the grower goes to the Court of Claims and gets the money back for the raisins. Is that the program that Congress anticipated?",
  "I don't think it's close at all. That's a crazy statute. Every year we're going to take raisins and every year we're going to pay you in the Court of Claims. What's the purpose of that?",
  "That's -- that's a merits question again. I mean, it's not a question of whether you -- you can resist on the basis of a takings claim. It's a question of whether you are going to win.",
  "A bailee?",
  "Yes, I suppose a bailee could, a bailee of the car.",
  "My question is -- is the same as Justice Breyer's. It seems to me you are running in the wrong direction. To the extent you say the case doesn't involve New Hampshire's towing law but involves just its general consumer protection law, it's -- it's even further distant from being preempted. I --",
  "Suppose -- I understand. My goodness. Suppose a vehicle -- I pay for somebody to tow -- I agree that somebody will tow my vehicle and I will pay him $100. And he tows the vehicle, puts it in my garage and says, give me the $100. And I say, ha, ha, I'm not going to give you $100.",
  "Now, you think that that general obligation under State law to pay a debt that you've contracted to pay is eliminated?",
  "Why is that different from normal consumer protection law? I -- I don't see that it's so much different.",
  "It -- it includes storage, is the point you are coming to, right?",
  "The definition includes storage. You think it means -- it means storage at the end of the transportation? Suppose you're -- you're a company that moves goods, but we also store goods. You can -- you know, rent -- rent space and we will store your furniture for years. If that company picks up some goods, brings it to its warehouse and leaves it in its warehouse for 3 years, that storage is covered by this -- by this statute, you think? See, I thought the storage was -- was storage in the course of the transportation. Sometimes when you're -- you know, changing the mode of transportation, going from trucks to ships or something, you have to store it temporarily during -- during the course of the transportation. That's how I would read it. But you're saying, even if you're a storage company, if you pick up goods and bring it to the place where you store it, that's covered by -- by this statute.",
  "Well, let me tell you how we -- it seems to me we've limited it in -- in the Columbus case, Columbus v. Harrah's Garage and Wrecker Services, Inc. We said that, \"The clause -- the clause's limitation to motor carrier services with respect to the transportation of property massively limits the scope of preemption to include only laws, regulations, and other provisions that single out for special treatment motor carriers of property.\" And here you've told us that this case doesn't involve any law that singles them out for -- for special treatment. To the contrary, it's the general consumer protection law.",
  "So you want us to eat those words, they were wrong, or -- or somehow you don't come within them?",
  "Ah.",
  "I forgot that.",
  "So you say they were wrong, you say?",
  "What about the price of the storage? Are you challenging that?",
  "You've just told us anything that significantly affects the transportation service is covered. And I think what your brother's argument is, is that this significantly affects the service, whether he can collect for the storage after -- you know, after the -- after towing it by -- by selling it, and by selling it on terms that are not so onerous as to impinge upon his -- his ability to run the business.",
  "He's worried that it'll be preempted.",
  "And he didn't -- he didn't mention Cambridge, did he?",
  "I don't think so.",
  "Yeah, you're both from Boston, Massachusetts.",
  "I think maybe -- maybe we have to make it up, what the limitation -- I mean, you're quite right, everything's related to everything else. And we've had trouble with the same -- the very same words with ERISA, and -- and started off trying to give it its -- its apparent meaning, \"related to,\" and we finally concluded you can't do that. So what do you want us to make up? What kind of a limitation do you --",
  "Related to -- related to -- related to the movement of the property. That's the problem. It's the \"related to\" words.",
  "I don't understand what you just said. Say it again.",
  "Service where? Service where?",
  "Storage, ah. I see.",
  "How do we discover that? Do we look into the city council hearings or what?",
  "No, I want to be able to look at the law and say the law is preempted or the law isn't preempted. Don't tell me -- you know, the purpose of the law is this or that. That's not something I am able to do.",
  "Yes, that's factual. But whether the intent of the city council was this or that is not factual.",
  "I thought that is what you meant.",
  "So it would depend upon how severe the consumer protection law is, is that right? If it's a consumer protection law that really whacks the tow truck operator, that would be different from a moderate, benign consumer protection law? We have to examine each consumer protection law on its own, is that it?",
  "You're -- you're saying that this is off the wall. That's your -- to put it in -- in Justice Ginsburg's terms, right?",
  "So you're saying -- you're saying that the -- that the deference which we give to arbitrator's statement of fact, like the deference we give to a lower court's adjudication of fact, has a limit, that at some point, the distortion of fact becomes an issue, a question of law rather than fact, right?",
  "Do you have other examples from other -- other review that we've given to arbitrators' factual decisions?",
  "I mean, I -- I don't want to adopt a special rule for -- for class actions, but if -- if you're telling me this is just a general principle, that at some point if it's too much off the wall, it becomes an error of law and -- and we can reverse it. What -- what other examples do -- do we have?",
  "No, I want a case. You're --",
  "But that is a class action case. I -- I don't care what it said. I want a --",
  "I want a case where we have, or where Federal courts have with our approval, disregarded a -- a factual finding by an arbitrator because the factual finding was too much off the wall. That there was simply not enough basis to support it.",
  "That's -- that's all he has to do is saying -- you know, I'm -- I'm interpreting the contract, and whatever he says is okay then, right?",
  "I mean, we -- we were concerned in Stolt-Nielsen about a -- a -- a company betting the company, right, on -- on class action whenever -- whenever it agrees to arbitration because class arbitration -- you know, will bankrupt the company and without an appeal to the court or -- you know, not -- not -- not much of an appeal anyway. And you're saying that, in effect, you do bet the company every time. So long as you leave it up to the arbitrator to decide whether there's a class action allowed or not, which most agreements probably do, he can find whatever he likes, right? He can find -- so long as he says, I'm interpreting the agreement, it can be as wildly inconsistent with the agreement as you like and there's nothing the courts can do about it.",
  "And you think that standard -- all that standard means is that the arbitrator has to say is, I am interpreting the contract, even though what he says is flatly, visibly, unquestionably contrary to what the contract says, and the court has to accept that, so long as he says, I'm interpreting the contract.",
  "Just exactly that?",
  "What supports his decision? I mean, you -- you say that. What -- what supports his decision that the parties here agreed, agreed, that's the standard. Did they agree to class arbitration? What -- what supports that?",
  "I don't understand. There is a distinction between all disputes and all actions relating to the dispute?",
  "The top of page 6?",
  "Yes.",
  "But that's not enough. As stated by Justice Breyer, he has to have come to a plausible construction. It's not enough that he said, I'm construing the contract. I have looked at the terms of the contract and what the parties' said, and my construction of the contract is X. That's not enough. It has to be plausible.",
  "Now, why is this plausible?",
  "What's a magic 8-ball? I don't know what you are talking about.",
  "Did these other people agree to this arbitrator? I mean, they might have said, this arbitrator, he's a wild guy, he's going to say that -- that we agreed to class action. We didn't agree to class -- I don't want this arbitrator. They didn't agree to this arbitrator. Why should they be bound by -- by whatever he says?",
  "How can they opt out if they've agreed to class arbitration?",
  "Are you sure? It seems to me if they've agreed to class arbitration, they've agreed to class arbitration.",
  "How many have there been? Have there been dozens, hundreds, thousands?",
  "Do you have any idea?",
  "I'm sure there's been a number. What's the number?",
  "It could be less than 100?",
  "Why -- why are payments not to compete different from, let's say, dividing a market? I mean, suppose there's a lawsuit, somebody challenging the validity of the patent and the patentee agrees to allow the person challenging the patent to have exclusive -- exclusive rights to sell in a particular area. Does that violate the antitrust laws?",
  "That -- that doesn't impress me. What else? What's your second point?",
  "In order to make money. I mean, that's -- that's what it wants is money.",
  "So instead of giving them a license to compete -- you know, we'll short-circuit the whole thing, here's the money. Go away.",
  "Mr. Stewart, do you have a case in which the patentee, acting within the scope of the patent, has nonetheless been held liable under the antitrust laws --",
  "-- for something that it's done acting within the scope of the patent?",
  "This -- this was not a problem, I gather, until the Hatch-Waxman amendments?",
  "Yes, and so -- and so do suits against this kind of payment. And I have -- I have the feeling that what happened is that Hatch-Waxman made a mistake. It did not foresee that it would produce this kind of -- this kind of payment. And in order to rectify the mistake, the FTC comes in and brings in a new interpretation of antitrust law that did not exist before, just to make up for the mistake that Hatch-Waxman made, even though Congress has tried to cover its tracks in later amendments, right, which -- which deter these, these -- these payments.",
  "So why should we overturn understood antitrust laws just to -- just to patch up a mistake that Hatch-Waxman made?",
  "You can't -- you can't possibly figure it out, can you, without assessing the strength of the patent?",
  "Isn't that crucial to -- to the conclusion?",
  "And to say you can consider every other factor other than the strength of the patent is -- is to leave -- leave out the -- the elephant in the room.",
  "I guess the attorney general of this State doesn't have any proprietary interest either, does he?",
  "But -- but he can defend it, can't he --",
  "-- because the law says he can defend it.",
  "Mr. Cooper, let me -- let me give you one -- one concrete thing. I don't know why you don't mention some concrete things. If you redefine marriage to include same-sex couples, you must -- you must permit adoption by same-sex couples, and there's -- there's considerable disagreement among -- among sociologists as to what the consequences of raising a child in a -- in a single-sex family, whether that is harmful to the child or not. Some States do not -- do not permit adoption by same-sex couples for that reason.",
  "I don't think we know the answer to that. Do you know the answer to that, whether it -- whether it harms or helps the child?",
  "But that's a possible deleterious effect, isn't it?",
  "I -- it's true, but irrelevant. They're arguing for a nationwide rule which applies to States other than California, that every State must allow marriage by same-sex couples. And so even though States that believe it is harmful -- and I take no position on whether it's harmful or not, but it is certainly true that -- that there's no scientific answer to that question at this point in time.",
  "I suppose we could have a questionnaire at the marriage desk when people come in to get the marriage -- you know, are you fertile or are you not fertile?",
  "I suspect this Court would hold that to be an unconstitutional invasion of privacy, don't you think?",
  "Strom Thurmond was -- was not the chairman of the Senate committee when Justice Kagan was confirmed.",
  "Who -- who would appoint him? The same governor that didn't want to defend the plebiscite?",
  "I suppose --",
  "You -- you've led me right into a question I was going to ask. The California Supreme Court decides what the law is. That's what we decide, right? We don't prescribe law for the future. We -- we decide what the law is. I'm curious, when -- when did -- when did it become unconstitutional to exclude homosexual couples from marriage? 1791? 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted? Sometimes -- some time after Baker, where we said it didn't even raise a substantial Federal question? When -- when -- when did the law become this?",
  "It's an easy question, I think, for that one. At -- at the time that the -- the Equal Protection Clause was adopted. That's absolutely true. But don't give me a question to my question.",
  "When do you think it became unconstitutional? Has it always been unconstitutional?",
  "That -- that's not when it became unconstitutional. That's when they acted in an unconstitutional matter -- in an unconstitutional manner. When did it become unconstitutional to prohibit gays from marrying?",
  "I'm not talking about the California Supreme Court. I'm talking about your argument. You say it is now unconstitutional.",
  "Was it always unconstitutional?",
  "I see. When did that happen? When did that happen?",
  "Well, how am I supposed to know how to decide a case, then --",
  "-- if you can't give me a date when the Constitution changes?",
  "So it would be unconstitutional even in States that did not allow civil unions?",
  "Okay. So I want to know how long it has been unconstitutional in those --",
  "It seems to me you ought to be able to tell me when. Otherwise, I don't know how to decide the case.",
  "50 years ago, it was okay?",
  "I can't either. That's the problem. That's exactly the problem.",
  "Yeah, but the rest of the country has been cautious.",
  "And we're -- and you are asking us to impose this on the whole country, not just California.",
  "So your -- your position is only if a State allows civil unions does it become unconstitutional to forbid same-sex marriage, right?",
  "It's too late for that, too late for that now, isn't it? I mean, we granted cert. I mean, that's essentially asking -- you know, why did we grant cert. We should let it percolate for another -- you know, we -- we have crossed that river, I think.",
  "Excuse me. If there is no jurisdiction here, why was there jurisdiction at the trial level?",
  "I mean, the government comes in and says \"I agree\" -- or if there was jurisdiction, why did the Court ever have to get to the merits? If you have a, let's say, a lawsuit on an -- on an indebtedness and the alleged debtor comes in and says, yes, I owe them money, but I'm just not gonna pay it, which is the equivalent of the government saying, yes, it's unconstitutional but I'm going to enforce it anyway. What would happen in that -- in that indebtedness suit is that the court would enter judgment and say, if you agree that you owe it, by God, you should pay it. And there would be a judgment right there without any consideration of the merits, right? Why didn't that happen here?",
  "Really, that's very peculiar. When -- when both parties to the case agree on what the law is? What, the -- just for fun, the district judge is -- is going to have a hearing?",
  "I'm not talking about jurisdiction now. I'm talking about why the district court, without getting to the merits, should not have entered judgment against the government.",
  "It has not arisen very often in the past because in the past, when I was at the Office of Legal Counsel, there was an opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel which says that the Attorney General will defend the laws of the United States, except in two circumstances. Number one, where the basis for the alleged unconstitutionality has to do with presidential powers. When the presidential powers are involved, he's the lawyer for the President. So he can say, we think the statute's unconstitutional, I won't defend it. The second situation is where no possible rational argument could be made in defense of it. Now, neither of those situations exists here. And I'm wondering if we're living in this new world where the Attorney General can simply decide, yes, it's unconstitutional, but it's not so unconstitutional that I'm not willing to enforce it, if we're in this new world, I -- I don't want these cases like this to come before this Court all the time. And I think they will come all the time if that's -- if that's -- if that's the new regime in the Justice Department that we're dealing with.",
  "Excuse me. It's not your view. It's the President's. It's only when the President thinks it's unconstitutional that you can decline to defend it? Or what if the Attorney General thinks it's unconstitutional?",
  "Or the Solicitor General, is that enough?",
  "Oh, it can be either the Attorney General or the Solicitor General?",
  "So when Congress enacts a statute, it cannot be defended, it has no assurance that that statute will be defended in court, if the Solicitor General, in his view, thinks it's unconstitutional?",
  "Is that right?",
  "Yes or no?",
  "It's not what the OLC opinion said, by the way.",
  "Didn't Chadha -- didn't Chadha suggest that Congress could have standing in -- in Chadha?",
  "In Chadha, there was an argument that Congress had standing because what was at issue in the case was precisely a prerogative of Congress to exercise the one-house or two-house veto.",
  "I didn't understand that courts were so central to your position. I -- I thought you didn't want the voters in one State to dictate to other States any more than you would want the courts in one State to dictate to other States.",
  "But that's -- that's the same in the example that he just gave you, that discrimination would have been visited on the same group, and you say there it's okay.",
  "So you think that's bad as well, that all three of those have to be treated the same, despite State law about marriage.",
  "I don't understand your answer. Is your answer yes or no? Is there a federalism problem with that or isn't there a federalism problem?",
  "Well, it's just -- all these statutes use the term \"marriage,\" and the Federal government says in all of these statutes when it says marriage, it includes same-sex couples, whether the State acknowledges them to be married or not.",
  "Never mind whether or not it would work? I don't care if it works.",
  "Does it -- does it create a federalism problem?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, it's not doing that, it's just saying for purposes -- just what it's doing here. It says, for purposes of all these Federal statutes, when we say marriage, we mean -- instead of saying we mean heterosexual marriage, we mean, whenever we use it, heterosexual and homosexual marriage. If that's what it says, can it do that?",
  "No, no, no, no. It includes --",
  "Why -- why are you so confident in that -- in that judgment? How many -- how many States permit gay -- gay couples to marry?",
  "Nine. And -- and so there has been this sea change between now and 1996.",
  "Well, I'm curious as to why the methodology of extracting the gene has not been patented. You say everybody -- everybody uses it. Why wasn't that patented?",
  "But you still haven't answered her question. Why? Why would a company incur massive investment if it -- if it cannot patent?",
  "You're still not answering the question.",
  "Curiosity is your answer.",
  "Yes. But, of course, to profit from -- from that recombinant DNA, you have to not just isolate the gene, but then you have to do something with it afterwards. So you really haven't given us a reason why somebody would try to isolate the gene.",
  "I mean, sure, yes, I can do stuff with it afterwards, but so can everybody else. What advantage do I get from being the person that or the company that isolated that -- that gene. You say none at all.",
  "Well, that's lovely.",
  "Do you -- you've really lost me when you say that it's nature that does the alteration rather than the scientist. I mean, whenever a scientist does an alteration, he does it, you know, by some force of nature.",
  "I mean, he doesn't do it unnaturally, does he? I mean, there's some --",
  "Well, well, well, well, this is something I was going to ask you. I -- I assume that it's true that -- that those abridged genes, whatever you want to call them, do exist in the body. That they do exist. You -- you haven't created a type of gene that does -- does not exist in the body naturally.",
  "Even though -- even though a related statute did -- did make an exception for proprietary action, isn't that right? The FAAAA?",
  "The ADA.",
  "Boston Harbor was implied preemption, right?",
  "Some -- some of the rules are okay, though, as you acknowledge, and I guess there's a second question in the case.",
  "You were about to get into that anyway.",
  "Okay.",
  "Or you should stop referring to a key component of interstate commerce. It doesn't matter whether it's key or not, does it?",
  "Does the Federal government inspect trucks for safety and --",
  "-- leaking hazardous materials and such?",
  "Has it ever done that?",
  "You -- you agree with that -- that that provision would apply? I don't see that it applies.",
  "Route restrictions?",
  "I don't think there is. You think there is? You can ask the question.",
  "Seems to me the answer is no.",
  "What exception do you appeal to? There are a number of exceptions there.",
  "What exception are you appealing to from the -- from the preemption provision?",
  "Well, that's a different point, but -- but you're -- you're talking about, you know, an exception for private contract operations as opposed to public matters.",
  "There are exceptions to the preemption and that is not one of them. And other statutes do have exceptions for -- for commercial operations or private operations. This one doesn't.",
  "Do market participants impose civil and criminal penalties?",
  "Ah. Yes.",
  "Is that how we decide these things? When there is on the books a criminal penalty that can apply to everybody, do we let the State come in and say, oh, you know, no harm, no foul because it's on the books, but we -- we don't really use it. Well, I don't know -- I don't know that we do that. If it's there, it's a criminal penalty, and if -- if the condition of -- of -- of you're being able to impose these limitations is that you not have criminal penalties, there is a criminal penalty.",
  "Okay.",
  "I'm not sure that's crucial. You think a State can -- can say nobody's going to come on our highways until it signs a contract? Okay? These highways belong to us, they are State land, and anybody who wants to ride on the highways, you have to enter a contract with the State. And that's going to get around this Federal statute?",
  "Okay. It's a highway only for trucks. It's a truck highway.",
  "Okay? It's specially reinforced and everything, but you have to enter a contract with the State in order to drive your truck on this highway. And that -- that's okay.",
  "I know we're not. That's why it's a hypothetical.",
  "Okay. The State makes money on this truck highway. It's a money-maker, okay?",
  "And that makes it okay?",
  "It was -- it was implied preemption in Boston Harbor. Here you have an express preemption clause which contains exceptions, and among those exceptions is not the running of a commercial enterprise, even though that is made an exception in a number of other Federal statutes -- Federal preemption statutes. That's a very high hill for you to climb, relying solely on the fact that you are a commercial enterprise.",
  "What -- what if they violate those conditions? I mean, that's -- that's where the -- that's where the shoe pinches. What if they violate those contractual conditions? Then do you exclude only the truck that violates it, or do you exclude the whole trucking company?",
  "What's the ultimate? What's the ultimate? You've tried everything else and you whack them with a big penalty. What is that?",
  "I've never heard of this doctrine. This is a facial attack to a contract? Is that it? I mean, you --",
  "We have to attack this contract provision by provision -- or application by application?",
  "I didn't say they were a red herring.",
  "Your -- your argument assumes that the phrase in the statute \"to prevent the breakup of the Indian family\" only applies where -- where the father has custody. I don't -- I don't know why that should be true. If -- if that's what Congress meant, they could have put it much more narrowly. They had a very broad phrase, \"to prevent the break up of an Indian family.\" And this guy is -- is the father of the child --",
  "-- and they're taking the child away from him even though he wants it.",
  "And that -- that is not the breakup of -- of an Indian family?",
  "Oh, I see. You're reading -- you're reading \"Indian family\" to mean something more than -- than a biological relationship, right? You're going to hang a lot of -- a lot of other ornaments on that phrase?",
  "I mean, it seems to me he's the father, the other woman's the mother, that's the -- that's the Indian family, the father, the mother, and the kid.",
  "He's the father. He's the father.",
  "This isn't State law. This is a Federal statute which uses an expansive phrase, \"the breakup of the Indian family.\"",
  "Unless we believe that the Federal statute determines when he has parental rights by defining \"parent\" to include a biological father.",
  "If that's the case, then what you said doesn't apply.",
  "Yes, I wanted you to talk about (f). Are you going to say something about that or --",
  "-- are you going to leave it to the government?",
  "You don't agree with the government's position, do you?",
  "Please finish. Let's finish.",
  "Do you apply a \"best interest of the child\" standard to a termination of parental rights?",
  "I mean, can -- can -- I know a lot of kids that would be better off with different parents.",
  "It sure is. And do you know of any State that -- that applies best interest of the child standard to termination of parental rights as opposed to adoption?",
  "Aren't there Federal definitions of approvals of tribes? Not every group of native Americans who get together can call themselves a tribe.",
  "And isn't one of the conditions of that a condition of blood and not -- not of voluntary membership?",
  "I'm quite sure that's right. So I think the hypothetical is -- is a null set. I don't think it ever exists.",
  "Is my recollection correct that -- that he had offered to -- to marry the mother, and she rejected that?",
  "Well, that -- that was after she had rejected his offer to marry her, no?",
  "I don't know why you make that concession. I mean, your client has been deprived of parental rights. I do not know that -- that it is traditional to decide whether a parent will be deprived of parental rights by assessing what is in the best interest of the child. That seems to me quite - -",
  "-- extraordinary, not normal.",
  "It says that, doesn't it? A parent is -- is the -- the biological parent.",
  "That's what it says.",
  "Wait. I didn't understand. Citizenship, who has acknowledged citizenship?",
  "Okay. I understand now.",
  "That's a very strange way to put it. I mean, just -- just in passing in the sentence, that \"the continued custody.\" I mean, you would think if that's what they meant, they would say, \"where the child\" is -- \"is within the custody of a parent, comma, no termination of parental rights may be ordered, in the absence of a determination,\" blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It doesn't say that. It says, \"No termination may be ordered in absence of a determination, including testimony of a qualified expert, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional.\" When it's -- when it's framed that way, I am -- I am inclined to believe that the \"continued custody\" means looks to the future, the continuing custody by this person in the future. To read into it the fact that -- that the whole provision only applies to someone who is then in custody of the child, that's very strange. That's -- that's not the way somebody would write a provision like that.",
  "That was its intent.",
  "You don't think that that's what its intent was?",
  "It only applies to children of -- to tribal children. And -- and the purpose was to establish much more difficult standards for the adoption of -- of a child --",
  "Now, maybe you -- you disagree with that policy, but that's clearly a policy behind the law.",
  "It didn't say that. It -- its definition of --",
  "Well, it would be up to the jury, wouldn't it? The jury might well agree with Justice Sotomayor, that it doesn't prove anything that he answered a question, right?",
  "The question is whether you can ask the jury to consider that.",
  "He wouldn't say that. He would say one of the indications of his guilt is that he refused to answer the question. No prosecutor would argue that, that alone, would support a conviction, right?",
  "That's the line you're drawing, between his -- his just not answering and his saying, I don't want to answer?",
  "The latter can't be introduce to the jury, but the former can?",
  "Why would you -- why would you draw that -- that line?",
  "Doesn't the mere silence suggest, \"I don't want to talk anymore\"?",
  "But I thought you said he didn't have to do that, if he didn't answer any questions, didn't you? Isn't that what you said?",
  "I assume that applies to all Federal crimes, right? Anyone convicted of any Federal crime can thereafter be subjected to whatever civil restraints Congress later decides are -- are a good idea in order to prevent that crime, that type of crime from reoccurring, right? I mean, nothing peculiar here about sex crimes. Any -- any crime Congress can later decide, you know, it would be a good idea if when -- when a person has committed, I don't know, crime with the use of a gun, we -- we impose retroactively all sorts of different civil limitations.",
  "No, no, that's not the point, that it's -- that it's retroactive. The point is that it is not in execution of a Federal power.",
  "That would be an execution of a Federal power --",
  "-- the power -- the power to prevent that crime and to punish it.",
  "But they have to be imposed simultaneously as -- as the punishment for the crime of which the individual has been convicted. Here, the trial is over, the conviction is over, and then some years later the Federal government decides, oh, it would be a good idea if people who have committed sex crimes are -- are subjected to these limitations. That's quite different from imposing that simultaneously as -- as a punishment for the crime. This is not a punishment for the crime, right?",
  "Yes.",
  "When you say in a civil proceeding, you mean?",
  "So it's just by a preponderance of the evidence we think this guy probably, you know, 51/49, committed a sex crime.",
  "So just -- just more -- more likely than not is the test.",
  "To -- to what does this civil -- civil-criminal line apply? Suppose instead of a registration requirement, Congress just decided, you know, our past punishments for sex offenses have not been -- have not been severe enough, and so we are now going to impose a civil fine on all -- all persons who have been convicted in Federal court of sex crimes. It's a civil -- it's a civil penalty, not a criminal penalty. That's okay?",
  "I find that difficult to believe that --",
  "-- that whether it's ex post facto and impermissible or not is simply eliminated, that issue was eliminated by simply calling it civil.",
  "I'm talking about the -- ex post facto.",
  "Because it's civil.",
  "I -- I find that difficult to grasp.",
  "It -- it seems to me that when -- when you say that as your answer to the Chief Justice, you're -- you're no longer relying on -- on the power to regulate the military. You're relying on -- on some general Federal power to protect citizens against people who have committed any Federal crimes. And I -- I don't see that enumerated power in the Constitution. Yes, I see a power to regulate the military, but your description, it has nothing to do with regulating the military. It has to do with protecting the -- the public at large from people who have committed Federal crimes, military or not.",
  "That's right because it protects Federal functions. The Federal -- the criminal applicability to the armed forces protects the function of regulating the armed forces.",
  "But how does protecting the public at large from people who have committed a crime in the armed forces, how does that have anything to do with regulating the armed forces?",
  "You don't have to go that far though to -- to distinguish the example that Justice Alito just gave. This is not a statute which only requires him to registrate -- to register if he hangs around the military installation. This requires him to register anywhere, you know, in the -- in the wilds of Alaska where -- it's just not this case. And even -- even if you would allow that, and say it is a reasonable -- it has a reasonable connection to the power to regulate the military, to say wherever he goes he has to register is -- is a different question, isn't it?",
  "We've never -- we've never held, have we, that what the Federal government can itself do under the Necessary and Proper Clause it can impose upon individuals to do under the Necessary and Proper Clause. Aren't there two different -- what is necessary and proper for the Federal government itself to do is not necessarily necessary and proper for the Federal government to require private individuals to do.",
  "But that's not unusual. When you're released from the military, for example, you're no longer subject to -- to Congress's jurisdiction over the military. That's a matter of timing too, isn't it?",
  "Not for something that they've done after they left the military. That's a question of timing. Had they left the military when they committed this crime? If so, they can't be prosecuted under -- under that power of the Federal government.",
  "That's part of his sentence. That's part of the punishment imposed. You assert that this is not part of the punishment imposed.",
  "Right. Who knows what they'll do, right?",
  "Why did it make an exception then only for divorce decrees?",
  "I mean, there is an express exception in the statute that the beneficiary can be changed by a decree of divorce.",
  "Now, why would Congress say that while at the same time believing that the beneficiary can effectively be changed without a decree of divorce?",
  "But, you know, the -- the exception suggests another thing besides the fact that it suggests that the only way the second spouse prevails is by a divorce decree. It also suggests that Congress's sole purpose -- that Congress did not have the sole purpose in this statute to make it easy for the insurance company that has to pay out the proceeds to know whom the -- who the beneficiary will be. If that were the case, there wouldn't be this exception for a divorce decree because the insurance company is going to have to look to see if there's a divorce decree on the books, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That obviously shows that Congress in this statute not only had a concern about efficiency of payment, but also had a concern about who gets the payment, right? There's no other way to explain the -- the exception for divorce decrees.",
  "And you think that's the -- that's the purpose of this exception for divorce decrees?",
  "In your experience, a man usually has more children or children in his second marriage than he did in his first?",
  "No, I don't think so, either. I -- I think if Congress was concerned about money for the kids, it would have left the money with the first wife.",
  "Once again, the divorce exception blows away that -- that explanation, that all Congress is concerned about is efficient administration of the plan so long as the insurer will know. You know, just look at the -- look at the -- at the contract, the named beneficiary, pay the money to the named beneficiary, and you're home free. That -- that is blown away by the exception for divorce decrees. The insurer is going to have to check that there hasn't been a divorce since the contract was signed, right?",
  "Okay. They have to check to see if it has been properly filed, right?",
  "I keep -- I keep coming back to the explicit divorce provision, which says when there's a divorce decree, only properly filed, it, without a change by the beneficiary, goes to the new wife, okay. And you're telling us that even without a divorce decree, the new wife will effectively get the money so long as there is a State law that says all -- all proceeds from insurance companies for policies entered into before the -- before the -- the decedent was divorced will go to the new wife. It seems to me that is such a -- such a blatant frustration of the -- not just the purpose of -- of the very text of the divorce provision in the law, which says only if there is a decree properly filed will it go to the new wife. And you're saying, well, it doesn't really matter so long as there's a State law which says it will go to the new wife without a -- you know.",
  "Why did't they just say, look, if the -- if the State law says so, the -- the new wife gets it? Why didn't they just say that instead of -- you're telling me they set up this -- this sick system in which the -- the former wife or the new wife has to sue the former wife to get the money that was paid to the former wife. I mean, my goodness. What -- our courts are crowded with -- with suits between, you know -- why -- why don't they just say, if the State law says it, it goes to the new wife.",
  "Yes, I guess -- I guess you might -- you might respond also that, you know, it's characterized by -- by your -- your friend as a -- a State law having to do with -- with marriage and -- and so forth. Maybe. But maybe it's just a State law having to do with discernment of intent. And here you have a Federal statute and I guess the Federal Congress's assertion of what's the best discernment of intent, in the natural order of things, ought to prevail over the State's assessment of what's -- what's the clearest expression of intent, right? I don't know why it's a family law provision as much as it is a provision of what the presumed intent of -- of a decedent is. And here the -- the Federal Government has spoken to it with respect to a Federal statute, and I don't know why it isn't intruding upon State family law for -- for the Federal Government to -- to assert, in its own right, intent under this statute is -- is determined this way.",
  "Say it again. I didn't understand the point.",
  "What do you mean by, \"partnering\"? How does this partnering differ -- partnering differ from just giving them the money to do the job?",
  "I don't know what you -- what do you mean by, \"partnering\"? You're just saying they are given money to carry out a particular program. Is that all --",
  "Is that all you mean by, \"partnering\"?",
  "To carry out a particular program?",
  "I understand. It is -- it is a naked grant of money to implement a particular program.",
  "Okay. And you call that \"partnering with the Federal government\"?",
  "Terrible verb, anyway.",
  "Well, it isn't just able to do. Are -- are you saying that they -- they just can't make it a prior condition, but they can select applicants on the basis of which ones they know agree with the government's objectives? You -- you have two equally qualified -- technically, two equally qualified applicants, and the government intentionally picks the one whose views on -- on prostitution are -- are similar to the government's. Is -- is that bad?",
  "Well, my goodness. They can't --",
  "-- they can't fund the Boy Scouts of America because they like the programs that the BSA has? They -- they have to treat them equivalently with the Muslim Brotherhood? Is that really what you're suggesting?",
  "Well, then, you can take into account the -- the principles and the -- and the policies of -- of the organization that you're giving funding to.",
  "But you -- you go further than that. In answer to my question, you -- you go further than that, and you say, moreover, even without making it a condition precedent to getting the money, Congress can -- the government cannot intentionally select those people that it thinks are in accord with its views. Right? Isn't that what you said?",
  "I'm not asking what the Court said; I'm asking what you're saying.",
  "Problematic or -- or unconstitutional?",
  "Okay.",
  "Let me -- can I -- can I be sure --",
  "-- I understand what you've just conceded in -- in your response to Justice Breyer? The government could require, as a condition to come into this program and become a partner with the United States, that the recipient not have the viewpoint of favoring prostitution?",
  "Well, you said it's not a viewpoint thing.",
  "I thought that's what you just said to Justice Breyer.",
  "Him or me? You have to choose.",
  "Does it say, \"profess belief.\" I was going to ask you about that. That's not what the statute says. It just says they have to have a policy.",
  "A policy. Which means, I suppose, they have to tell their employees don't do anything to -- to foster prostitution, but they don't have to get up -- get up and announce publicly, we oppose prostitution, do they?",
  "They can get all that without making you profess it, unless -- unless you consider the only -- only profession to be the assurance to the -- to your partner, the United States government, that you -- that you, in, fact oppose prostitution.",
  "To tell the government. Okay. That's -- that's the only profession you're talking about?",
  "Oh, okay.",
  "What is the exact language? Do you want to read the exact language just to refresh our recollection?",
  "When they --",
  "When they take water from the main stream of the Red River, how do they know how much of that water is from Reach V?",
  "They are -- they are entitled to -- to no more than 25 percent from Reach V. Is everything that -- that comes into Texas in the main channel of the Red River water from Reach V?",
  "Now what page are you looking at?",
  "Yeah, okay.",
  "Yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't know --",
  "What --",
  "Reach I. Okay.",
  "Where is this? Where is this? Where is this?",
  "I -- I don't understand what you just said, \"They're riparian States, so they don't track diversions.\"",
  "Why does that follow?",
  "Okay.",
  "Okay.",
  "Isn't that what the word \"extort\" means? You extort something from someone? It means you get it from him, you don't get it from some third party.",
  "Suppose -- suppose that the person coerced here was a -- was a corrupt person and had put his recommendation out for bids. Okay? He said, you know, I'll -- I'll recommend whoever pays me the most money. Would that alter this case?",
  "If -- if then somebody comes in and says, well, I'm not going to pay you the money, but I'll -- I'll break your knees if you don't recommend me, would that be extortion?",
  "What -- what is -- I have a property interest in doing my job? I don't know what that means. I mean, just throwing words around. You are calling doing a job a property interest. Normally when I think of property, I think of something that can be conveyed. Can I convey the -- the doing of my job to somebody else?",
  "But I'm not talking about my labor. I'm talking about my doing the job that the employer has assigned to me.",
  "It's not my -- not my labor in the abstract. Nobody is taking my labor away from me.",
  "Can you cite one -- one extortion case at common law -- or let me put it another way. What is the closest extortion case at common law that you can allude to?",
  "We -- we are using a common law term here, \"extortion.\"",
  "Whatever. What's the closest that comes to this abstract, \"the doing of my job is property\"?",
  "What -- what's the closest New York case?",
  "Well, that -- that's the problem with your New York cases as well. You -- you are focusing on property in another context, where the property is harmed, not whether property is taken. You -- you have neither a New York case nor any other common law case involving extortion where the property taken consists of somebody's doing his job.",
  "I'm not sure that obtainable property and -- and harmable property are one and the same thing, I'm really not.",
  "You are -- you are contradicting what you yourself said a little bit before, which is that property means the same thing for both provisions --",
  "-- for both the obtaining and the harming.",
  "But it doesn't mean the same thing for the harming because there is some property that can't be harmed.",
  "Why is that valuable to me? Why is it valuable to me -- I can see how the job is valuable to me. I get paid to do the job. But why making one recommendation rather than another is valuable to me? I don't think it's valuable to me.",
  "It's only because I'm an honest person that I want to make the proper recommendation, but to say that it has any economic value that I recommend A rather than B? It's -- it's totally neutral whether one is -- is more economically valuable than the other.",
  "That's all very true and an honest lawyer should do that, but that doesn't prove that it's economically valuable for the lawyer to give the right advice rather than the wrong advice.",
  "Oh, I see. I see.",
  "Is what --",
  "Was that one of the choices the jury had?",
  "But not the obtaining of property.",
  "That's true. Not the obtaining the property, right?",
  "What do you think would be covered by coercion that wouldn't be covered by the Government's extortion theory here? Give me an example of -- of coercion?",
  "Well, for example --",
  "Why -- why isn't that property? Why? You know, my -- my choice of marrying whom I want, why isn't that as much property as -- as my ability to -- to perform my job the way I want?",
  "A lot of people marry for money.",
  "Well, it -- it at least makes available the argument that you don't have to go this far, that there are other provisions that would enable you to get to this person.",
  "So why -- instead of inducing us to define property so broadly that it's unrecognizable, as far as I am concerned --",
  "We're talking about property for purposes of extortion, the common law crime of extortion.",
  "I don't think property is property. I think property can -- can have a -- a different meaning with -- with regard to various provisions of the law. And -- and the provision of the law defining extortion brings with it a whole baggage of -- of common law cases. And that may well be different from the word \"property\" used in some other Federal statute that does not invoke the common law of extortion.",
  "I can't understand you very well. Could you -- maybe you have to lift up your mike, or maybe you have to speak more slowly. But I'm having an awful time following you.",
  "Why did they -- why did they include it in a separate section? If they knew that, why did they have a separate section on retaliation?",
  "I understand that. Why did they do it, if they knew it was already included?",
  "No, I really don't understand -- I didn't understand the law to be that. You mean if -- if an employee files a discrimination claim, and then is fired -- let's assume there is no other reason, except retaliation; he's fired for filing that claim -- he has to prove not only that he was fired in retaliation for filing, but also that his claim was valid? Is that what you are saying the law is?",
  "I thought that's what you were saying. I thought that's what Justice Alito's question asked.",
  "In his hypothetical, he did. Justifiable retaliation, as far as I am concerned. I mean, the employer files a frivolous claim to embarrass the employer. He can't erase that from his mind. That's one of the reasons he fired this guy. And you say, oh, if that's one of the reasons, no matter how frivolous or anything else, he's liable under the law.",
  "I don't understand that. Do you understand that?",
  "But -- but not under this statute. What I'm concerned about is the text of this statute, which simply destroys your argument that there's no difference between retaliation and race discrimination. Section 2000e-5(g)(2)(A) limits remedies where a defendant acted -- and this is a quote from the statute -- \"for any reason other than discrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, or in violation of Section 2000e-3(a) of this title.\" It -- it separates out 2000e-3(a), retaliation, from the other aspects of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin discrimination.",
  "Sir, the statute says what it says. It doesn't matter when Congress put it in there. The statute has to be read as a whole. And, if you read it as a whole, this provision clearly separates out retaliation from race discrimination.",
  "Period. I mean, it doesn't -- I don't have to psychoanalyze Congress and say did they really mean it, blah, blah, blah. It's there in the statute. They didn't take it out. The statute still makes a clear distinction between the two.",
  "It might be a good idea, though, and -- and, if so, Congress can do it, right?",
  "I mean, the issue is whether this statute does it or not. The fact that nobody has ever done it before, what difference does that make?",
  "Excuse me. I don't understand. Say it again?",
  "Right.",
  "Yes.",
  "You -- you talk about Congress as though it's a continuing body out there, the same people, and would the same people that did this do that. They are not the same people. I don't know what Congress it was that passed this particular act versus other anti-discrimination acts. Some of them may have been Democratic Congresses, and others may have been Republican Congresses. To -- to assume that there is one Congress out there that -- that has to operate logically in all these areas, it seems, to me, unrealistic. And -- and the best thing we can be guided by is, simply, the text that Congress adopted, however the makeup of that Congress happened to be.",
  "But the maxim that you don't add words where you don't need them doesn't -- doesn't help your case. It hurts your case because, in the other provision that was carried over from the prior law, you -- you were making a nullity of the -- the addition after referring to discrimination on the basis of race, of -- you know, retaliation.",
  "200 years -- 200 years? Did you say that?",
  "Well, I --",
  "I -- I would have thought your -- you can get to your second one, but I would have thought your first response to -- to the question would have been to deny that you say it's clear because the supreme court of Michigan has said so. I thought your argument is it's clear because it's clear.",
  "Ah, okay.",
  "It should have been your first point. The premise is simply wrong. You're saying it was clear because the statute's clear.",
  "He would have been able to raise it. There's a lot of question about whether it would have been successful because, if it had gone up to the Michigan Supreme Court -- the statute was in effect during his first trial?",
  "He could have raised it, but, if it went up to the Michigan Supreme Court, it would have had the same result as here.",
  "And your only -- your only defense would have been, oh, it's a great surprise. But I don't see how it's a surprise if the Michigan law has been, as -- as the Solicitor General of Michigan has described it, that -- that there's a clear tradition. If -- if the statute addresses the area, the courts will not -- will not supplement it by -- by common law additions. Did he not know that?",
  "Why do you say it was firmly -- do you -- do you contest the -- the assertion by the solicitor general that there is no case which -- which acknowledged and held the defense of diminished capacity?",
  "Is that wrong?",
  "What -- what case --",
  "-- lets the defendant off on the basis of diminished capacity?",
  "What case has a holding -- a holding that diminished capacity excuses the crime or mitigates the crime.",
  "Or -- is that correct? Wouldn't -- wouldn't the supreme court have done that if it -- if it thought that at least -- at least it was arguable?",
  "Mr. Mogill, as -- as I understand your burden here, it's -- it's not enough to show that Michigan law seemed to be what you -- what you say it was; but it has to have been --",
  "-- what you say it was.",
  "And it -- there was an avulsive change by the supreme court.",
  "It's -- it's hard to believe that, given -- given the clear text of the statute.",
  "Now, if -- if a prosecutor raised that objection, knowing that the court of appeals would -- would reverse the exclusion, right -- I mean, it's clear what the court of appeals would have done, right?",
  "And, once the court of appeals reversed it and said the trial was infected with that error, could -- could the defendant be retried?",
  "Because he's -- he's convicted and the -- I'm sorry -- he's -- he's --",
  "That's right.",
  "Could he be retried?",
  "Well, then -- then you would be crazy to raise it as a prosecutor.",
  "But he could get an -- an interlocutory appeal on that?",
  "Okay.",
  "Was that -- how often was it mentioned in intermediate court opinions?",
  "Four mentions in the supreme court that say what? That are inconclusive - -",
  "Yeah.",
  "Have we ever held that a State law has been determined to be X, simply because intermediate State courts have uniformly held it to be X? Never mind assumed it to be X, have held it to be X?",
  "It doesn't mean it's right.",
  "You have to show it's right.",
  "That it's the law.",
  "I think he contested that. I think he never went further into it, but he seemed to disagree with the proposition that, where there is a Michigan statute, it can't be supplemented by the common law.",
  "You -- you rely on Reese as establishing the principle that you cannot supplement the defenses in a criminal statute, but Reese was a 2012 case.",
  "I assume you'd need a case in which the prosecutor was pretty -- pretty clear that a diminished capacity defense would prevail. Otherwise, it wouldn't -- the game wouldn't be worth the camel, right?",
  "You want us to say, \"yet again,\" when we write our opinion?",
  "If they were covered securities, right? I mean, you're ­­ you're pledging covered securities to the bank and make a misrepresentation about them, right?",
  "I had assumed that the purpose of the securities laws was to protect the purchasers and sellers of the covered securities. There is no purchaser or cover ­­ or seller of a covered security involved here.",
  "It's ­­ it's a purchaser of not ­­ not­covered securities who is being defrauded, if anyone. Why ­­ why would the Federal securities law protect that person?",
  "It doesn't have to be the plaintiff's, but it has to be somebody's.",
  "Nonexistent purchases, right?",
  "Anyway, Line's not a case of ours, is it?",
  "It's not a case of any court, is it?",
  "It's one of your cases.",
  "Right. We don't have to agree with all of your cases, do we?",
  "What ­­ what troubles me, Ms. Goldenberg, is not the problem of our figuring out these economic consequences, but the text of the statute, which says, \"in connection with the purchase or sale of one of the covered securities.\"",
  "There has been no purchase or sale here.",
  "It can't be in connection with a purchase or sale that has never occurred. I mean, it could be have read in connection with the purchase or sale or the promised purchase or sale or the contemplated purchase or sale, but it doesn't. It says, \"in connection with the purchase or sale.\" I don't know how you can make that stick to a situation where there has been no purchase or sale.",
  "Well, wait. And ­­ and if that's ­­ if that's wrong, you acknowledge you don't win?",
  "All right. Okay. So what difference does it make?",
  "And you really don't agree with that anyway.",
  "Well, if you're correct that the two are one and the same, how ­­ how is it that we have authorized district courts to do the one or the other? We ­­ we have not required district courts to reach the merits if they're ­­ if they can resolve the question on ­­ on the basis of qualified immunity alone. Well, how can that be, if the merits are necessarily part of the qualified immunity determination?",
  "Maybe ­­ well, maybe you better say a few words about the merits?",
  "Yeah, but that's not what the Seventh Circuit held. I mean, that ­­ that may well be, but we're asked to review a holding by the Seventh Circuit that, even if you aren't covered, even if you're not exempt, you still have a 1983 claim. That's ­­ that's why we took this case. And now, you're ­­ you're telling us we should not review what the Seventh Circuit held. And that would, presumably, remain the circuit law, right?",
  "Counsel, I'm trying to ­­ trying to see how ­­ how many of these arguments that you have made before us about why ­­ why we can't get to the holding of the Seventh Circuit, how many of them you made in your brief in opposition. I mean, we ­­ we don't like to dismiss a case as improvidently granted, and ­­",
  "­­ only when the ­­ when the case is before us, counsel suddenly finds all sorts of reasons why we shouldn't have taken it in the first place. You should have told us that before we took it in the first place.",

  "Well, that's true, but ­­ but you ­­ you have the duty, or ­­ or counsel for the defendant has the duty to show that counsel did not do that.

The quid pro quo was you avoid the possibility of conviction. But here, she's already been convicted. She had a trial ­­ you know, by 12 fair, impartial jurors, and she was guilty.

  "Counsel, is it ­­ is it correct that the consequence of this provision has been very severe with respect to national political parties?",
  "And ­­ and much of the money that used to go to them now goes to PACs; isn't that what has happened?",
  "So that this is really ­­ you know, turning the dials on ­­ on regulating elections. Now, I ask myself, why would ­­ why would members of Congress want to hurt their political parties? And I answer ­­ I answer to myself ­­",
  "­­ well, ordinarily, the national political parties will devote their money to elections in those states where the incumbent has a good chance of losing. So, in fact, if you're an incumbent who cares about political parties, I don't want money to go to my opponents. And if you ­­ if you turn down the amount of money that the national political parties have, that's that much less money that can be devoted against you if you're challenged in a close race.

  "What a surprise.",
  "And that does not ­­ that does not evoke any gratitude on the part of the people? I mean, if gratitude is ­­ is corruption ­­ you know, don't those independent expenditures evoke gratitude?

  "It's not that we're stopping people from spending big money on politics.",
  "Wait. That ­­ that ­­",
  "That line eliminates some of the arguments that have been made here, which are arguments against big money in politics. There ­­ big money can be in politics.

I mean, it seems to me the latter is much more identifiable, and there is nothing in the law that excludes that. So apparently, that's not too much of a risk.",
  "It is what it is, though.",
  "I was just going to ask, if the question were determined of whether the sham transaction counts as an erroneous statement of the basis, if that were determined at the partner level and not in a partnership proceeding, would it be possible to have different outcomes ­­",

  "And ­­ and you have to relitigate the same issue.",
  "Excuse me. Why would it vary from partner to partner?",
  "But it doesn't just say partnership items.

  "What ­­ what can that possibly mean when you're talking about the applicability of any penalty?",
  "That penalty is going to be applicable at the partner stage.",
  "So what?",
  "But it is in addition to partnership item. You say, oh, you can't do that because it would add to partnership items. But the statute does not say \"just partnership item.\" It says \"partnership items, the proper allocation of such items, and the applicability of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount.\"",
  "It's in addition to partnership items.",
  "And ­­ and it's ­­ it seems to me, not enough to say, well, if you interpret that third part to go beyond partnership items, you're destroying the statute. I don't think so.",
  "When would you not have to do that, if you are applying the third item, \"the applicability of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount which relates to adjustment to a partnership\"?",
  "That will always require you to go down to the partner level.",
  "Couldn't the government have pursued this, instead of saying ­­ you know, it's a sham partnership, just ­­ just ­­ couldn't the government simply have said that the partnership overstated its basis?",
  "Now, I have a second question, which I asked your friend as well. Is he correct that, if we rule for you, each partner may have a different result because different courts will find this to be a sham or not to be a sham?",
  "Well, but why ­­ why wouldn't ­­ couldn't one court say I don't think it's a sham partnership?",
  "I didn't get the question. If ­­ if what was ­­",
  "Could ­­ could I ask, what difference would it make to you if ­­ if I thought the venue here is proper, but I thought that there ­­ there was no cause of action in this circuit, and the case ­­ as one of the amicus briefs proposed. What difference would that make to you?",
  "Excuse me. But what if there is no personal jurisdiction, okay, and the ­­ and the suit is dismissed because there is no personal jurisdiction. Would a Federal court transfer it to ­­ to another court that has personal jurisdiction?",
  "But why is that? Why wouldn't 1404(a) continue to apply?",
  "If ­­ but it depends upon ­­ upon the defendant. If he chooses to go the 1404(a) route, he could go that way, couldn't he?",

  "What kind of ­­ what kind of proceedings do they have in there?",
  "Don't ­­ don't put me in the group that thinks you can use forum non conveniens. When ­­ when you have a forum selection clause for a State court and suit is brought ­­ attempted to be brought in a Federal court ­­ I mean, if it's in the Federal court, that is the most convenient court ­­ I mean, let's say it's in ­­ in a different State where all the witnesses are. I think it's very strange to say that, because there is a contract provision requiring it to be brought in a State court, this court is an inconvenient court. I ­­ do you know that the doctrine of forum non conveniens has ever been used that way.",
  "It should have been a Virginia court to make that decision, instead of your friendly, down home Texas court. And that's ­­ you know, that was why the forum selection clause was put in there. It doesn't seem to me such a stretch as you think it is to say that the venue is improper when you have agreed that venue would not lie in this court.",
  "So the ­­ the question is: Is it improper when it's been waived? Is it improper for a court to acknowledge venue when the party has ­­ has said I ­­ I cannot ­­ I cannot bring my suit in this court. I don't think it's a terrible stretch to ­­ to call that improper venue. However theoretical it may be, venue is ­­ is decided by ­­ by statute, of course it is. But people may waive it, and when people have waived it, I don't know that there's a great interest in ­­ in saying that, nonetheless, the venue remains proper. It seems to me you've given it away, and it ought to be ­­ it ought to be the ­­ the court where the parties agree that suit would lie that would decide these ­­ these change­of­venue questions. The provision need not be absolutely dispositive, but to the extent it isn't, that is a call that ­­ that ought to be made by the jurisdiction that the parties agreed to. The whole litigation ought to begin there. They shouldn't have to litigate this change of venue provision in a court where the parties agreed they would not appear. It seems to me terribly unfair.",
  "Why is that? Why is that? Why can't the Court, where you agreed to be sued, apply 1404?",
  "I wish.",
  "Do we have to reach that question? I mean, I guess the Ninth Circuit must have been interpreting the long­arm statute of California, right?",
  "Now, are there ­­ were there California cases that disregarded the ­­ the corporate form?",
  "But the jurisdictional inquiry is conducted on the basis of the California statute, isn't it?",
  "I see. It's ­­ it's California's reference to the outer bounds of jurisdiction that causes ­­ causes this to be a constitutional case?",
  "How do foreign ­­ foreign countries resolve this attribution question? Would ­­ would we be standing alone, or are there a lot of other countries that assert jurisdiction over the parent, if there is general jurisdiction over the sub?",
  "\"By and large\"? Who ­­ who are the small?",
  "Counsel, I've been looking for the text of the California jurisdiction statute. Where is it? I mean ­­ you know, that's what this case is all about, isn't it?",
  "Is it in your brief? Is it in the Respondent's brief? Is it in the Government's brief? I can't find the darn thing.",
  "I don't want the cite. I want the text in front of me, right here.",
  "That's what briefs are supposed to have ­­",
  "­­ all ­­ all of the significant statutes that ­­ that relate to the case.",
  "I don't have the California Civil Code ­­ you're saying it's ­­ it's not in the briefing?",
  "Mr. Russell, I'm still hung up on ­­ on why we have to confront a Federal constitutional question. It doesn't seem to me that a State statute which says we want to exercise jurisdiction to the extent the Constitution permits ­­ I don't think that invites a Court to restructure standard State law and to say, we're ­­ we're not going to observe the corporate distinction. I guess you'd have to say we can hold the individual shareholders of a corporation liable because that might not violate the Constitution. I don't think that when ­­ when California adopts this statute it means to change its ­­ its standard law regarding corporations, regarding individuals, and so forth. Why ­­ why should we assume that?",
  "Mr. Russell, could I ­­ does it not follow from ­­ from your argument that a Federal court should entertain a suit against the shareholders of a foreign corporation when that foreign corporation has sufficient contacts in California?",
  "Why ­­",
  "Why is it any less fair?",
  "Don't the shareholders?",
  "Don't the shareholders?",
  "I can't see a distinction. And I think, if you stretch the California statute as far as you're stretching it, you ­­ you have to assume that California would exercise jurisdiction in that case ­­",
  "­­ if you're the Ninth Circuit.",
  "I'm sorry Chief.",
  "If this is as ­­ as Justice Breyer and I seem to think, a question of State law, don't you think it's extraordinary that the Ninth Circuit could make such a significant holding on ­­ on California law without ­­ there is a certification procedure in California, isn't there?",
  "So why ­­ why wouldn't they have asked the California Supreme Court whether ­­ whether this jurisdiction statute was meant to alter corporate law or ­­ you know, tort law, or ­­ you know ­­ just imagine any change in law that would bear upon jurisdiction, and all those changes must be assumed to have happened. Couldn't ­­ couldn't they ask that? Is that what this California jurisdictional statute means?",
  "Is it too late to ask it now?",
  "You think it should be billions of dollars, right? We're talking about percentage, right?",
  "So we've got to pick a dollar amount, rather than a percentage.",
  "Why ­­ why doesn't the Fourth Amendment violate the rule you're saying ­­ or the 14th Amendment violate the rule that you're proposing? I mean, I'm ­­ I'm a minority and I want laws that favor my minority. Not just in university; everywhere. My goodness, I can't have that through the normal legislative process. I have to get a constitutional amendment to do it, right?",
  "Well, so I guess ­­ I guess that on this subject of equal treatment of the races, we can eliminate racism just at the ­­ at the legislative level, can't we?",
  "And you can't change those rules by normal legislation, correct?",
  "So if you're a minority that wants favored treatment, you're just out of luck.",
  "No, but the constitutional amendment is not the ordinary political process.",
  "It's not a racial classification. You should not refer to it that way.",
  "It's the prohibition of racial classifications.",
  "Every prohibition of racial classification is itself a racial classification?",
  "Well, if that's how you're using racial classification, I thought it meant, you know, it's directed at blacks or Asians ­­",
  "­­ or ­­ no. In that sense, the 14th Amendment itself is a racial classification, right?",
  "In that sense, the 14th Amendment itself is a racial classification, no?",
  "My goodness, I thought we've ­­ we've held that the 14th Amendment protects all races. I mean, that was the argument in the early years, that it protected only ­­ only the blacks. But I thought we rejected that. You ­­ you say now that we have to proceed as though its purpose is not to protect whites, only to protect minorities?",
  "Right.",
  "And unless that exists, the 14th Amendment is not violated, is that right? So if you have a banding together of various minority groups who discriminate against ­­ against whites, that's okay?",
  "Do you have any case of ours that propounds that view of the 14th Amendment, that it protects only minorities? Any case?",
  "Your opponent says otherwise. He says that minority students have taken tougher courses, they have been better qualified to be admitted, and all sorts of other benefits. So it's certainly a debatable question.",
  "You're changing your answer, then. Your answer to the Chief was it does depend and now you are saying it doesn't depend on whether it benefits minorities at all, it's just whether it places a ­­ a greater burden on minorities to change it. Which is it?",
  "One or the other?",
  "Well, you know, I guess there are answers to these ­­ to these legal questions, whether it's the first filing or if supplemental documents are required, it's the second filing. There's an answer, you know? Some court will provide the answer. The mere fact that ­­ that provisions in a contract are subject to various interpretations doesn't make the provision invalid. It means something. We just don't know right now what it means until ­­ until a court provides the answer. But, wow, that's not different from any contract.",
  "But it hasn't undermined the framework. I mean,the Petitioner had a year. I mean, I can understand if ­­ finding that a particular case is ­­ is not filed too late when indeed there was ­­ there was no time to do it. But here they ­­ they had a year. Why ­­ why does that undermine the framework? If and when they don't have enough time, the court can say the ­­ this suit is not precluded.",
  "So what?",
  "Counsel ­­",
  "Well, that's ­­ that's the internal claims. Do you know any other instance in which ­­ when a suit can be brought in ­­ in Federal court will be determined by an agency?",
  "An agency saying you've got to sue within 1 year, you've got to sue within 6 years. Offhand, I can't think of any, and ­­ and I think it goes well beyond what ­­ what the Executive is authorized to prescribe.",
  "You know any other instances where ­­ where a Federal agency has, in effect, prescribed the running of the statute for the courts? Maybe there are some, but I don't know of any.",
  "They don't have to provide benefits at all, do they?",
  "And if they do, they do it on their own terms.",
  "Why wouldn't equitable tolling apply if you don't have enough time to prepare the court suit? You have just a month, let's say, and it's not your fault because you pursued the administrative proceedings vigorously and promptly. Why wouldn't it be applicable?",
  "So these seven people, nine people ­­ how many were there? Over 40 years, they probably had a way out?",
  "Do you have any position on whether the executive can prescribe when ­­ when suit must be brought?",
  "They're not going to do this for a lobby of nine people, are they?",
  "I thought that this contract required exhaustion of administrative remedies before you can sue. Isn't that in the contract?",
  "So it's not a judge­created doctrine.",
  "I mean, we create it in other instances where ­­ where there are agency, you know, requirements to go through the agency, and we ­­ we make it up. But here it's ­­ it's in the contract, isn't it?",
  "So we are not as entitled to fiddle with it as much as we are when it is our creation, I suppose.",
  "Well, I ­­ you know, I ­­ I Find it hard to think that ­­ that the right of property is any more sacrosanct than the ­­ the right to freedom of the person, and we allow a grand jury indictment without ­­ without a separate mini­trial to justify the arrest and ­­ and holding of ­­ of the individual. And if he ­­ if he doesn't have bail, he's permanently in jail until the trial is over. And we allow all of that just on the basis of a grand jury indictment. And you're telling us it's okay for that ­­ maybe you think it's not okay for that. But I think you're saying it's okay for that, but it's not okay for distraining his property. I ­­ I find it hard to ­­ to think that it's okay for the one and not okay for the other.",
  "Ah, okay. This is a bigger case than I thought.",
  "Is this only in the case where the person has no other assets, where all of his assets are seized, so that he can't ­­ he can't hire counsel? Suppose only half of his assets are determined to ­­ or asserted by the government to have been the product of criminal activity, and he has a lot of other money with which he can hire an attorney. Is that a different case? And we're not ­­ that's not before us here.",
  "So you have a hearing on whether he has other money, right?",
  "Well, that's terrible. We shouldn't allow that. We shouldn't even hold the fellow. We've been doing it for a thousand years, though, and –and it's hard to say that it violates what ­­ what our concept of fundamental fairness is.",
  "But a grand jury indictment doesn't ­­ doesn't establish that there is probable cause to believe that the person is a flight risk. That doesn't contradict what the grand jury found. You're asking the judge here to contradict what the grand jury found.",
  "And in the next case we have, if we agree with you, will be somebody saying due process does not allow you to proceed with a trial when it has been found by an impartial judge that there is no probable cause. That will be our next case, right? And you may well argue it. To tell you the truth, I would prefer ­­ to save your client, I would prefer a rule that says you cannot, even with a grand jury indictment, prevent the defendant from using funds that are in his possession to hire counsel, don't need a hearing, just ­­ just it's unconstitutional for the rule to be any broader than withholding money that the defendant does not need to defend himself. Would you like that? I­I really prefer it to yours. I think yours leads us into really strange territory.",
  "Does this hearing include an assessment of the reasonableness of attorneys' fees? I mean, if you're only withholding the amount of money necessary for the defense, what if this fellow wants to hire Clarence Darrow? Does ­­ does that give him all the money? How ­­ how do you decide that issue?",
  "But does he know his lawyer ­­ is his lawyer there saying ­­ you know, this is the lawyer I'm going to hire and here's the fee I'm going to charge?",
  "But you ­­ you acknowledge that that could be ­­ that could be an issue in the hearing in other cases.",
  "I­I don't know what the fees are. I don't even know who the lawyer's going to be. This defendant just comes in and says, I want to hire a lawyer. And the court says ­­ you know, any particular lawyer? No, I just want a lawyer. The court's going to have to make up a fee, I assume, right?",
  "Okay. He has to choose a lawyer before this hearing, right?",
  "Tell me something because I don't know the answer. Can ­­ can the government track tainted funds that ­­ that have been given to other people, including lawyers?",
  "I think they can, too. So what happens if this lawyer gets his $500,000 and you've had the traceability hearings, so these are tainted funds? If he is convicted, he gives the money back?",
  "The ­­ the ­­",
  "Why? Why do we have to decide it that way? I mean, I don't like casting into doubt the judgment of the grand jury, but why couldn't we say that, when you're taking away funds that are needed for hiring a lawyer for your defense, you need something more than probable cause? Couldn't we make that up?",
  "And then say due process requires something more than probable cause?",
  "Of course, that would ­­ that would be true, the last would be true, even if the defendant had not sought to introduce expert evidence of his own, right?",
  "Of course, the issue is not whether the State can call its own expert. The issue is whether the State can compel him to speak to its expert ­­",
  "­­ without which the expert can testify, right?",
  "But sort of coming back to Justice Ginsburg's question, the Kansas Supreme Court held that the introduction of ­­ of the allegedly compelled testimony given to the ­­ to the psychiatrist violated the Federal Constitution. But why didn't ­­ why didn't the Kansas Supreme Court simply hold that there was no ­­ no right on the part of the prosecution to obtain that rebuttal evidence or to introduce it since this was a case of voluntary intoxication? You ­­ you tell me that Kansas does not allow this just for voluntary intoxication, and that was ­­ that was the defense he was raising, right?",
  "That's what they did. So when ­­ when we send it back, is it still open to them to decide that, under Kansas law, the testimony was not introducible?",
  "And that is, as you say, a question of ­­ of Kansas law, so it would be odd for us to resolve that anyway.",
  "I'm saying the question of whether the ­­ the cross­examination went beyond the scope of the direct and whether that invalidated it, that wouldn't be resolved under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but rather under Kansas law, right?",
  "It seems to me ­­",
  "Well, wait. I mean, all the State ­­ I think it oversimplifies it to say that when ­­ when the defendant puts it at issue, the government can respond. Yes, the government ­­ the government can respond with whatever evidence it has, but the issue here is not whether the government can respond. The issue is whether the government can compel the defendant to undergo a psychiatric examination. That's ­­ that's quite a different issue really from whether the government can respond. Of course it can respond.",
  "More precisely, it's not that the State can have its own expert. It's that the State can compel the defendant to testify to an expert ­­ can compel the defendant to speak to a psychiatrist. That's really the issue, not ­­ not whether the government can respond. Of course, it can respond.",
  "But Kansas decided the constitutional question, and we can't send it back unless we reverse the Supreme Court of Kansas. So you say we're going to dodge the constitutional question? How can we? I think it has been decided by the Kansas Supreme Court.",
  "On what basis can we vacate? We can't vacate a decision, unless there's something wrong with it. What's wrong with it?",
  "That's ­­ that's error? I mean, I understand it's general policy you don't reach a constitutional question unless you have to, but I've never heard of the proposition that, if a court unnecessarily reaches a constitutional question, it can be reversed, that we can send it back and say, don't reach the constitutional question.",
  "I don't think so. Kansas decided the constitutional question. We took the case in order to decide that, and I think we have to decide it.",
  "Of course, there is nothing unusual about saying, if the defendant introduces certain evidence, he has to forfeit some of his Fifth Amendment self­incrimination rights.",
  "It happens every time the defendant chooses to testify.",
  "He need not testify, but if he introduces that evidence, he must submit to cross­examination and has to incriminate himself. And this is, it seems to me, quite similar. He need not introduce the evidence of the psychiatrist, but if he does, he has to forfeit his Fifth Amendment right not to talk to a psychiatrist.",
  "I understand that. But it's still ­­ it's still the same ­­ the same correlative system playing ­­",
  "If the defendant does one thing, he has to accept what goes along with it, and that includes waiving or forfeiting his ­­ his right not to incriminate himself.",
  "That's not getting into the defendant's mind.",
  "It's only the psychiatrist who can get into the defendant's mind when he is ­­ when he is raising a mental capacity defense.",
  "When you say as the price for putting on his defense, you mean as the price for introducing the testimony of a psychological expert?",
  "I'll bet you the prosecution would accept your alternative in a heartbeat.",
  "No defendant can introduce any psychiatric evidence. That's a good deal for the prosecution.",
  "I resent that.",
  "Tools and what?",
  "Scabbards.",
  "I lived in Chicago when it never got above zero for two weeks.",
  "You don't want to say they are \"wearing guns,\" not in this case.",
  "And holding guns.",
  "But common usage doesn't separate from the meaning of clothes only those ­­ those protective garments that are required by the occupation, that are required by the employer. That's a ­­ that's a very strange definition of clothes. Hunters, when ­­ when they're hunting birds wear ­­ wear trousers that are brush­proof. They ­­ you know, resist briars and other things. Those are protective. And those ­­ those pants wouldn't be worn elsewhere. Now, I can understand you're arguing those are not clothes because they perform a protective function other than heat and cold. But you're ­­ you're proposing a very odd definition of clothes. It excludes only those protective garments that are protection against workplace hazards. That's very strange.",
  "No, but you have taken it on. You're trying to tell us what is the ordinary meaning of clothes. That's what you're appealing to, the ordinary meaning.",
  "And I suggest the ordinary meaning is not ­­ is not what you ­­ you have proposed.",
  "It includes protective garments, and ­­ and you want it to include all protective garments, I guess, except those that protect against workplace hazards. That's peculiar.",
  "I think ­­ I think the government is ­­ you and the government are fighting simply because the government is being principled. The word of the statute is \"clothes.\" And nobody would consider eyeglasses or a wristwatch or some of this other specialized equipment to be clothes. I mean, the word is what it is. And ­­ and, I mean, it's wonderful to say, we can eliminate all the problems by ­­ you know, saying everything is clothes ­­ you know, everything, no matter what, wristwatch, eyeglasses. Well, yes, it makes a ­­ a lovely world. But it does not adhere to the words of the statute, which says, \"clothes.\" Doesn't that mean anything? Everything is clothes.",
  "Well, if it doesn't matter, why make a liar out of us? You know, why ­­ why make us say something that ­­ that everybody knows is not true, that everything you put on is clothes.",
  "Earrings, eyeglasses, whatever.",
  "You ­­ you cannot get that very precise limitation out of the word \"clothes.\" You just can't. And say it’s only protective gear for work, it's not other protective gear. Okay? It's only those earrings you have to wear for work, otherwise, earrings are not clothes. Ah, but if they're required for work, they become clothes. That ­­ it doesn't make any sense.",
  "Are there no non­unionized employers that ­­ that have to confront this problem, and they have to pay ­­ they have to pay for work time, no?",
  "Yes, and everybody else has to pay for the ­­ for the changing time, right?",
  "It is, so you ­­ so you have the same issue there, don't you?",
  "And ­­ and the union cannot pull your chestnuts out of the fire.",
  "I don't know.",
  "You want us to say it's incidental, instead of de minimis?",
  "What ­­ what's the consequence of calling it \"incidental\"?",
  "Too complicated is why.",
  "Do you have any preference as to which of those errors you would like us to rely on?",
  "Of course, the venue question does not ­­ does not bring into the Court a constitutional question and the jurisdictional ­­ the jurisdictional one does.",
  "And we usually try to avoid constitutional questions.",
  "It's the largest market for everything, isn't it?",
  "Did the affidavit ever get to Nevada?",
  "Ms. Sherry, you ­­ would you want us to decide this case on the jurisdictional question or the venue question?",
  "I ­­ I understand that. That's why I asked the question.",
  "They didn't really injure a person in State B here. I mean, these people were in Georgia when the injury occurred.",
  "So you're really arguing for a very broad principle. Whenever there is an intentional tort, you can be haled into court at the place of residence of the person against whom the tort is committed.",
  "No, that's what I thought you were saying.",
  "Was the money here in Georgia the whole time?",
  "Was it still there in that locker?",
  "Well, you could say that about whatever rule we adopt. Once we adopt the rule, when ­­ the defendant will know that, if he violates that rule, he's going to be haled into court.",
  "I mean, it's sort of a self­fulfilling point you're making.",
  "Well, but you are libeled wherever it is published. You don't have to be there where it's published. You are libeled wherever it is published.",
  "So ­­ so you could say that Calder, far from being an expansive decision, was a narrowing decision. It said ­­ you know, there's jurisdiction not necessarily everywhere where the libel was published, which is where the injury occurs, but there is jurisdiction only ­­ only in California, where these other connections existed.",
  "Except it's harder for you to establish that the injury occurred in Nevada.",
  "But our jurisdiction cases have not been based on where you expected to be sued. You could expect to be sued anywhere if the State says you are going to be sued here. Our cases have focused on whether the State has jurisdiction, whether the State has enough connection with it to assert its power; not the expectation of the defendant, but the power of the State. That's what's going on here.",
  "That's your new test, just whether you could expect this to happen?",
  "You say the affidavit wouldn't give rise to a Fourth Amendment claim.",
  "But ­­ but you could say that about any declaratory judgment action. You can say the person bringing the declaratory judgment action is seeking the relief. And if ­­ if we follow what you said, that then the burden shifts in every declaratory judgment action. And it clearly doesn't. I mean, we ­­ we've said, time and again, that the burden of proof normally does not shift. What's different here?",
  "It seems to me it is often the case, in declaratory judgment actions, that the defendant in the action cannot counterclaim. I mean, it typically occurs when somebody doesn't want to be in breach of contract and ­­ and brings a suit to see ­­ you know, claiming if I do this I won't be in breach. The other side can't counterclaim because the person hasn't been in breach. The whole purpose of the declaratory judgment statute is to enable you to sue before the other side has a cause of action against you. That's the whole purpose of it. So ­­ so why should the fact that the other side doesn't have a counterclaim change anything? That's usually the situation.",
  "But we are not dealing with the normal default rule. We are dealing with a declaratory judgment statute, and we've said, time and time again, that it doesn't alter the burden of proof. And your response is, well, it does when the other side can't counterclaim. And my response to that is, usually, the other side can't counterclaim.",
  "Then the Declaratory Judgment Act doesn't change it; that's your position? What do you do about the res judicata problem? Let's assume that we put the burden of proof where you want it. Okay? So this declaratory judgment action is defeated. All right? Nonetheless, they say, still and all, we are going to go ahead and not pay any royalties. And, then, you bring ­­ you bring an infringement action, right?",
  "Is ­­ is the prior decision res judicata, or are you going to have to relitigate the whole thing, but, this time, with the burden of proof on you?",
  "Why not? You never ­­ you never established that you're entitled to any ­­ any infringement damages.",
  "No, you ­­ you would normally have the burden as ­­ as the person claiming infringement.",
  "Of course.",
  "Right? So you'll have to relitigate the whole thing because you ­­ you never established that there was infringement. In the declaratory judgment action, all you've established is that they didn't prove non­infringement.",
  "So we have to relitigate the whole thing.",
  "What's the alternative?",
  "It's my hypothetical, okay?",
  "So your answer is, Justice Scalia, you're right, but it doesn't matter very much. That's your answer, right?",
  "Okay.",
  "The Declaratory Judgment Act is addressed to potential coercion, not actual coercion. That's the whole point. You should be able to bring the suit before coercion is applied. Now, it is true that you're not applying coercion right now, but what they're worried about is, if they stop paying the royalties, you will apply coercion, and the Declaratory Judgment Act is a way of getting this on the table before a court without their having to go into default and incurring all the penalties, but it is not intended to shift the burden of proof.",
  "It does shift the burden of proof because if what they are worried about is your claiming infringement and ­­ and exacting a penalty from them for their not paying the royalties that the agreement provides, okay, that's what they are worried about. The Declaratory Judgment Act enables them to sue beforehand, before they incur liability. That's its whole purpose, and its purpose is not to shift the burden of proof.",
  "You can always say that in declaratory judgment actions, that is not the situation we face. The Declaratory Judgment Act posits a hypothetical situation. It always does.",
  "I am worried that you are going to sue me later. You are not suing me now. That's not the situation I face. But I worry that you will sue me later.",
  "They don't want to ­­ they don't want to continue to pay royalties. That's the point. That's why they bring the Declaratory Judgment Act, so that the court can tell them, you don't have to pay royalties because this stuff is not covered.",
  "Well, we didn't take this case to ­­ to decide the Commerce Clause question, did we? The government didn't even assert it below. It asserts it now, but as we took the case, the issue was whether the treaty supported the ­­ the laws.",
  "Mr. Clement, I ­­ I don't understand how ­­ how you distinguish Sarin gas. Why is Sarin gas different from vinegar?",
  "So your answer is if ­­ if that unimaginable thing should happen, it would be okay?",
  "All right.",
  "I'd like to ­­ I'd like to explore that, your proposition that there's no daylight between the treaty itself and the implementing legislation. It seems to me there ­­ there's a lot of daylight between the two. Let's take ­­ and I pick this example, not because it's controversial, but because it relates to an area where the Federal government has never been thought to have authority, namely family law. There are no ­­ you know, Federal marriage, Federal divorce, Federal adoption. It's all been State law. Let's assume that an international treaty is approved by two­thirds of the Senate and the president which requires States to ­­ to approve same­sex marriage. All right? Now, if ­­ if that were a self­executing treaty, same­sex marriage would have to be approved by every State. If it is not self­executing, however, it will be up to Congress to produce that result, and Congress would do it or could do it at least by having a Federal marriage law. And then you would have to have a Federal divorce law and, I suppose, a Federal adoption law. I think there is a big difference between just doing it through a self­executing treaty and dragging the Congress into ­­ into areas where it has never been before. I think there is daylight between the treaty and requiring the treaty to be implemented in the fashion that ­­ that you assert is necessary here.",
  "I don't think it has to be the case. I think there ­­ there's a great difference between requiring the states, by a self­executing treaty, to permit same­sex marriage and dragging the Federal government or allowing the Federal government to enter into this whole field of marriage, divorce, adoption, family law, where the Federal government has never been.",
  "Do horses eat potatoes? I didn't know horses ate potatoes.",
  "Well, all of those quotes pertain to self­executing treaties. Yes, there is no limitation on what ­­ what the President and the Senate can impose as a self­executing requirement, namely, that the States must give back to British citizens property that they confiscated or whatever else. But it's a different question whether a treaty can expand the power of the Federal Congress into areas that it has never been before. That's a separate question. And neither Hamilton, nor any of the other quotes that you refer to, address that question.",
  "When ­­ when aren't they?",
  "Counsel, especially in cases that involve jurisdictional issues. It seems an awfully ­­ awful waste of counsel's time and client's money to be litigating about which court you ought to be in, and it seems to me, to avoid that, the lines ought to be clear. And it doesn't seem to me that the line ­­ you know, whether there is a significant State interest involved or not, is a clear line. You can argue about that in almost any case. So I'm disinclined to use that kind of a ­­ of a test along with any others. Why can't we just limit ­­ limit Younger abstention to the three categories discussed in NOPSI, and say, that's it, no more?",
  "Any purely civil case that raises that kind of an issue can arguably be subject to Younger abstention; is that right?",
  "What ­­ what are those?",
  "Yes, but the attorney general says that that's not what's going to happen here. How do you square that with his statement that that money will not get to these people?",
  "He says you can't ­­ he says you can't even identify those people.",
  "What ­­ what do you do about this ­­ this language in the definition? I haven't heard you explain it. It ­­ it says ­­ it means any ­­ mass action means \"any civil action in which monetary relief claims of 100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs' claims involve common questions of law or fact.\" Now, they're not proposed to be tried jointly here on that ground. They're being tried jointly on the ground that the suit is being brought by the attorney general under this State statute.",
  "Yes, I understand that.",
  "Sometimes, Congress doesn't do it right, you know?",
  "Sometimes, they try to catch everything, but the language they use doesn't do it.",
  "You mean it's contrived legislative history? I can’t imagine.",
  "Did not the Fifth Circuit decide that State law question?",
  "And that's what I understood the Fifth Circuit to have held.",
  "We should ­­ we should ­­",
  "We should assume ­­ to ­­ to make it parallel to what occurred here, that the next day, before the same committee, a Muslim would lead the invocation and the day after that, an orthodox Jew. I mean ­­",
  "­­ it makes a difference whether it's just one ­­ one denomination that is being used as ­­ as chaplain or open to various denominations.",
  "But you ­­ but you ­­ you had no problem, Mr. Hungar, with the marshal's announcement at the ­­ at the beginning of this session. \"God save the United States and this Honorable Court.\" There ­­ there are many people who don't believe in God.",
  "So that's okay?",
  "Why ­­ why is that okay?",
  "I don't really understand your ­­ your answer. How can it be that, if the practice existed in the past, it was constitutional? Was it constitutional in the past?",
  "If it was constitutional in the past, why ­­ why would it be unconstitutional if the same thing is done today, even without any past parallel practice? That's a nice alliteration.",
  "Is past parallel practice essential?",
  "Mr. Hungar, what ­­ what is the equivalent of prayer for somebody who is not religious?",
  "What would somebody who is not religious ­­",
  "­­ what is the equivalent of prayer?",
  "From what?",
  "Perhaps ­­",
  "You agree that coercion is the test, however?",
  "If it is the test ­­",
  "And atheists. Throw in atheists, too.",
  "What about devil worshippers?",
  "Your point is that it coerces ­­ it's bad because it coerces?",
  "If there is ­­ if coercion is the test of the Free Exercise Clause, why do we need a Free Exercise Clause? If there's coercion ­­ I'm sorry ­­ of the Establishment Clause, why do we need the Establishment Clause? If there's coercion, I assume it would violate the Free Exercise Clause, wouldn't it?",
  "So it seems to be very unlikely that the test for the Establishment Clause is identical to the test for the Free Exercise Clause.",
  "This is coercion? He says ­­ you know, he says, \"May we pray,\" and somebody doesn't want to pray, so he stays seated.",
  "Mr. Laycock, it seems to me that what you're missing here is ­­ and this is what distinguishes legislative prayer from other kinds ­­ the people who are on the town board or the representatives who are in Congress, they're citizens. They are there as citizens. The judges here are not ­­ we're not here as citizens. And as citizens, they bring, they bring to their job all of ­­ all of the predispositions that citizens have. And these people perhaps invoke the deity at meals. They should not be able to invoke it before they undertake a serious governmental task such as enacting laws or ordinances? There ­­ there is a serious religious interest on the other side of this thing that ­­ that ­­ that people who have religious beliefs ought to be able to invoke the deity when they are acting as citizens, and not ­­ not as judges or as experts in ­­ in the executive branch. And it seems to me that, when they do that, so long as all groups are allowed to be in, there seems to me ­­ it seems to me an imposition upon them to ­­ to stifle the manner in which they ­­ they invoke their deity.",
  "You want to pick the groups we're going to exclude?",
  "The Baha'i, who else? These ­­ these groups are too small to ­­",
  "Yeah, the atheists are out already. Yes.",
  "Okay. So who else? I mean, you suggest ­­ you say just the vast majority is all that we have to cater to.",
  "Okay. Good. Got that. Number 1, atheists. Who else?",
  "Well, that's ­­ that's ­­ that's really part of the issue, whether they're undertaking a government function or whether they're acting as citizens in a legislative body, representative of the people who bring ­­ who bring to that their ­­ their own personal beliefs. I think the average person who ­­ who ­­ who participates in a legislative prayer does not think that this is a governmental function. It's a personal function. And ­­ and that's why we separate out the legislative prayer from other kinds of prayers.",
  "If you had an atheist board, you would not have any prayer.",
  "I guarantee you because it is a personal prayer that the members of the legislature desire to make.",
  "That's not a prayer. That's not a prayer.",
  "\"How many of you have been saved?\" That's not a prayer.",
  "Well, that's sort of peculiar. I mean, really, I don't see how you can piece it out like that, that it includes employees of contractors, subcontractors, but not ­­ not of any officer. But let me ask you this: If it does include employees of ­­ of an officer, is it ­­ is it as much of a disaster as ­­ as your opponent suggests? That is to say, would ­­ would a firing for something that had nothing to do with the securities laws be swept in?",
  "But it is ­­",
  "It is limited to those subjects. And is ­­ is the personal employee of an officer likely to be involved with any of those subjects?",
  "Of course, it also rules out the accounting firm that is only used once, right?",
  "Well, you just hire them for this one audit; are they a contractor?",
  "I'm not sure. Does that mean yes or no to his question?",
  "Why? Why is it a possible reading? It makes a lot of sense, I agree with that.",
  "I understand that, but ­­ but I think you're ­­ I don't agree with you that ­­ that we don't have to get into these ­­ these other situations, because to my mind, the principal argument made by the Respondent is if you read the statute literally the way you like, it covers a wide range of things that ­­ that one would have no reason to believe Congress wanted to cover. And unless you come up with some ­­ with some limiting principle that ­­ that eliminates that argument, I'm not inclined to go along with your ­­ your broad interpretation of the statute. So, I at least do have to grapple with ­­ with whether there are limitations, with ­­ with what is ­­ what is the central mainstream of the statute and ­­ and what is outside the statute.",
  "This is not the Petitioner's position, however. The Petitioner takes a broader ­­ a broader interpretation as I understood him.",
  "It's sort of post­legislative history, which we usually don't pay attention to. The ­­ the problem that I have is if ­­ if the statute does not cover contractors', subcontractors', firing of their own people, what ­­ what coverage does it have? A subcontractor usually cannot fire somebody from the principal company that's traded on the exchange.",
  "I don't ­­ I don't see how it can harass or threaten either if it's ­­ if it's an employee of another company ­­",
  "­­ that it has no power to fire.",
  "But you ­­ you're ­­ you're eliminating the ­­ the principal contractors who might have that kind of power. You say they're not covered.",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "Including by accountants and lawyers.",
  "How so if ­­ if accountants and lawyers are not ­­ are not contractors?",
  "What does it mean that they're not regulated as contractors here? Unless it means that contractor here does not include them.",
  "It's a very sensible limitation. Unfortunately, it's not there.",
  "I assume you would say that that rulemaking would be ultra vires, if it took the position that the government's taking here, right?",
  "But even if they did and they came out with a rule that reads just the way the government presented it today, you would say that that is an unreasonable reading of the statute, wouldn't you?",
  "Who was it, counsel?",
  "You do not agree, then, that if you know that there's going ­­ that there's a bank robbery afoot and you're cooperating in that, you're ­­ you're the wheelman, and you also know that the ­­ you know that the people who are conducting the bank robbery are carrying firearms, you say that there's no criminal liability for the firearms unless you intended them to use the firearms; is that your position?",
  "No, no.",
  "Now, wait. It would support a verdict ­­ you're saying it would support a finding of ­­ of intent.",
  "Let's assume there's a lot of evidence that he didn't really want them to use firearms, that there's no way you can say he intended them to use, but he knew that they had firearms.",
  "No. No, no, you can't. It's my hypothetical. And you cannot conclude from that. There is so much other evidence. This ­­ this man hates firearms. He does not like firearms. There is no way he could have intended them to use firearms. But he knew they had firearms.",
  "Facilitate the crime.",
  "So you don't have to ­­ you don't have to ­­",
  "Okay. So if you intend a crime ­­ if you intend a crime and you know that the crime is being conducted with firearms, that's enough.",
  "Beforehand. Before ­­ you know beforehand that the crime is going to be perpetrated with firearms. That's all you do. You know beforehand, and you facilitate the crime.",
  "I don't think it's ever harmless error to not instruct the jury ­­ or to instruct the jury not to find one of the elements of the crime. If, indeed, intent is necessary, it seems to me he has to instruct the jury to find intent. It's not up to the court to say, well, there surely was intent anyway so it's harmless error. The jury has to find intent.",
  "I'm surprised to hear you say that you don't need prior knowledge.",
  "Yes.",
  "After you know.",
  "Did ­­ did he facilitate the crime after the shots were fired?",
  "Well, but the crime of conviction was ­­ was a drug offense with the use of a firearm, right?",
  "And so I thought ­­ I thought that the law is pretty clear that if you ­­ if you facilitate an offense, you do not have to facilitate each element of that offense, so long as you have knowledge that that element existed.",
  "But ­­ but more precisely, they could be asked did he facilitate the drug deal knowing that a firearm was going to be used in the drug deal. Would that satisfy you?",
  "I don't understand what your position is. He has to use the gun himself?",
  "But only ­­ you say it's enough to go to the jury and what you would ask the jury to find is intent, right?",
  "Not just to find those facts that were stated by Justice Kennedy.",
  "In addition, the jury would have to find intent.",
  "Okay.",
  "Why ­­ why do you say ­­ you say in context, it was okay. What ­­ what context?",
  "That's it? Just that? \"In order to aid or abet another to commit a crime, it is necessary that the defendant willfully and knowingly associated himself in some way with the crime.\"",
  "Well, asking to extend it, asking to extend it. One doesn't have to overrule it to say, we're not going to follow it to its logical conclusion.",
  "What ­­ what about support of the legislation to­­ to permit slot machines? Was that a promise that the union made?",
  "But as the case comes to us, we assume that there was such a commitment by the union.",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, there would have been a quid pro quo for that, certainly. I mean, the union wouldn't promise that for nothing. It would get something in exchange such as, as in this case, the right to go on the employer's property to ­­ to recruit union members or ­­ or some other thing of value from the employer, right?",
  "Mr. McCracken, the Respondent's brief here asserts that these kinds of precertification agreements have only been common since the ­­ the '90s. Is­­ is that accurate to you?",
  "And he's a big guy.",
  "What about slot machines? You ­­ you mentioned all of the other things promised, but not ­­ not the promise to support legislation.",
  "Mr. Messenger, could ­­ could all of these things that the employer gave to the union be included in a finally­negotiated collective bargaining agreement? Couldn't that CBA say that the union shall have the ability to approach employees on the site, that the union shall have access to the employee list of the employer ­­ and what else, what's the third ­­ and that the employer will not ­­ will not seek to undermine the union? Could all of that be included in a CBA?",
  "Yes. And I suppose ­­ I suppose that would also ­­ it would also follow if ­­ if ­­ with no indication in the text, you simply exclude organizing ­­ the organizing part of labor law. I guess it would mean that the ­­ the union can cut a deal with the employer that if the employer gives them a freehand and ­­ and assists them in ­­ in organizing, the union will promise not to ­­ not to seek a raise in wages or not to seek insurance coverage or whatever. I guess that would also be part of the organizing campaign, right, so it would be okay.",
  "Well, benefits ­­ benefits to the employees always benefit the union. I mean, that's ­­ you know, that's automatic, it seems to me. I don't understand how you say that this is just a gift statute and there doesn't have to be any, anything on the other side, no quid pro quo. You say it's perfectly okay if the ­­ if the employer allows the union to come on his premises to recruit members, but it's not okay for him to agree, to agree to do so?",
  "I don't understand what that means.",
  "And what if the employer does not oppose the union, he neither speaks against it nor for it? Is that giving something of value to the union?",
  "It has no meaning to say you agree to something when you're not getting anything in return. You can promise something without getting anything in return. But to agree? I think that means, you know, I won't do it in exchange for something else.",
  "But if it did happen, you'd say it would be a violation.",
  "Say that again.",
  "By reason of ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "I must say I don't follow that ­­ that line of argument. I mean, it seems to me the treaty sets the framework for an agreement, but it is ultimately the agreement that governs.",
  "But that's no different from the rules we apply when there isn't a treaty, of course. I mean, if the arbitration agreement said that, that the ­­ you know, the agreement is conditioned on, of course. So what else? What different rules would you apply, other than the common­sense rules that we use for arbitration agreements?",
  "We would look to mandatory language in the arbitration agreement.",
  "Why ­­ why are you complaining about the other party not initiating proceedings in the Argentine courts when, if you really wanted those proceedings to occur, you could have initiated proceedings in the Argentine courts?",
  "I must say I don't understand that. When ­­ when you're appealing to a condition for the thing to occur and you can bring that about as ­­ as readily as the other side, it's ­­ dog in the manger comes to mind.",
  "I don't think he conceded it. He conceded that that was your argument.",
  "There's a subtle difference between the two.",
  "They say that only the complaining party can bring a lawsuit. Evidently, they have no declaratory judgment procedure in Argentina.",
  "I was going to ask them that.",
  "So you think Congress really wanted the States to have power to stop illegal gambling on Indian lands, but not to have the power to stop illegal gaming on State lands? Is that ­­ is that the law you think Congress wrote?",
  "Why would anybody want such a ­­ such a disposition?",
  "Well, you think that rule would apply even when, at the time the statute in question was enacted, there was no belief that there was tribal immunity on State lands?",
  "I thought that was just on reservation. You think that was off reservation as well?",
  "Kiowa was later, of course.",
  "You think they read Puyallup that closely?",
  "I see.",
  "But he says that, if they arbitrated, when they tried to enforce the arbitral judgment, you would assert sovereign immunity.",
  "Well, I mean, that's not an answer.",
  "That ­­ that statute was based upon judicial decisions that had ­­ had already held that.",
  "Took it upon itself to accept the Executive's determination of how it ought to play out?",
  "Who made these Indian tribe sovereign? Was it Congress?",
  "I mean, you are appealing to ­­ you know, other branches' determination. Who decided that Indian tribes are sovereign?",
  "Who pronounced them to be sovereign?",
  "This Court.",
  "So I assume that this Court could also determine the scope of their sovereignty.",
  "We do virtually nothing as a matter of common law. We do virtually everything on the basis of the Constitution or statutes. I don't think that that's much of an exception.",
  "If we modified it to make an exception for commercial activities off reservation, could Congress reinstitute sovereign immunity if they wanted?",
  "Maybe we've learned something in 15 years, such as the fact that ­­",
  "No. I think you have to conceive of it that way, but that still makes it a unilateral contract. It's not a promise in exchange for another promise. It's a promise in exchange for the performance of an act; that is, flying the airline ­­ you know, a certain number of miles. You're correct, it is a ­­ a unilateral contract. Now, whether that ­­ that means that there's no ­­ is there no such thing as an illusory unilateral contract?",
  "Well, you ­­ you're not trying to enforce the contract anyway. You ­­ you want to get out of the contract. So you ­­ you ought to be happy to have it pronounced an illusory contract, right? What do you care?",
  "Is that entirely ­­ I mean, suppose the contract said, \"in its absolute discretion and subject to no obligation of good faith.\" Suppose it said that. Would State law still impose an obligation of good faith?",
  "Well, it might well, or it would? I mean ­­",
  "Well, this State, I mean, the State we're talking about.",
  "Well, I suppose you could say that it is assumed that parties to a contract comport with community standards of fairness and decency ­­ you know, you can wiggle to there, if you want.",
  "I don't want to have to sort those out State by State. I mean, it seems to me the ­­ the regime proposed by the Petitioner is ­­ is much more manageable. If it goes beyond the words of the contract, it ­­ and you're reading into it something that it doesn't say, it's a matter of State policy, so I can ­­ I can work with that. But you're ­­ you're asking me to go through each of the 50 States one­by­one to decide, oh, which ­­ which of these are really trying to discern the intent of the parties and which ones aren't, I ­­ especially since you discern the intent of the parties by simply saying, well, parties intend to apply community standards, right? And there'll be different community standards in every State, presumably. Some States are more honest than others, right?",
  "There are variances, but not variances in such an ineffable question as to whether this is really an effort to discern the real intent of the parties or, rather, whether it's an intent to impose community standards, especially since, as I say, parties intend to adopt community standards, usually.",
  "As I understand your argument ­­ correct me if I am wrong ­­ he could be terminated without reasonable cause if he happened to be from a State or if the suit was brought under the governing law of a State, which imposed this obligation of good faith as a matter of law. The State says, regardless of what the contract says, even if it says, in its sole discretion, without any obligation of good faith, even if it says that, as a matter of law, there is an obligation of good faith. As I understand your case, you acknowledge that, in that State, he would simply be out of luck.",
  "He would have no cause of action because this is, obviously, not an interpretation of the contract; it is ­­ it is an imposition of a State requirement.",
  "Okay. I just ­­",
  "Wow, somebody's really been given a raw deal ­­ you know, that's still going to be possible, even if we rule for you here. It depends on what State he's from, right?",
  "Some do; some don't. Some do; some don't.",
  "Ms. Rosenbaum, in ­­ in our decision in this case, do you think we should apply the presumption against preemption of State law?",
  "But the whole purpose of the ADA was to preempt State laws. I mean, I can understand applying that presumption to other statutes, which say nothing about preemption. The whole purpose of the ADA was to deregulate airlines, was to say there was going to be no Federal regulation, let the free market handle it, and there be will be no State regulation. And you want us to apply a presumption against preemption to that statute?",
  "Would this contract produce a different result if it did not contain the words \"in its sole discretion\"?",
  "Well, you'd ­­ you'd ­­ you'd still apply the very same doctrine of reasonableness, right? So the words \"in its sole discretion\" become superfluous.",
  "Yes. I guess different States will treat that differently as well, right?",
  "I find ­­ I find it hard to believe that you're doing nothing but interpreting a contract when you ­­ you give it the same outcome, whether it says \"in its sole discretion\" or does not say \"in its sole discretion.\" I ­­ I find it hard to grasp how what you're doing in that ­­ in that case is simply interpreting the contract.",
  "Why does ­­ it relates to prices. Even if you get credit for miles from staying at certain hotels, it still has the effect of lowering the price for your airline ticket. And, likewise, if you can use your frequent flyer miles to get cheaper hotel rooms, that effectively lowers the price of your airline ticket, doesn't it? I mean, it doesn't seem to me to make any difference whether ­­ whether the only thing you get from the ­­ from the frequent flyer mileage is ­­ you know, is airfares or other goodies. They ­­ they are all price.",
  "I'm sorry. You are talking about a situation where you can assign your ­­ your mileage to somebody else who can get the hotel room?",
  "The person who gets the discount for the hotel room is the person who bought the airline ticket, right?",
  "What you say would apply to other contractual obligations of the airlines, right? So, if the airline says you have to get off the plane if the flight attendant tells you to do so, there is going to be a good­faith obligation attached to that, so you can challenge ­­ challenge those decisions in court?",
  "The Lanham Act goes well beyond the common law, doesn't it?",
  "Okay. But that would be a lot stronger if ­­ if you said the Lanham Act merely, as the Sherman Act was supposed to have done, merely adopted the common law. The Lanham Act doesn't merely adopt the common law. It goes well beyond it.",

  "What is prudential standing? I don't really understand. Is ­­ is it anything other than ­­ should it be renamed statutory standing? It can always be done away with by Congress, right?",
  "And ­­ and is it ­­ is it the kind of standing that we would have to raise on our own? Is it jurisdictional, so that if ­­ if a party hasn't raised it below, it, nonetheless, is still unavailable argument on appeal? Is prudential standing of that sort?",
  "I'm uncomfortable with the notion that ­­ you know, in my prudence I give standing here and I deny standing there, it's just up to me. I can understand Article III. But unless prudential standing means statutory standing, so that I look to the statute to see whom it was intended to empower to bring lawsuits, I am very uncomfortable with the whole notion.",
  "How do you ­­ how do you square that with the statutory provision that the purpose of the law is to prevent unfair competition? Unfair competition, not unfair trade practices. Unfair competition.",

  "I am, too, because I'm sick of it.",
  "I understand. But why should it be \"arguably\"? \"Arguably\"? I mean, under the APA, you are dealing with suits against the government, and it's just funny money at issue. But, when you have private suits, you can drag somebody into court simply because you are arguably within the zone of interest protected? I'm not happy with that.",
  "It isn't whether the interest is reasonable. It's ­­ it's whether it was the type of interest that the statute sought to protect. And ­­ and the term \"zone of interest\" is a better expression of that concept, it seems to me, than \"reasonable interest.\" I mean ­­ you know, that's my objection to the reasonable interest test.",
  "That may be better ­­",
  "\"Arguably\" could refer to factual matters; that is, you ­­ you are within the zone of interest if certain facts are established. And, if you don't establish those facts, you are not. That's how I've always understood the \"arguably.\" I don't think it means ­­ you know, \"close enough for government work.\" It doesn't mean that.

  "Are there no sanctions for trespassing upon Federal property that is not a military base?",

  "Including by issuing debarment orders. He has no authority to do that, does he?",
  "But that's not Respondent's theory here.",
  "It was not argued in that case that the statute didn't apply, and that's what you're arguing here.",
  "You keep sliding into the First Amendment issue, which is not the issue on which we granted certiorari. We're only interested in whether the statute applies.",
  "You can raise it, but we don't have to listen to it.",
  "That's ­­ that's what I'm saying.",
  "They don't say control begins at the green line. To the contrary, they say they have control over the whole installation. Do you deny that, that the ­­ that the commanding officer has the right to control the entire installation?",
  "Because ­­ because the commanding officer agreed to that, because that's the term of the ­­ of the easement.",
  "There may well be, but is there ­­ is there a difference in the authority of the commanding officer? That's what's crucial.",
  "They're entitled to have it both ways. It's their base. And if that's the deal ­­ you know, take it or leave it, State. We ­­ we'll give you this easement, but the ­­ the terms are what we have said. What's wrong with that?",
  "But if ­­ if your colleague is correct, that the green line marked the edge of the easement, it would be entirely proper not to ­­ not to arrest him for violating the base until he left the easement; that is, when he crossed the green line. It has nothing to do with the ­­ the commanding officer saying this is the only part of the installation that we care about.",
  "It marks the end of the easement.",
  "So we're back to the real estate test. I ­­ I thought that you were not relying on the ­­ on the exclusive ownership test. You are?",
  "Oh, okay.",
  "So you're defending the Ninth Circuit's?",
  "Excuse me. What about the portion of the base on the other side of the road easement, where the government does have exclusive possession?",
  "Is that okay? That's still part of the base.",
  "Yes or no, under your theory?",
  "That may be very bad, but is it bad because the government does not have exclusive possession of every ­­",
  "You know, when you talk about the road, they've given an easement, so you can say, oh, yeah, they don't have exclusive possession. But the other side of the road, that vast tract, you are saying the government, what, does or does not have exclusive possession?",
  "Then the word \"possession\" means nothing. You are ­­ you are applying solely a functional test. It only possesses that which it is using for military purposes. That is not a possession test. It's a purely functional test.",
  "It seems to me a First Amendment argument and not an argument that goes to the scope of Section 1382.",
  "So you are saying we should read the statute to say it only applies when it doesn't violate the First Amendment. Of course, we'd read it that way.",
  "But not because it has anything to do with the scope of authority of the government. It's what the government can do. I ­­ I don't know how to read that ­­ that text, in such a way that it will avoid all First Amendment problems. There is no way to do that.",
  "I'm ­­ I'm not sure it ­­ you said it is conceded that ­­ that those things should have been brought to the airline's attention. Has that been conceded? I'm not sure.",
  "I think ­­ I think they said if it ­­ if they were brought, they should have been brought in a different fashion, but I'm not ­­ I'm not sure they ­­ they have conceded that.",
  "Well, you could convey anything justifiably, sure, I agree with that.",
  "But does defamatory require that it be materially false? Can't I defame somebody with a statement in ­­ in which the derogatory information is not material to anything at all, but it's just derogatory?",
  "Has to be materially false to sustain what?",
  "But it would still support a defamation, wouldn't it?",
  "Because it is material to the person's reputation.",
  "Yes, you could say he's nuts, but the question isn't whether somebody would say it. The question is whether that is false. I mean, the mere fact that ­­ that a lot of people will ­­ will exaggerate and say things that are simply not true doesn't make it okay.",
  "But the point is that somebody ought to determine whether the exaggeration or whatever it was, was material, whether ­­ whether it would have made any difference to TSA if it had been described otherwise. And in this case, as I understand it, as ­­ as the Colorado supreme court said, nobody has made that determination; right? The Colorado supreme court says it doesn't make any difference whether ­­ whether it would have affected TSA or not, putting it ­­ putting it the proper way, right?",
  "So that's what we're confronted with, simply, the ­­ the need for somebody to make that factual determination, right? And you're saying what? There's no need to make it at all?",
  "There are two ­­ there are two different issues of falsity that we're talking about here, of materiality. One is the defamation issue, and it is material to say that somebody is mentally unstable when all that he did was lose his temper. Okay? That's my view of it. That does not answer the question of whether calling him mentally unstable, instead of he lost his temper or just saying he lost his temper, would have produced the same effect with the airlines, whether the airlines, even if he had said, well, he lost his temper, he's been fired from his job, he may have a ­­ he may have a gun, whether that alone, without saying he was mentally unstable, would have induced the airline to take him off the flight. There are two different questions. Materiality for defamation is ­­ is quite different from the materiality for purposes of obtaining the immunity under this Act. The latter question is for the court, but the former is for the jury, it seems to me.",
  "You'd give the jury two different instructions? You are to find materiality for purposes of whether it's defamatory or not and then, having found that it is defamatory, you must make a second materiality finding, namely, would this defamatory statement have caused TSA ­­ if it had been accurate, would TSA not have taken the action that it did, not have removed this man from the flight? You're going to give the jury those two instructions on materiality?",
  "And you'd ­­ you'd feel snug and comfortable in making reports to airlines, knowing that whether you're going to be held liable is going to be up to some jury who is going to see that this person, his career was ruined, and it's going to be up to the jury to say whether he can recover or not?",
  "That doesn't give me a lot ­­ a lot of comfort. If you're really concerned about enabling people to come forward without fear, when they have a suspicion of something, I'm saying, well ­­ you know, some jury will decide whether ­­ whether you put it wrongly or not, and if you're putting it wrongly, it would have made a difference, it doesn't make me happy.",
  "Where are you reading?",
  "I wrote it. I don't think that's what I meant.",
  "It would be a strange ­­ strange thing to worry about, it seems to me. It's a fairly infrequent situation, isn't it?",
  "Mr. Feldman, what about ­­ what about a statute that says the plaintiff shall recover, as part of his damages, attorneys' fees? What do we do with that, for purposes of 1291?",
  "Absolutely clearly?",
  "So it is clear, is it not, that the criterion is not whether it is part of damages?",
  "Because, if that were the criterion, Budinich would have come out the other way.",
  "Essentially, it doesn't matter whether it's merits or nonmerits.",
  "For purposes of ­­ for purposes of this rule.",
  "I don't know how else you can read it.",
  "\"As a general matter.\" But ­­ but the case acknowledges that that's not always true, and the holding says it doesn't matter when it's not true, they will still be treated as ­­ as separate, even though they are damages, we're not going to treat them as damages.",
  "Yes, but Budinich acknowledged that some of these fees are not costs. It acknowledged that.",
  "I don't understand the difference between \"deeming\" and \"being.\" When the statute deems it to be costs, they are costs. They are costs.",
  "But we said in Budinich that they are costs, even when the statute makes clear that they are damages. I mean, we're saying it doesn't matter what the statute says, and I don't see why it should matter what the contract says.",
  "I don't want to have to go through this in every case.",
  "Okay. So limit it to attorneys' fees, as the rule does. That's a pretty clear line. Attorneys' fees ­­ you know, you ­­ you have to file right away. Anything else, it can extend.",
  "I don't care about this case, frankly. I care about the rule that we're going to be adopting.",
  "I wouldn't be saying that. I would be saying there's attorneys' fees and there's stuff other than attorneys' fees. Merits doesn't matter.",
  "Well, if they're worried about it, they could always appeal and withdraw the appeal later.",
  "If they ­­ if they don't get the amount, right?",
  "Are you ­­ are you sure that, as a general matter, contractual provisions do not make attorneys' fees costs? I've seen a lot of contracts that say ­­ you know, shall recover costs including ­­ including attorneys' fees.",
  "Of course, those ­­ those savings would ­­ would not be evenly distributed among the upwind States, right? So some upwind States that are able to make those efficient changes will be carrying more than their burden of reducing the emissions that affect downwind States, right?",
  "Well, I don't mind a State doing less. I think North Carolina said ­­ said that you can use those cost figures to do less, and that's not challenged here. But what the application of the cost factor means is that some States that can more efficiently make the changes will be required to do more than merely account for their proportion of the downwind harm. Isn't that true?",
  "Yes or no? I mean, I think it's an easy yes or no answer.",
  "Have you answered my question? Does ­­ does the fact that you begin with ­­ what the statute says is that each upwind State has to account for its ­­ its effect on the downwind States, but once having identified that effect, you ­­ you then say those upwind States that can make the reductions more efficiently have to make more reductions than they ­­ than their mere proportion of the harm requires. Isn't that so?",
  "And what provision of the statute allows you to take that into account?",
  "I mean, as opposed to each State, whether it's inefficient or efficient, has to merely reduce its contribution to the downwind State pollution, right? That's what the statute says.",
  "The problem is that that allocation among different actors is done State by State, and simply taking costs into account as determining who will do what simply eliminates the ­­ the requirement that each State not be ­­ not be required to do more than its share of the pollution it's ­­ it's causing downstream. It's the State­by­State requirement that makes it very difficult to think that all Congress wanted was the most efficient reduction of pollution, no matter where that pollution came from. That's simply not what the statute envisions.",
  "And maybe that'd be a better statute. Maybe it shouldn't be State by State.",
  "If Congress wanted that, why couldn't Congress simply have said, the EPA shall prescribe minimum pollution reduction measures that have to be taken by the States? That's a quite different statute from what we have before us. But what you're saying is ­­ you know, you ­­ you reduce it this ­­ this much, as much as efficiency will allow, or else, you're in violation of ­­ of the good neighbor rule. And that's a very different statute from what Congress wrote. Maybe it's a good idea. Maybe EPA ought to control all ­­ all efficiency measures for reducing pollution, but it's certainly not the statute that Congress wrote.",
  "Excuse me. I don't understand that. Please say that again.",
  "Oh, but that's crucial. I mean, it would have no idea whether EPA would use any or would pick $500 or would pick whatever. I mean, I don't know how it could sensibly design a ­­ a program without knowing that.",
  "Can you give us an example of when EPA has done this in the past, where a ­­ a crucial element of a ­­ of a NAAQS has not been defined by the agency, and yet, the agency, nonetheless, requires the States to ­­ to put together their SIPs without knowing what their target is? And that's the problem here. What's your best example of another case in which the agency said, you ­­ you put together a SIP, and we're not going to tell you what the target is.",
  "Well, that just means it's pin the tail on the donkey. Some States got the tail. I mean ­­ you know, they pinned it in the right place. That doesn't prove anything. I want an example of another instance in which EPA has ­­ has hidden the ball, has said, we're not going to tell you what the target is, it's up to you to come up ­­ up with a SIP, and we'll tell you after the fact whether that SIP happened to meet the target that we've invented.",
  "All right. All right.",
  "Okay.",
  "Yes. That just means there's some facts that they don't know. Of course, there are always going to be uncertainty about certain facts. But here, there is uncertainty about the target, not just about the facts. We don't know what target we're expected to hit.",
  "I suppose you could average them out, couldn't you?",
  "I don't think that's any more irrational then picking a number like 500 bucks as ­­ as to ­­ you know, what the ­­ who can do it more efficiently. That's sort of arbitrary.",
  "I understand that, but my point is that is certainly a pretty ­­ pretty arbitrary number, and ­­ and I think averaging for all the receptors is certainly no more arbitrary.",
  "Can I ask, until you propose your SIP to replace the FIP, right, the FIP remains in effect?",
  "And you're bound by that until they approve your new SIP. How long does such a transaction normally take?",
  "You think that's a quick process? I mean, as soon as ­­",
  "If you'll have to develop a new SIP, that'll take you some time?",
  "And then that SIP is ­­ is submitted to EPA, and ­­ and they chew on it for as long as they want, right?",
  "And then maybe they will say, your SIP is good enough, and maybe they won't.",
  "And that means the statute doesn't require you to do that, I assume.",
  "I mean, when they say that, that ­­ that's an affirmation by them that the statute does not require you to do it, I assume. Is that your point?",
  "Well, they have done the impossible here, haven't they? I mean, they have the transport rule. The only question is whether it should have come out sooner or later, right? The only question is whether it should have come out before the States were obliged to submit their SIPs.",
  "You started to give us a second statutory reason. I was really eager to see what that was.",
  "Would you finish describing the issue? I really didn't hear it.",
  "Well, I think ­­ I think it would follow that if you did it for good cause to ­­ to apply the rule, you can do it for good cause to abolish it, not that you can do it by rulemaking when you adopt it and then used good cause when you ­­ when you abolish it. It would seem, to me, to square with the text.",
  "\"In the same manner\"?",
  "Amounts significantly attribute, right? It's ­­ it's amounts.",
  "Yes, yes. Not conducts significantly.",
  "It isn't contributions to nonattainment. It's the word \"amounts.\" The statute prohibits activity within the State from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will contribute significantly.",
  "Okay. Amounts are amounts. I mean, it doesn't ­­",
  "That's my point exactly.",
  "But the basketball thing is ­­ to make it parallel to what's at issue here, the question you should ask the coach, which ­­ which of the ­­ you lost 101 to 100. Which of the 101 points contributed most to your loss?",
  "It's ­­ it's the one that was the layup. I mean, he would not answer the one that was the layup. He'd say what do you mean? All ­­ all of the 101.",
  "What's F4? What's F4?",
  "For those of us who don't deal with this as much as you do.",
  "Okay.",
  "You do give the subsets. It's not just the general, is it?",
  "Do you mean we can't correct congressional mistakes?",
  "But under ­­ under her theory, the ­­ the petition is ­­ is still coming from the same person. Under yours, it would be coming from a different person. How can you ­­ how can you even know that that person now wants this ­­ this ­­ this new adult to come in, much less go ahead without a petition from that person?",
  "You’re going to file a petition in that person's name, without that person's consent?",
  "And you're saying that this automatically gives the consent of that parent?",
  "Well, you must be if it can automatically convert.",
  "If I understand you, the ­­ the parent will be deemed to have filed a petition for admission of this now­adult, right?",
  "And ­­ but the parent can withdraw that petition?",
  "All of this flows from the word \"automatic\"?",
  "Well, this is all upside down. I thought it's the Agency that we deferred to. If it can be read in the way the Agency wants, we affirm the Agency's position.",
  "You're saying that that's not true, that if it can be read the way the court of appeals would like it to be read, we must affirm the court of appeals on it.",
  "It sure is. I never heard ­­",
  "I never heard of that proposition.",
  "That would depend entirely upon how much weight you want to give to the word \"automatically.\" I frankly find it hard to think that all the things that you say are going to happen flow from the word \"automatic.\" And once you have a more narrow view of automatically, it isn't ­­ your holistic argument does not carry the day, and you're left with an ambiguity that, it seems to me, we would defer to the Agency on, not ­­ not to the Ninth Circuit.",
  "How can you possibly qualify for B, without qualifying for A? How can you retain your original priority if you have not been converted to another category?",
  "That's quite impossible. The two are obviously conjunctive and not dysjunctive.",
  "Well, all that proves is that you need either automatic conversion or the filing of a separate petition. But you obviously need either one or the other of those two ­­",
  "­­ before the ­­ the B part, \"the alien shall retain the original priority,\" makes any sense.",
  "Under Federal law, you don't think the judge could say, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this defendant has already pleaded guilty to a horrible crime. This is a punishment hearing. He has chosen not to ­­ not to testify in this ­­ in this hearing. You ­­ you are ­­ if you wish, you may take his failure to testify as an indication that he does not have remorse, that he is not sorry. He could have come before you said and, said I am terribly sorry, I wish I had never done it, I will never do it again. He has chosen not to testify. You may, if you wish, take that into account in determining whether ­­ whether there is remorse. You can't say that.",
  "Well, then, your answer should have been otherwise.",
  "Of course.",
  "In this case, of course, the question is even narrower. That instruction would forbid the jury from even taking into account his failure to testify on ­­ on the one factor of remorse ­­ the one psychological factor of remorse. And if you say that you're not entitled to such an instruction on that, that alone would have ­­ would have been enough to deny the requested instruction.",
  "They also weren't instructed to draw any inferences, were they?",
  "I mean, the ­­ the issue here is whether you must instruct them not to draw inferences, not ­­ not whether ­­ whether ­­ anyway.",
  "It doesn't demonstrate anything of the sort. It just means that he didn't object.",
  "Maybe he was a very bad lawyer. Who knows? We're ­­ we're going to determine our law on the basis of whether a government lawyer made an objection or not?",
  "At most, it shows that he didn't think that there was anything wrong with it. Does that mean we have to think there was nothing wrong with it?",
  "Okay.",
  "He's trying to help you, counsel.",
  "What about remorse? Wasn't remorse at issue?",
  "Well, whatever. I mean, the jury doesn't have to take that into account. Isn't it one of ­­ one of the factors?",
  "Right.",
  "It is, but you have to go beyond saying I believe that. What you have to say to prevail here is, not only do I believe it, but no reasonable juror ­­ no reasonable jurist could possibly believe otherwise. Now, do you want to say that?",
  "No reasonable jurors could say otherwise?",
  "And you think that made the difference, that the jury would not have condemned your client to death, had it not been for the fact that they drew an adverse inference from ­­ they knew all the horrific details of the crime. They had heard all of your mitigating evidence. And you think what ­­ what tipped the balance ­­ or at least we think it plausibly could have tipped the balance, is ­­ is this failure to give the no­adverse inference instruction?",
  "Really?",
  "Well, what ­­",
  "Where is it in the materials?",
  "Article 13, which you're referring to.",
  "I'd like to read it.",
  "Well, which of the articles ­­ which of the provisions in Article 13 would ­­ would prevent the return in the hypothetical that Justice Alito just gave you?",
  "I mean, what ­­ what does Article 13 allow the court to consider? It says, \"It's not bound to order the return if the person, institution, or other body having care of the person of the child was not actually exercising the custody rights at the time of removal or retention.\" Well, you know ­­",
  "That wouldn't have ­­ or had consent to or ­­ that wouldn't apply in his hypothetical or in this case.",
  "B, \"There is grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm.\" I mean, we have no reason to believe that ­­ that your client would ­­ would harm the child or ­­ or that the parent in Justice Alito's hypothetical would harm the child, \"or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.\" I don't see how any of those things would ­­ would come to the assistance of the child in ­­ in Justice Alito's hypothetical.",
  "Physical or psychological harm.",
  "It might be now and then, but in the routine case that Justice Alito just gave you, I don't see how there's any ­­ any reason at all not to yank the child back from wherever he's been for 10 years.",
  "Yes, but Article 13 does not say the child ­­ the child can state ­­ well, let's see. \"The child objects to being returned.\" I guess you could limit to that. \"May also refuse to order the return of the child if it finds that the child objects to being returned.\"",
  "So that's the one exception, yes.",
  "But they may be wrong. Who cares if they're wrong? The point is a treaty should be interpreted uniformly by all the parties to it. And you're telling me, well, all the rest of them interpret it another way, but they're wrong ­­ you know, everybody is out of step, but me. That's ­­ that's just not right.",
  "None of that is covered by the treaty. Yes, each State may apply its own law with respect to matters not covered by the treaty, but I do not read that to say ­­ to mean that each State may apply its own law in interpreting the provisions of the treaty and so can create exceptions on the basis of equitable discretion when the treaty has none or because its courts use that in another ­­ in other contexts or create an exception on the basis of equitable tolling. This is a matter of interpreting the treaty, not of bringing into effect some other principle of ­­ of State law that overrides the treaty. That's how I read that provision.",
  "I think they had it in mind, not just the interest of children, but the interest of parents. It's simply not true that, in all cases involving children, the paramount interest of the child governs. That's not the case, or else, we would remove many children from their parents in this country.",
  "Parents have rights.",
  "And that is one of the things that this treaty considers.",
  "Justice Sotomayor is from New York.",
  "I think your answer to Justice Kagan's question has to be no, or else I don't understand what we're doing here.",
  "But you say ­­ I don't understand what you're saying. Give us an example.",
  "You just don't want to say no. It seems to me your case requires you to say no, and it's no help to me to say, well ­­ you know, there may be some exceptions that I can't describe. Tell me the exceptions if there are any.",
  "Yes.",
  "Under 13, right? Is that the discretion you're talking about?",
  "And I ­­ I assumed from your brief that that was not the reading you were giving it. And that is not the reading it has to be given, frankly. I read it the other way, \"shall order the return unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled.\" I assume that to mean in which case you shall not order the return. Isn't that the way you've been reading it?",
  "Oh, it is not. Okay. Well, then, gee, we don't have a lot to argue about here.",
  "Of course.",
  "Ms. Moskowitz, what do you do about Article 13 in that case, which begins, \"notwithstanding the provisions of\" Article ­­ \"of the preceding Article 12, the judicial or administrative authority requesting is not bound to order the return of the child if the person\" ­­ blah, blah, blah. That says to me that, under 12, you are bound, and you're telling me, well, you're really not bound under 12. You have discretion anyway.",
  "I, frankly, didn't understand that that was your argument in this case, and it ­­ it puts the whole case in a quite different light.",
  "What's the government's position on ­­ on this question we've just been discussing, whether Article 12 is absolute or whether there is discretion even within Article 12, even though specific elements of discretion are contained in Article 13?",
  "Why doesn't the context include Section 13, which ­­ which lists specific reasons why you can depart from 12? I mean, it seems very strange to say, and in addition to that, there's a whole pot load of other reasons within ­­ within 12 itself.",
  "You would expect all the signatories to this treaty to come up with essentially the same exceptions, under ­­ under what you say is ­­ is the interpretation of Article 12?",
  "I mean, it seems to me it just makes that article impossible to apply consistently country to country.",
  "Have they exercised it ­­ have they exercised it, that discretion which they say is there?",
  "Have they exercised that discretion not to apply the ­­ the mandatory requirement of Article 12?",
  "I'm talking about foreign courts.",
  "There's always ­­ isn't there always abduction? As your friend has pointed out, the whole treaty only applies where the child has been abducted, so you say, oh, well, there's a special exception to the rules of the treaty where the child has been abducted, but that's what the treaty applies to.",
  "You know, I have one more question. At the end of the day, now that I understand the government's position, I don't see any difference between your position and ­­ and the position of ­­ of the Petitioner here, except that he wants to call it equitable tolling, and you want to say we can take concealment into account under Section 12 ­­",
  "­­ and not apply the absolute rule, where there's been concealment. I don't care whether you call it equitable tolling or not.",
  "Well, surely, you would ­­ you would argue the de facto officer doctrine.",
  "Of course, you would.",
  "And we've applied that in innumerable cases. You don't really think we're going to go back and rip out every decision made.",
  "You started off by saying ­­ you know, it would ­­ it would repudiate so many actions that have been taken. I have a very, very stark question: Suppose I agree with the court of appeals that the only ­­ the only interpretation of ­­ of the Constitution is that the vacancy must have arisen during the recess, just by hypothesis. I agree with that, okay? What do you do when there is a practice that ­­ that flatly contradicts a clear text of the Constitution? Which ­­ which of the two prevails?",
  "So if you ignore the Constitution ­­",
  "­­ often enough, its meaning changes?",
  "Now, you're ­­ you're questioning my hypothesis. You have to accept my hypothesis.",
  "Let's assume that the text is clearly against you. Should I say, oh, yes, it ­­ it says something else, but the practice for over 200 years has been something different, and it's the practice that must prevail.",
  "Yes or no?",
  "Does the practice prevail over the clear text ­­",
  "You're questioning my ­­ my hypothesis again.",
  "I am assuming a clear text of the Constitution and a practice that is ­­ is contrary to it.",
  "You do not want to answer my hypothesis.",
  "Well, let's ­­ let's talk about your 1948 emergencyof the Secretary of Labor. There was a vacancy in ­­ in that post. The President has the authority to convene Congress. And whatever was the case in 1948 or ­­ or in 1789, Congress can be back here in one day. Article II, Section 3 says, \"He may, on extraordinary occasions, convene both houses.\"",
  "So what's the problem? If there is indeed this ­­ you know, this terrible emergency you're talking about, the President has the power to call them back.",
  "Yes, but my only point is what ­­ what the recess appointment power consists of cannot be determined on the basis that, well, there are going to be terrible emergencies, so it must enable the President to do this or that. Extraordinary emergencies are handled in the Constitution. You don't have to expand the ­­ the vacancy appointment power in order to handle those.",
  "It’s been assumed to be ­­ it's been assumed to be ambiguous by self­interested Presidents.",
  "Of course. Death is an enduring state. But if someone dies in 1941, you don't say he died in 1945. He's still dead.",
  "But his death happened in 1941.",
  "The two examples that Justice Breyer gives are examples where we gave it a meaning that was different from what it said.",
  "We don't have a case involving this particular issue yet.",
  "I ­­ I think \"happens\" continues to mean \"chances to be.\" We still use it that way. But we only use it that way when it is followed by an infinitive. \"I happened to see him,\" it means a chance that I saw him. Or ­­ you know, 9/11, the destruction of the Twin Towers happened to occur on 9/11. But you wouldn't say ­­ you wouldn't say it happened on ­­ on 9/13, simply because it continued to be destroyed. I don't know what the OED examples that Justice Kagan referred to were, but I bet they ­­ they used \"happen\" followed by an infinitive, and I think we still use it that way.",
  "Well, that was that Senate. I mean, that's not the Senate that is sitting now. You are attributing the views of one Senate to the Senate over ­­ over time.",
  "Excuse me. Will you crank up your ­­ your thing? I can't you hear well enough. That's good.",
  "Counsel, you are not reading this, are you?",
  "Oh, that's nice. Do you know of any other real estate thing which says it's an easement for one purpose and the fee for another? The government absolutely denied in Great Northern, didn't it? It was ­­ that was the government's case; this was not a fee.",
  "They didn't say it's a ­­ you know, for some purposes it is. They said it was not a fee. And that's what the Court held, contrary ­­ in accordance with what the government wanted, right?",
  "And that case has been around for how long?",
  "Okay. And the case explicitly says it's an easement. And people have been buying and selling real estate I assume in reliance on that case for ­­ for that entire period of time. And now the government has this new theory that for some purposes it's a fee; for some purposes it's an easement. That's not what Great Northern said.",
  "I assume your answer would be that if it's a choice between disappointing people who properly relied on the law, and disappointing people who were ­­ were not following the law, it's clear who should ­­ who should take it in the neck. It's the latter, isn't it?",
  "I don't understand how that can be, and yet, the government can argue contrary to what the government says. I mean, is that what you are telling us?",
  "The Interior says one thing and the Justice Department here says something else? I mean, we have a president who reconciles these two things. He must agree with one or the other.",
  "I'm sure the government will have an explanation as to why we shouldn't.",
  "Wait, wait. Before you go, you really think the Court was saying, It will be an easement when that suits the government, but it will be something else when that suits the government?",
  "I mean, it's either an easement or it's not an easement. You really think the ­­ the opinion meant to reserve the question whether it was an easement.",
  "Did they give compensation to the people ­­",
  "­­ to whom they pronounced that?",
  "That can't change the meaning of the 1875 Act.",
  "It reflects a later Congress's understanding of what an earlier Congress did. We don't ­­",
  "­­ interpret statutes on the basis of what later Congresses think they meant.",
  "People have done it.",

  "­­ what a spaghetti strip of land through ­­",
  "Yes, but you should ­­ should know how much land the United States owns. It's ­­ it's incredible that ­­ that there's no record in the Interior Department or anywhere else of what land the United States own. You claim you own these thousands of acres, and you say we've not kept track of it. We just know where it's going to go, but we don't know what we own.",
  "Have you even heard of the term \"limited fee\" until this case? I never heard it.",
  "A. James Casner didn't talk to me about limited fee.",
  "Which is where? Where are you reading?",
  "I don't know why it wasn't in your brief.",
  "What is the ambiguity we are talking about?",
  "What is the non­ambiguity we are talking about?",
  "If ­­ if ­­ if we believe that the word \"determine\" means make a final judgment, which you assert it means, so that there's no ambiguity, it seems to me you have a statute in which the bankruptcy judge is only authorized to make recommendations in some situations and to make final judgments in others. And surely, there's a problem with a district judge altering that disposition ­­",
  "­­ by just saying, oh, I know you're supposed to make a final determination, but just for fun, give me your recommendation. I mean, that is just contrary to the statute.",
  "Congress might have ­­ might have provided that if it had known about Stern, right?",
  "But do we sit here to write the statutes that Congress would have written ­­",
  "­­ if they knew about some future events? I don't think so.",
  "Counsel, is Article III not violated so long as the parties are happy?",
  "Can the parties agree to have a ­­ an Article III court decide a case it has no jurisdiction to decide, and so long as no harm is done to the parties, it's okay?",
  "You're confusing me. I thought you ­­ you did say that there can't be implied consent or even express consent to what happened here. Isn't that your position?",
  "Express or implied.",
  "I thought that's what ­­",
  "So you ­­ you read me ­­ want me to read that ­­ that when a district judge refers the matter to a bankruptcy judge to hear and determine and to enter an appropriate order, the bankruptcy judge can say, you know, I'm just too busy.",
  "I'm on Easter vacation and I may hear and determine it, and I may enter appropriate orders, but I don't feel like it.",
  "It doesn't say that it may refer. It says, \"bankruptcy judges may hear and determine.\"",
  "How do you bring the \"may\" over to the district court?",
  "Then then the \"may\" that you're concerned with is the \"may\" in (a), not the \"may\" in (b).",
  "And what the other side says is that's very nice, but that's not what the statute says. The statute does not give the bankruptcy court the authority to enter a ­­ a simply recommendation for what has been defined as a core proceeding. For core proceedings, what the statute says is you'll ­­ is you'll determine it. And you're saying, well, it says that, but since it's been held unconstitutional, we're going to shift this over to the ­­ to the category in which they ­­ they can issue an order and recommendation. Where does that come from?",
  "No, that's not my problem. My problem is ­­ is not why they don't have to enter an order and judgment. My problem is why they are authorized to issue a recommendation.",
  "Where does that come from? They're not issued ­­ they're not authorized to issue recommendations for core proceedings.",
  "Oh, really? I mean, can a district judge sort of ­­ you know, it's not terribly important because it's just a recommendation. So I'm going to refer it to my former partner, you know, my former law partner.",
  "Yes, even with the consent of the parties.",
  "To a special master.",
  "But it has statutory authority to do that. There is no statutory authority here to refer a matter to a bankruptcy judge for nothing other than a recommendation, except for noncore matters.",
  "So it can do that for core ­­ for those core proceedings that were not held unconstitutional under Stern, right?",
  "It can just refer them and say just give me the eggs.",
  "I don't need the bacon.",
  "You don't have to determine it; just give me your recommendation.",
  "It seems to me the dichotomy set forth in the statute disappears once you say \"hear and determine\" means either \"hear and determine\" or \"hear or determine.\"",
  "The whole dichotomy of the statute disappears.",
  "I want to go back to your statement that the district court here has both original and appellate jurisdiction because it can recall the reference to the bankruptcy judge. Can it recall the reference after the bankruptcy judge has issued his decision in the case?",
  "Has entered a judgment in the case?",
  "They didn't say that it's okay without consent.",
  "They just say it is okay with consent. They didn't address the point.",
  "What are you saying, \"SUB payments\"?",
  "I'm not hip.",
  "Why are they giving them the money, just out of love? I mean, they don't give it to me when I retire. They only give it to their employees when they retire. What ­­ what are they paying them for? Aren't they paying them for faithful and good past services?",
  "No, they are ­­ they are just being generous?",
  "Why don't they do that for me?",
  "Was the earlier statute definition of wages for tax purposes, was that reenacted at the same time?",
  "So you really have ­­ you call into play the principle that you should interpret a statute to make sense and not interpret any provision to be superfluous, right?",
  "And you say that the government's interpretation renders (o) superfluous.",
  "We'll ask him about that.",
  "You have to acknowledge, though, that if you read ­­ if you read the two sections of the statute together, the one seems to be unnecessary.",
  "\"Wages\" means all remuneration, including cash value of all remuneration, including benefits. And then (o) says \"extension of withholding of certain payments other than wages. For purposes of this chapter, any supplemental and unemployment compensation benefit paid to an individual shall be treated as if it were a payment of wages,\" suggesting that it really isn't.",
  "I mean, there would have been a way to fix the revenue rulings without doing it this way. Couldn't they have done it some other way without enacting a statute that contradicted itself?",
  "Yes, unless it was in a section that said how to treat men who are not 6 feet tall. The title of this section (o), \"extension of withholding to certain payments other than wages.\"",
  "I mean, it ­­ it clearly suggests that these are not wages.",
  "Right.",
  "You know, I should probably ask this of the other side, and I will, but do you happen to know when was the last time that Massachusetts prosecuted somebody for obstructing entrance to an abortion clinic?",
  "So there have been laws against obstruction during this entire period, right?",
  "And you say that only once, in 1997, that was the last time a prosecution was brought.",
  "In Schneider, they were held not so far back that their shouts and protests couldn't be heard. Isn't that the case? They could still be heard ­­",
  "­­ they were not out of earsight ­­",
  "Counsel, do you accept that the record here shows that it did not work well in the sense that Justice Breyer ­­",
  "­­ seems to use it?",
  "As I recall the record, all ­­ all it says is that the police found it difficult to apply a bubble; that ­­ you know, they have to measure 8 feet or whatever it is. They didn't say that massive obstruction and protests are occurring, preventing people from ­­ that wasn't the finding, was it?",
  "And if you know they're going to the clinic.",
  "It is the case, isn't it, that not only abortion counselors are ­­ are excluded from this area, everybody is, right? Anybody who wants to talk to anybody or who just wants to be there ­­",
  "­­ can't ­­ I mean, this is a ­­ a dead speech zone, right?",
  "Excuse me. If ­­ if you're going through the zone just to get somewhere, not to get to the clinic, and you're walking with a companion, can't you speak to your companion as you walk ­­ it doesn't ban speech by everybody who's walking through.",
  "This is not a protest case. These people don't want to protest abortion. They want to talk to the women who are about to get abortions and try to talk them out of it. I ­­ I think it ­­ it distorts it to say that what they want to do is protest abortion. If it was a protest, keeping them back 35 feet might not be so bad. They can scream and yell and hold up signs from 35 feet. But what they can't do is try to talk the woman out of the abortion. It's a counseling case, not a ­­ not a protest case.",
  "Well, surely you could have a law against screaming and shouting within 35 feet or protesting within 35 feet. Isn't that more narrowly tailored? I mean, what this case involves, what these people want to do is to speak quietly and in a friendly manner, not in a hostile manner, because that would ­­ that would frustrate their purpose, with the people going into the clinic.",
  "You should say yes.",
  "I don't understand it. It's a permissible purpose to say this is a safe facility, but not a permissible purpose to say this is an unsafe facility?",
  "Is that ­­",
  "I ­­ I object to you calling these people protestors, which you've been doing here during the whole presentation. That is not how they present themselves. They do not say they want to make protests. They say they want to talk quietly to the women who are going into these facilities. Now how does that make them protestors?",
  "This is testimony by the ­­ by the clinics themselves, right?",
  "What's the alternative here?",
  "Standing 35 feet away and yelling?",
  "Is that the alternative?",
  "To comfort these women?",
  "They don't know who's going into the clinic.",
  "Until you get to the area close to the clinic, you don't know whether passersby are going there or not.",
  "Are threats of violence domestic violence?",
  "I hope not. I hope not.",
  "Do we have to think that domestic violence is different from violence? Wouldn't the simple term \"violence,\" without the \"domestic\" adjective cover any physical abuse that causes harm?",
  "If I punch somebody in the nose, is that violence?",
  "If I punch somebody in the nose.",
  "Okay. So do you have to have a special rule for if I punch my wife in the nose?",
  "Any physical action that hurts somebody is violence, isn't it?",
  "Maybe I am missing something here, but I thought Justice Ginsburg's question was not addressed to the Federal statute, but to the Tennessee statute.",
  "And it's the Federal statute that uses physical force, right? What does the Tennessee statute say?",
  "Causing bodily injury.",
  "So your position is whenever ­­ whenever somebody is injured by reason of the intentional act of somebody else, that has been an application of violent force.",
  "Wait. Domestic strife? I mean, my goodness. All we have to find is domestic strife?",
  "Whenever there's domestic strife, guns are dangerous?",
  "Clearly, that's not what Congress had in mind.",
  "Okay.",
  "I don't know why you have to tie this to domestic ­­ domestic violence. Why do you ­­ it's no different from physical abuse of anybody else.",
  "Well, how many ­­ how many include? Just how many include mere touching as ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "What do you want us to do with those 14 that don't separate it out? And let's assume the case law doesn't ­­ what do you want us to do? Are they covered by this statute or not?",
  "Just touching. Just touching, is it ­­",
  "How do we get to the common law meaning of \"force\"? I mean, the statute does ­­ Federal statute doesn't say that, right? The Federal statute says convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, right?",
  "Yes, of course. In interpreting the meaning of a term in the definition, you take into account the term that that definition is defining. And in Johnson we did that, and we always ought to do it. And here the term that the definition which uses the term \"physical force\" is defining is \"domestic violence.\" And to give \"force\" in that context its common law meaning, which would include the mere touching, it seems to me is ­­ is an abuse of the principle that the defining term must be ­­ must be interpreted in the context of the term that is being defined.",
  "It distinguishes Johnson, but it doesn't get rid of the word \"violence,\" which is ­­ which is what is being defined.",
  "You are saying violence is being defined as a mere touching. I think that's a stretch.",
  "It wouldn't be the first mistake of course, right? It wouldn't be the first mistake Congress has made.",
  "Even if they wouldn't, once again, Congress may have miscalculated. It may have thought that this language, which it ­­ which intended, as you have described, would cover a lot of State statutes. And as it turns out, it didn't. And that wouldn't be the first congressional statute that didn't achieve what it thought it was going to achieve, right.",
  "So he was convicted of causing violent injury?",
  "So we sort of have two extreme positions here. The government is arguing that the statute covers mere touching. That's one extreme. And you're arguing that the statute doesn't cover all bodily injury, but only what, severe bodily injury?",
  "Why isn't there something in the middle? It doesn't cover touching but it covers bodily injury?",
  "Yes, but you would lose, right?",
  "Soap in the eyes.",
  "How about soap in the mouth? I've had that.",
  "Well, none of those things would be done intentionally, so they ­­ they don't scare me. But ­­ but I do think of a ­­ you know, a parent washing out a child's mouth with soap for ­­ for improper speech or a ­­ a mother pinching a child in ­­ you know, to bring the child under control in public. And that inflicts pain. It inflicts injury. And I worry about that being covered by ­­ by this Federal statute.",
  "But I ­­ really you have no answer to Johnson, except that ­­ that statement was dictum. And it was ­­ the case did not have to define the precise amount of injury necessary, right?",
  "I ­­ I assume that your point is it's a trap for the unwary, that ­­ that someone who has not really been guilty of violent action would not expect that he's covered by the ­­ by the prohibition on carrying a gun. He is not a violent person.",
  "Suppose you have a policeman who ­­ who is dissatisfied with his wages. So he makes an appointment with the commissioner ­­ police commissioner, and he goes in and grouses about his wages. He does this ­­ you know, 10 or 11 times. And the commissioner finally is fed up, and he tells his secretary, I don't ­­ I don't want to see this man again. Has he violated the Constitution?",
  "He has prevented a petition for a redress of grievances?",
  "I really don't understand that. When ­­ when you ­­ so what if it's 10 policemen who do this? It's still not a matter of public concern? Or does it have to be the whole police force?",
  "It seems to me it's always a matter of public concern, whether you're going to raise the salaries of policemen, whether it's an individual policeman asking for that or ­­ or a ­­ a combination of policemen or a union. It's always a matter of public concern, isn't it?",
  "Okay. To not ­­ not give this guy an appointment the 12th time.",
  "Well, how can he shut his door if ­­ he has a right to petition, a constitutional right to petition for the redress of grievances? His grievance is he's not being paid enough.",
  "But it's the same grievance if the union had presented it. The ­­ the grievance is the salaries for policemen are not high enough.",
  "He's not asking for just his salary to be raised. He wants salaries of all ­­ all the cops to be raised.",
  "Mr. Messenger, just to clarify what was the purpose of my earlier line of questioning, it was simply to show that, if you have a case, it doesn't rest on the right to petition the government for redress of grievances. It ­­ it rests on the First Amendment. You ­­ you say that there is being ­­ your ­­ your people are being required to support speech that they don't agree with.",
  "Now, that is ­­ you know, that is an arguable position, but I don't ­­ I don't think it's even arguable that the right to petition the government for redress of grievances is ­­ is involved here.",
  "That's a First Amendment violation, not a violation ­­ not a denial of the right to petition the government.",
  "What ­­ what was the question?",
  "I want to hear the answer, too, because, contrary to what Justice Kagan suggests, I ­­ I didn't say your First Amendment argument was valid.",
  "I said at least it was a comprehensible argument.",
  "Why isn't it? I mean, it is for private employers. There are some private employers who think they're better off with a closed shop, and they just want to deal with one union, and ­­ and they require all the people that they hire to become a member of this union and to pay union dues for representational purposes. They do this as private employers because they think it is in their interest as an employer. Why can't the government have the same interest?",
  "All right. But ­­ but don't tell me that there's no employer interest. There is an employer interest. You're just saying it is not ­­ it is not considerable enough, right?",
  "I suppose ­­ I suppose the fact that you're entitled to speak against abortion would not justify the government in requiring you to give money to Planned Parenthood?",
  "That's the argument you're making.",
  "Those things, you can argue, are not part of the representation for which they should be charged, and they should get their money back for those things, if they're actually not ­­ not getting any benefit from them.",
  "No, but they're ­­ I mean, what our cases say is you ­­ you can be compelled not to be a free rider, to ­­ to pay for those items of bargaining that benefit you, as well as everybody else. But you don't ­­ you don't have to pay for stuff that ­­ that is not within that description, stuff that doesn't benefit you at all.",
  "I don't understand what you're saying. If there were no union, there would be no wages?",
  "So from ­­ from the outset, it set up the union, right, and the union said, We want 7 bucks an hour, was that it?",
  "And who picked that number?",
  "The State did. Okay.",
  "Of course, one can be skeptical about whether ­­ when States do this, they are doing it because it's more ­­ more efficient as an employer because some States have tried to force private employers to have a closed shop, haven't they?",
  "And there's no ­­ you know, no State government interest in it. There's just State interest in unions.",
  "And unions getting a lot of money from people who don't belong in the unions. So one can be skeptical about whether this is really what's going on, that the State really thinks it's going to be a lot easier if it has a closed shop.",
  "They may do so because of that reason. You don't know what their reason is any more than I do. All you can say is that that might be their reason.",
  "But ­­ but it's only people who ­­ who disagree with the ­­ what the union's doing who could refuse to pay, you say? Right?",
  "Why can't people who ­­ who agree with the union just say, hey, I don't ­­ I don't have to pay, the union is going to do this stuff anyway, I'm going to ride for free, these other people are riding for free?",
  "Is there any ­­ is there any way to decide who's doing it just to save money and who's doing it on principle?",
  "So ­­ so you're essentially destroying not just the ­­ not just the ­­ the ­­ closed shop, but you're destroying the ability of the union to ­­ to get money even from the people who don't agree with what it's doing.",
  "Let's ­­ let's take your second point. What a statute of limitations says is not that you are ­­ are scot­free within the statute of limitations period. It simply is a negative. It says you can't be sued beyond that, right?",
  "So it seems to me there is nothing ­­ if ­­ if we adopted the position of the other side, there's nothing that would cause the statute of limitations to be frustrated.",
  "Yes, but it continued to be used in equity, even when there were limitations period, didn’t it? It may have started that way, but that was certainly not its only use.",
  "Well, it was Federal law. Federal law adopted it. It was Federal law.",
  "But they originated in equity, just as laches did. The tolling rules originated in equity. They were brought into law. What troubles me about this case is this: Did the adoption of the new Rules of Federal Procedure disable courts from bringing over anything else from equity into law? Tolling used to exist. It was brought over into law before the new Rules of Civil Procedure. And therefore, you would not be altering any substantive right to continue to apply that tolling rule. Your argument here is ­­ is that to apply laches is to alter a substantive right, and therefore, under the ­­ under the Rules Enabling Act is not allowable. My question is this: Do you think that the Rules Enabling Act prevented courts from doing what they had in the past? That is, not using the Act as the means of saying everything that was in equity is now in law, but rather sitting back and thinking ­­ you know, here's another part of equity that should be brought over into law, not because the Act says so, but because we think it ought to be, just as we thought, 50 years ago, the tolling ­­ the ­­ the tolling provision should be brought over into law. Have courts been ­­ been disabled from doing that by reason of the Act?",
  "But it says, \"The rules shall not alter or amend any substantive right.\" And what I'm saying is it isn't the rules that do it. It's just we have made the independent justification that this ancient rule, which was applied in equity, ought to be applied in law as well.",
  "Yeah, but the ­­ the mortgagor does ­­ does not invest substantial amounts of money the way MGM did here, on the assumption that, since suit hasn't been brought for 20 years, there's ­­ there's no valid claim. I mean, that's the difference in that situation. You're talking about inducing ­­ or causing at least, people who ­­ who proceed in good faith on the assumption that 20 years have gone by. Nobody ­­ nobody has questioned our doing it. They invest substantial amounts of money, and then, when that money starts to pay off, you file suit and ­­ and you get three years' worth of ­­ of their profits.",
  "Why can't we change our mind? Why can't we change our mind?",
  "And you say that none of the other instances in which we brought into law equitable doctrines, none of those were applied with respect to a prior enacted Federal statute? Is that your position?",
  "Well, I'll have to look it up.",
  "There was a long history that tolling didn't apply at law, and then we changed our mind.",
  "And you're saying we ­­ we never changed our mind where there was a statute of ­­ Federal statute of limitations? I ­­ I don't believe that.",
  "Could that equitable remedy overrule the statement that you're entitled to sue for all the profits within that 3­year period? You're saying the injunction can ­­ can, in effect, say you don't have to pay?",
  "Well, I understand that, but does the second eliminate the first? If it doesn't eliminate the first, Justice Breyer's point is absolutely correct.",
  "Excuse me. Congress cited what?",
  "Well, that may just mean ­­ you know, where it is a defense, it is an affirmative defense that has to be treated the way rule 8(c) says. I don't think that rule 8(c) establishes that it applies in law, as well as in equity, and that's the question I want to ask you. How ­­ do you ­­ do you say that ­­ that laches was a defense available at law before the Federal Rules were enacted? Or do you say that courts continue to have the power to bring it from equity into law after the rules were enacted? And if the latter, why so?",
  "They had ­­ they had been used in law before ­­ before the rules ­­",
  "Excuse me. Did not dispute what? What?",
  "Okay.",
  "But you've said ­­ I think you've said that ­­ that it would apply to ordinary statute of limitations. So if you have a six­year statute of limitations and you don't sue until five years after, you're subject to the defense, well, you should have ­­ should have sued sooner.",
  "I ­­ I share Justice Kagan's reservation about that. Could we limit our opinion just to rolling statutes?",
  "Throwing bombs doesn't count, but carrying a bomb does, is that it? Were they throwing bombs that they weren't carrying?",
  "And it was illegal.",
  "It was illegal.",
  "I'm ­­ I'm not sure he gets an A for consistency. I thought ­­ I thought you said you acknowledged or didn't repudiate the statement in ­­ in our opinion in J.L., that, if there was a bomb in the car, that would be something else. What ­­ what if there's in the car ­­ the tip is this person has an atomic bomb given him by Al Qaeda; he is driving it into the center of Los Angeles to ­­ to eradicate the entire city, okay? Let it go?",
  "He tells you the license number, where the car is. You can't stop the car?",
  "So you see, he's not consistent. I mean ­­",
  "It seems to me you're willing to accept our allowing ­­ or allowing the police to stop the car with the atom bomb and even allowing the police to stop the car with the kidnapped girl in the trunk. Once ­­ you know, once you give away those, we're just arguing about details, where you draw the line. Does ­­ does drunken driving fall on one side or the other of the line, and some of us may think drunken driving is ­­ is pretty serious and probably ­­ you know, as serious as having a kidnapped girl in the trunk.",
  "Okay. More than that, I want you to say the Court shouldn't. Let the car go. Bye­bye, Los Angeles.",
  "And I assume you would ­­ you would also say, to tie it into Justice Breyer's question, you would also say that that tip, \"Somebody ran me off the road,\" would not justify the court ­­ the police in stopping the car, just to make sure that this car was not the one that drove the guy off the road, right?",
  "Never mind drunkenness. The tip doesn't say anything about drunkenness. It just said, this car drove me off the road. You'd say the police could not follow that car, pull him over, and ­­ and ask did you ­­ did you drive somebody off the road?",
  "Following the car is going to do them no good as to whether he drove ­­ drove somebody off the road. They're not looking for a drunk. They're looking for somebody who drove somebody off the road, right?",
  "They could if the guy admitted it, you know.",
  "They could play Mutt and Jeff with him and he ­­ oh, yeah, I did, yes.",
  "But not necessarily drunkenness. I think there ­­ there are a lot of people that get tickets for reckless driving who have not served jail terms for driving drunk. The two are far from synonymous.",
  "And ­­ and between the, what, 50 and 75 percent, they've stopped people without just cause.",
  "Or they've ­­ they've troubled people who shouldn't have been troubled.",
  "Well, reckless driving always does, whether it ­­ whether it's the consequence of inebriation or not.",
  "So a simple call saying, boy, this guy ­­ you know, he cut in, in front of me. He's changing lanes too frequently ­­",
  "­­ that ­­ that enables the policeman, without observing any of that reckless driving, to stop the car further down the road.",
  "Of course, this call didn't say, I think the guy was drunk. It just said, somebody drove ­­ you know, drove me off the road.",
  "Right? So this isn't ­­ it isn't a call that says there's a drunken driver. It's just a call that says somebody drove irresponsibly, right? And that's enough to stop them.",
  "Okay. Really irresponsibly, okay?",
  "Really irresponsibly.",
  "It wasn't a report of drunk driving.",
  "Somebody ran me off the road. Somebody was driving really irresponsibly.",
  "That's enough to stop him down the road.",
  "What about cutting me off too quickly, you know?",
  "Cuts right in front of me. Really ticks me off.",
  "I think it's an entirely different case if the tip ­­ if the tip here was ­­ you know, I was at a party, this guy got in his car, he should not have turned the key on in that car, this guy is really drunk, you should stop that car on the road. I think that's totally different from somebody just saying, this guy swerved, or this guy drove me off the road. You're ­­ you're just making the assumption that ­­ that every ­­ every one of those incidents demonstrates a drunk behind the wheel, and I just don't think that's true.",
  "You don't think that a teenager standing on a street corner with a couple of other teenagers with a gun in his belt represents a threat to public safety?",
  "No? All right.",
  "Yeah, but that ­­ but that second danger ­­ you may have a drunken driver on the road; that danger can be eliminated by following the car. You don't have to stop the car right away. You can follow it and if, indeed, the driver seems to be driving erratically, then you can stop. You'd have probable cause. I don't think you have to automatically allow a stop in order to prevent all of the horribles that are going to arise from drunk driving. Follow the car. If he's behaving like a drunk driver, then stop him.",
  "That is so remote. I mean, it seems to me you're asking us to adopt a broad rule that is contrary to what we normally do for searches and seizures because, now and then, it would seem, to me, very rarely, before the police can stop the drunk driver, he kills somebody. I mean, I suppose that could happen now and then but it's pretty fanciful.",
  "What about drawing the line to use it. He's intentionally going to use it.",
  "Or maybe intentionally doing an action that is going to harm more than one person, as opposed to, hmm, maybe this person might accidentally, because he's inub­­ inebriated, hurt somebody? It seems to me there's a clear line between somebody who's ­­ who's bent on an intentional crime and somebody who might harm somebody because of his conduct. You like that one?",
  "Please finish what you were saying. I ­­ I didn't understand what your point was.",
  "I suppose ­­ I suppose that your answer to what sense it makes is that was the compromise, that there was strong opposition to any gun control law, and the condition was you get the buyer, and you don't make the buyer promise not to give it to somebody else. He could immediately give it to somebody who's unqualified to own the gun, couldn't he? Would that be a violation?",
  "What about somebody ­­ somebody who is qualified to own a firearm? Can I take a firearm that I own and say ­­ you know, it's yours?",
  "Don't have to register it? I don't have to go through a firearm dealer, right? It's my gun, and I can give it to somebody else who's qualified.",
  "So you're never going to know who the end user is once the gun is sold, whether you take the ­­ you know, the straw buyer's name or the ­­ or the other person's name or both. You don't know where the gun is going to end up, do you?",
  "He made that up.",
  "And in some cases, they can track it all the way. In this case, unlike the hypothetical that Justice Alito gave you, if they went to the straw, to the straw purchaser, he would say, oh, I actually bought it from my uncle. And he'd give the uncle's name, and then the uncle would say ­­ you know, where else the firearm went from him.",
  "What is the government's ­­ I guess I should ask the government, but does the government contend that there are two buyers now? Both ­­ is the real buyer the person who sends in the straw man so that it's only his information that you have to give? Or are there two buyers?",
  "Could ­­ could you address the other ­­ the other point here, which is the one I have more trouble with, to tell you the truth, Count 2?",
  "Can you lie in ­­ in answering questions that the government has no technical right to answer? I mean, let's assume I agree with you that, in fact, this information was ­­ the government was not authorized to obtain this information, and therefore, it was not required to be kept. But nonetheless they asked it, and your client didn't just say, I won't answer. He lied. Now, can you ­­ can you lie, so long as the question is improper?",
  "As to the first, are there two buyers in your view?",
  "Well, what does ­­ what does the person who's buying for somebody else ­­ he has to provide both names or just the name of the real buyer?",
  "And both of them had to take possession, right?",
  "But that's not the case here. The person who paid took possession, was authorized to take possession .",
  "So there are two buyers and both of them have to be on the form.",
  "Where’s the straw buyer? I can understand you saying the real buyer is the person who put up the money.",
  "Its current one. It used to have a different one.",
  "Why is that ­­ why is that any more horrible than the notion that as soon as I buy it I walk out of the store and I meet this guy in the parking lot, he says: Hey, that's a nifty looking gun there. How much did you pay for it? He says: You know, I paid 600 dollars. I'll give you 700. Oh, it's yours. Right? I can hand it to him, can't I?",
  "So the notion that the gun would somehow get into the hands of somebody who ­­ you know, who wasn't registered or who couldn't buy it himself, I mean that's going to happen any way. What you assert does not stop that problem.",
  "You wouldn't think of prosecuting him, would you?",
  "Before you go on ­­",
  "­­ I wanted to get back to the Al Capone hypothetical. As I understand Petitioner's case here, I don't think he's asserting that if Al Capone, if ­­ if he intended to transfer it to Al Capone, that his statement would not have been material. His position is, since I intended to transfer it to somebody who could lawfully possess it, the statement was immaterial.",
  "Is that on the appendix to your brief?",
  "I can't look at all these things because they are not in your brief. I really ­­ I really resent, especially in statutory cases, not having the statute in front of us. I shouldn't have to flip through your ­­ your brief to see what page you cite a little snippet from one section on.",
  "This is a criminal statute. And ­­ and you're saying that when ­­ when I buy it and I told somebody I'll sell it to you later, that I am acting as an agent? Wow. It's a criminal statute.",
  "The particular individual? She has to know each individual who ­­ who has been viewing her rape on ­­ on these pornographic items that have been distributed widely? She has to know each individual, or she can't be covered?",
  "The woman has undergone serious psychiatric harm because of her knowledge that there are thousands of people out there viewing her rape, but you say she can't ­­ why isn't your client at least responsible for some of that? Even without her knowing him, he had two of her pictures. He's one of the thousands of people who viewed ­­ who viewed her rape. So why can't she recover some amount from him? I mean, the other side says she ought to be able to recover everything from him. You say she ought to be able to recover nothing. What about something in­between? What ­­ what about figuring out how much of ­­ of her total psychiatric damage and all the expenses and what­not are attributable to this particular person?",
  "You said that for another question.",
  "Give me one facet.",
  "Yes. Well, now ­­ not because tort law has developed that, I mean, I frankly don't agree with what you say modern tort law is supposed to allow, and ­­ and Keeton ­­ you know, doesn't really establish that that's what the courts now do. But even without agreeing with that, can't I find that that is the system that this statute intended to impose? I mean, we're dealing here with a question of statutory interpretation. So the question is not what does modern tort law allow, but the question is what, reasonably, could Congress have meant by this statute?",
  "Because I'm not going to go along with you on ­­ you know, modern tort law. I think that's nonsense. I don't think it's true.",
  "Well, you don't deny but­for. I haven't understood your submission to be that there need not be but­for cause here.",
  "Well, you're ­­ you're confusing whether there's a specific amount of harm caused with whether it is easy to measure that harm. The ­­ the tort cases you refer to are cases in which there is a result produced that is not severable. You can't say this person is ­­ you know, accounts for this much of it, such as pollution, all the pollution there. The stream is polluted. That's quite different from this case where ­­ where this ­­ this young woman has been subjected to psychological harm because of thousands of people viewing her rape. Now, this ­­ she would be subjected to less psychological harm if it was just one person or ten people or a hundred people. In other words, each person increases the amount of her psychological harm. It is severable the way the tort cases you refer to are not. And so why shouldn't the question in this case be simply he caused a certain incremental amount of psychological harm to ­­ to this woman and he should pay for it and it's up to the district court to decide what the proper amount of that payment ought to be.",
  "I understand.",
  "But they're certainly not using your theory. Even though it's not plucked out of the air, they're certainly not using your theory.",
  "Yes. So they're using some theory.",
  "And you have no idea what that is and can't suggest one, right?",
  "And that's wonderful and ­­ you know, I ­­ I want to go along with you. This is a bad guy, and ­­ and he ought to be punished, and he ought to give restitution, but there is such a thing as due process of law. And what you're saying is ­­ I have no idea how much he's going to be required to turn over, whether it's going to be ­­ what was it in this case, $3 million?",
  "I have no idea what he's going to be socked with, and that's not what we usually do with criminal statutes.",
  "You just can't say leave it up to the district judge ­­ you know, and they all come out different ways, but who cares, it's ­­ you know, so long as it's within some ­­",
  "­­ some reasonable amount.",
  "That's just not the way we do law.",
  "That's because the statute says so. It says you get from ­­ you know, 10 to 20 years, okay? But the statute here doesn't say ­­ you know, you'll ­­ you'll get between this and this, whatever the district judge likes. It doesn't say that. It says you ­­ you should compensate the victim for what ­­ for what you've caused her.",
  "We have a fudge factor here? Can a ­­ can a district judge use what he calls a fudge factor ­­ this is a criminal statute. It's not a tort case.",
  "We're going to be liable for a fudge factor.",
  "He had two pictures. He did not distribute at all. He was not a distributor, right?",
  "He was just convicted of possessing two pictures. And ­­ and the statute doesn't even require intentional possession, just knowing possession, right? He could have gotten them by accident. He knew he got them, but he never took them off of his computer, but he's still guilty of the crime. So I ­­ he's guilty ­­ he's guilty of the crime. But to sock him for all of her ­­ all of her psychiatric costs and everything else because he had two pictures of her? Congress couldn't have intended that.",
  "Like Justice Sotomayor and like the government here, I think, even if there is a proximate cause requirement, it has been ­­ it has been met, once you adopt the aggregate offense notion. But I wanted to ask you about Subsection (F). My ­­ it doesn't seem to me that you ­­ whether or not you read the proximate cause element in (F) into (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E), it seems to me what you have to read into (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) is the portion of (F) which says, \"any other losses suffered by the victim as a result of the offense.\" \"Of the offense.\" Is it only (F) that is limited to the particular offense, and (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) means those ­­ those items that come from anybody else's conviction?",
  "So he should contribute to the payment. You're saying he contributed to the harm, but he makes 100 percent of the payment. That doesn't seem to me to make much sense.",
  "They don't say from that person.",
  "This is subsequent legislative history? Is that what this is?",
  "Even those that like legislative history don't like subsequent legislative history.",
  "It's certainly not measurable. The agency doesn't even assert that it's measurable, right?",
  "I didn't read them as saying that anyway. I read them as saying they'll try to do it, but make whatever exemptions are necessary.",
  "It ­­ it clearly is not a matter of the EPA simply saying we can't do it right away, but we're going to do it eventually.",
  "It hasn't said that.",
  "Is that your second point? I've been keeping a list here of points you ­­ you have not been permitted to get to.",
  "One, you were going to discuss not just the Massachusetts case, but the follow­on case to Massachusetts.",
  "You never did that, yes.",
  "The other thing ­­ you were going to give two points and you only got to ­­ what is it ­­ 7411(e), but there was another point.",
  "You got the first, which was the ­­",
  "Right.",
  "Well, you ­­ you'd accept his definition, wouldn't you? You'd be happy with a definition that says air pollutant means any air pollutant to the extent it can be sensibly controlled under the statute. And you would say this one obviously can't.",
  "So that would be a wonderful definition.",
  "Why? Why would it be unreasonable to give ­­ give EPA authority to regulate mobile sources and not authority to ­­ to regulate stationary sources, given that stationary sources have to be licensed in this fashion and it ­­ it produces all sorts of other problems? That doesn't seem to me irrational at all.",
  "Yes, but the 34­year agency interpretation is not a statute.",
  "And you are ­­ you know, you are saying, oh, rather than alter our 34­year interpretation, we're ­­ we're going to revise the provisions of the statute. I don't think that's a ­­ that's a good trade.",
  "General Verrilli, you know, I don't have as expansive a notion of reading exceptions into a statute that are not there as Justice Breyer does. But assuming, just assuming that you can ­­ you can read exceptions, that isn't the issue here. The issue is whether you can read in exceptions unnecessarily when the absurdity in question doesn't flow inevitably from the statute, when the statute can be interpreted another way that would not produce the absurdity. Aren't you compelled where there is ambiguity to adopt the interpretation of the statute that does not produce absurdity rather than adopting the interpretation that produces absurdity, and then going around altering the provisions of the contract ­­ of the statute? I mean, to take Justice Breyer's bubble gum example, yes, I suppose it ­­ would you have to make an exception for bubble gum in the display window if the statute were subject to two interpretations, one of which would include display windows, and the other one of which wouldn't. It seems to me, of course, you would have to adopt the interpretation that didn't include display windows. And that's what is going on here. There's ­­ there's ­­ yes, there's absurdity but the issue is how is that absurdity to be taken account of? By simply letting EPA rewrite the very clear numbers in the statute, or else by adopting a permissible interpretation of the statute that does not lead to that absurdity. And I think that's quite a different question from ­­ from what we've been discussing.",
  "In the ­­ you know, the argument against that is, no, that the statute evidences concern with ambient air quality and requires that to be measured. And the agency acknowledges that you cannot possibly measure the effect on ambient air quality of greenhouse gases. So it is not clearly compatible with the statute to bring greenhouse gases into regulation.",
  "I don't think so. I mean, it depends on what you mean by \"unthinkable,\" General Verrilli. Is it ­­",
  "But what is supposed to be unthinkable, that greenhouse gases should not be regulated? Maybe that is unthinkable. But the issue is, is it unthinkable that Congress did not intend to regulate greenhouse gases when it enacted the current provisions of the statute?",
  "Where have the sea levels risen other than Massachusetts?",
  "Is that all we're talking ­­ you know, if I were arguing your side of the case, I would ­­ I would not say that the bank got defrauded of money. Your client never got the money.

What the fraud here consisted of is that the bank got a ­­ a loan, a mortgage, an interest in property, assured by a less­than­solvent debtor when it expected to get an interest in property assured by a solvent debtor. And it's ­­ why isn't the nature of the fraud precisely the mortgage? This is not as good a mortgage as the bank anticipated it was getting.

  "The baseball bat is not a return of part of the property that was stolen.",
  "Nor is the cartload of rotten tomatoes.",
  "So what are we talking about here?",
  "Why didn't you say that? You were quibbling about when it should be valued. You should have said it doesn't come under B at all.",
  "Not if it doesn't come into the statute at all.",
  "What if I don't think that the ­­ that the mortgage has anything to do with returning property, that a mortgage ­­ the real estate is not cash. Okay? What if I think it doesn't come under B at all? How would it be treated if it doesn't come under B?",
  "Cash hasn't been returned. I mean, you could say the same thing about the baseball bat. He gives him a baseball bat. It had nothing to do with the cash that he got, and ­­ and you would say, well, when he sells the baseball bat, he gets cash, therefore cash has been returned. That's surely not right, is it?",
  "It's the same with the baseball bat, right?",
  "Yes, it's under ­­",

  "Well, why should the defendant here subsidize the banks playing the market? That's what you are saying.",
  "The bank is playing the market. It says, yeah, we could sell it for so much now, but, yeah, it may go up. And you're saying that, you know, he's paying for the bank's roll of the dice.",
  "Well, it's not just more complicated. It's a question of, I guess, who has the burden. As I understood, what you are proposing is you get the sale price, but it's ­­ it's available to the defendant to show that the sale price was unreasonably low because of gamesmanship on the part of the bank or some other reason, right?",
  "Yes.",
  "You would prefer that to the other formulation, wouldn't you?",
  "Well, you know, once you ­­ once you have a statute that confers discretion on a district court, you don't expect uniformity of decision­making.

  "­­ on the part of the district courts?",
  "It seems to me it quite clearly doesn't.",
  "Well ­­ well, you ­­ you acknowledged that a lot of these cases ­­ probably most of these cases do not involve exclusively legal issues. Right?",
  "And so in ­­ in all of those cases you're not going to get uniformity, because their ­­ you acknowledge that in ­­ in the nonlegal issues, there is discretion in the district court.

And the reason you can't is, since it is a totality of the circumstances test, that is only one factor and it doesn't have to be an absolute degree of meritlessness. Even in a ­­ I assume you would say that even in a very close case, if there has been outrageous litigation abuse by the other side, the court would be able to say: My goodness, I've never seen lawyers behave like this. You're going to pay the attorneys' fees for the other side. Couldn't the ­­ couldn't the court do that?",
  "So then how can we possibly define meritless? We can't, because it goes up and down, even in a case where it's ­­ it's a close case, it could still be exceptional.",
  "No matter what other factors exist, it has to be objectively unreasonable.",
  "I mean, even if it is clear from other factors that this is a shakedown, a big country ­­ a big company trying to suppress a little company, even if it's clear that there has been outrageous litigation abuse, misconduct by attorneys?",
  "All of those things cannot justify shifting the award unless it is objectively unreasonable.",
  "Oh, okay.",
  "You want to add et cetera, right?",
  "But it's in the Senate report, so ­­",
  "So if that's what you mean, why don't you say exceptional injustice instead of gross injustice?",
  "To the Senate ­­ to the Senate report.",
  "Do you think Congress could not require the loser to pay ­­ in all cases?",
  "­­ in all cases?",
  "I mean, if it can do that, there's certainly no First Amendment problem.",
  "That's the English rule. It used to be our rule. I don't see how you can possibly say that it's unconstitutional to make the loser pay.",
  "Mr. Phillips, their lawyers might well have given them different advice if they didn't know that, Hey, nothing to lose, given the test that the Federal Circuit has, you know.",
  "Hey, I would give ­­ I would give the same advice. Bring the suit.",
  "This guy is a possible competitor, sue him. Hey, there's nothing to lose.",
  "If it goes to litigation, yes. But if ­­ if the alternative for the defendant is either, you know, spend $2 million defending or pay off the $10,000 that ­­ that the plaintiff demands to go away, hey, that's an easy call.",
  "But ­­ but we didn't ­­ we didn't base our decision in Atkins upon a study of what the American Psychiatric Association and other medical associations considered to be mental retardation. We based it on what ­­ what was the general rule that States had adopted. And a large number of States had adopted 70 as the criterion. I mean, the criterion is what do the American people think is the level of mental retardation that should make it impossible to impose the death penalty. We didn't look for the answer to that question to the APA or any of the other medical associations. We looked to what the States did. Now, what has changed in what the States do? Anything?",
  "The SEM being ­­ being what and ­­ and established by whom?",
  "For what purpose do they establish these scores? Is it for the purpose of determining who is so incapable of ­­ of controlling his actions that he shouldn't be subject to the death penalty? Is that ­­ is that what they're looking for when they establish 70 to 75? What are they looking for?",
  "Right.",
  "I'm not talking about IQ tests in general. I'm talking about why do they pick ­­ they used to pick 70. Now they pick between 70 and 75 as the upper limit. What are ­­ upper limit for what? I assume it is for people who would profit from medical treatment. Isn't that it?",
  "They change ­­ they changed their mind, counsel. This APA is the same organization that once said that homosexuality was a ­­ was a mental disability and now says it's perfectly normal. They change their minds.",
  "And they have changed their minds as to whether 70 or 75 is the ­­ is the new test ­­ for for mental retardation.",
  "So you want us to decide this case and establish the principle, the ­­ the very significant principle that where you have a ­­ a criminal defendant condemned to death for ­­ for murder whose scores are 71, 72, 73, 74, and 80, that's okay? That's all you're trying to persuade us of? I mean, I'm not very happy having to go through this in all future cases where you have somebody who has 69, 73, 74, 75, and 81. I mean, don't you have some more general principle, other than the particular scores in this case are good enough.",
  "General Winsor, we ­­",
  "­­ we don't allow all factors to be considered, do we? Would ­­ would the State have been able to refute his assertion of mental retardation by pointing to the fact that he is the one who seized the young woman, who pushed her into a car, who drove the car with his accomplice following in another car, and who killed her, and ­­ and killed another ­­ and killed a policeman, too, later, I guess.",
  "Could the State bring that in and say somebody who is mentally retarded enough ­­ so mentally retarded as not to be responsible and not to be subject to the death penalty certainly could not have pulled all of this off. This is not a person who is that mentally retarded, significantly mental ­­ mentally retarded. Could the State show that ­­",
  "He didn't raise mental retardation until 10 years after his first conviction; isn't that right?",
  "How has it gone on this long? 1978 is when he killed this woman.",
  "General Winsor, maybe you should ask us ­­",
  "­­ that question, inasmuch ­­",
  "­­ as most of the delay has been because of rules that we have imposed.",
  "I thought it said ­­ did it not say in its opinion that there was room for disagreement or whether this was reasonable or not? Did they have some such statement?",
  "Yes, I'd like you to talk about that.",
  "And is that ­­ is that how you think the jurisdictional question should be resolved, that whenever ­­ as you know, there's ­­ there's a disagreement in the courts of appeals as to what you do when there are claims that there are factual disputes. Some courts ­­ well, we've held that where the only issue raised is a factual dispute, there's no jurisdiction. Some courts say that so long as you assert a claim to qualified immunity, there is jurisdiction, okay. Let's assume that that's the rule. What do we do with factual disputes? Is it your position that you ­­ you simply assume them to be in the ­­ in the Respondents's favor?",
  "Well, you would say genuine factual disputes. I mean, if ­­ if there's something that is not at all frivolous. I mean, it's not supported by the record, I wouldn't call that a genuine factual dispute.",
  "And ­­ and how does that work out here?",
  "You would say that it doesn't really matter whether he bumped the police cruisers when he was finally cornered, whether he tried to back up into one of the officers, that all of that is just excrescences, that it was enough to justify the shooting that he was driving at 100 miles an hour, swerving around the road, endangering human life and would likely continue that if they let him to get away?",
  "Had admitted what?",
  "Well, he does in his ­­ in his briefing here.",
  "I could see how the passenger could complain, but ­­ but I can't see how the ­­ how the ­­ the criminal fleeing felon who put the passenger in danger can say, you shouldn't have shot because you ­­ oh, you hurt my passenger. Isn't there some problem of his standing to complain about that problem.",
  "Mr. Bash, what's the government's position on the jurisdictional question?",
  "Yes. I understand that. But what ­­ what about a dispute as to the purely factual issues, if there is a dispute about that? Does that mean the court can't ­­ can't take the case?",
  "I know that. How would you resolve this struggle is what I'm asking you.",
  "Yes, but Johnson involved only disputed facts. They asked this Court to resolve the factual question, period. I understood Johnson to say of course you can't take that. But we have here a case where, although there may be disputed facts, the other side would say ­­ or your side would say that they are irrelevant.",
  "Okay. And you would agree that we should resolve them in the Respondent's favor to the extent that the record supports that?",
  "The car is still trying to escape. The car is not stopped and, you know, the driver with his hands up. The car is still trying to get out of this encirclement by the other police cars, right?",
  "Is he trying to get away at that point or not?",
  "Mr. Smith, I was ­­ I was surprised to read what you said in your ­­ in your brief on page 25: At a minimum, reasonable minds could differ on the issue of the Petitioners' objective reasonableness. And that ­­ isn't that enough to decide this case?",
  "You say that, even though what they did was arguably reasonable, right ­­",
  "­­ immunity does not apply?",
  "We don't it to the jury about whether, you know, whether the police officers violated the Fourth Amendment or not. The rule is if ­­ if indeed there is no clear violation on their part, if they had no reason to know that what they were doing violated the Fourth Amendment, they are entitled to the immunity. And here you have that statement at a minimum, reasonable minds could differ on the issue of their objective reasonableness. Do you still believe that, that reasonable minds could differ on the issue of their objective reasonableness?",
  "At a minimum. At a minimum. I mean it could be even worse.",
  "I don't care what it's addressing. It's addressing a state of facts, that reasonable minds could differ on the issue of Petitioners' ­­ do you want to take that back?",
  "I think you ought to take it back.",
  "Such as? What?",
  "They didn't block him. He got away. How can you say they had the ability to block him? He got away, didn't he ­­",
  "That's too general a rule, and our cases hold that you cannot appeal to a very general rule to say the law is clear. You have to show that the law as applied to these circumstances was clear. And there's nothing about shooting out tires that I know of.",
  "The danger is he is going to be going 100 miles an hour, okay, that the chase up to now has been the way your client's chase was, in which he endangered a lot of other people, forced cars off the road, and so forth. That's ­­ that's the ­­ that's the hypothetical. Okay. That person is about to drive away and continue that kind of public­endangering behavior. Can the policeman shoot or not.",
  "No, no. There's nobody around, just ­­ just him.",
  "There is nobody around. Can ­­ can they shoot at him to stop him from endangering the public again?",
  "Of course, we ­­ you know ­­",
  "You're just not willing to give answers. But we've been discussing this as though that's the question, what should the policeman do? But that's not the question. The question is, was there clearly established law that made it apparent that this was improper police conduct? That's the question. Not what is proper police conduct, but was there clearly established law that this was not proper police conduct? What's your best case for that?",
  "So some of ­­",
  "Was she trying to get out of the car when ­­ when he was trapped there and, you know, surrounded by the police car?",
  "She didn't try to get out of the car. I mean, for all the police knew, she ­­ he ­­ she was a ­­ a cohort of his. He fled. Why was he fleeing, by the way? He just didn't want to ­­ didn't want to get a ticket for the broken headlight?",
  "No ­­ I thought that there was some indication that he had drugs.",
  "Yes. So that's probably why he was fleeing.",
  "And she might have been a cohort of that. Do ­­ do ­­ are the police supposed to know that? She made no effort to get out of the car.",
  "Well, I'd think you'd think pretty quick in a situation like that, where this guy has been driving you on the highway at 100 miles an hour, swerving into and away from police cars. Boy, I would get out of that car so fast.",
  "Of course it's a factor, but is it a factor that your clients can take advantage of? That's the issue. I mean, maybe you ­­ you can demote the policeman who did that. Maybe even a lawsuit by ­­ by ­­ by the colleague in the car would be successful. But the issue is whether your client has any reason to complain about that, your client who caused the whole thing, who caused the shooting in the last analysis.",
  "Okay. This ­­ this is a new principle. You think it is clearly established law, clearly established law, that you cannot shoot to kill a driver whose ­­ whose car is moving? Is that it?",
  "Is that the principle you say is clearly established?",
  "My goodness, they do it all the time. You watch the movies about bank robberies, you know, it happens all the time. Are these movies unrealistic? You cannot shoot to kill somebody in a moving car.",
  "And that is ­­ that is not just your view. It is, you say, clearly established law.",
  "And that's what Scott holds, that you can ­­",
  "What does hold it? Sir, you are arguing that the law is clearly established. That's the case you have to make. You can't just get up here and say you shouldn't shoot at somebody in a moving car to kill. Maybe you shouldn't. What is the clearly established law that ­­ that policemen should have known?",
  "Talks about it?",
  "Talks about it?",
  "What facts do you contest and we'll just subtract them from the facts that we consider. Which facts do you contest? That he was driving 100 miles an hour, swerving on the road, swerved towards police cars, almost cause another car to go ­­ that's ­­ you don't contest that.",
  "That's not a fact. That's ­­ that's a conclusion. Whether the car was a ­­ was a danger is a legal conclusion, not a fact. What facts do you ­­ do you say are contested?",
  "Right.",
  "Okay. We'll assume no assaults. What else?",
  "All right. We'll eliminate the ramming. What else?",
  "Let's assume ­­ we'll assume he was not in danger. Okay.",
  "But we ­­ we are still left with a very dangerous man careening down the road, who is surrounded by police cars and still tries to get away to continue his careening. You can eliminate all those minor facts that you're contesting and it's still a very dangerous situation.",
  "We don't care about the seconds.",
  "Place it in the context.",
  "It's certainly not the rule ­­ it's certainly not the rule that every ­­ every issue that is common has ­­ has to be decided at the preliminary ­­ or I'm sorry, must be left to the merits. I mean, as you point out, the very issue of whether the market is efficient is something that could be decided for everybody at the merits stage, right?",
  "How many ­­ how many of these cases ­­ what percentage of these cases continue once there has been class certification? Do you have any idea?",
  "Very few. Once you get the class certified, the case is over, right?",
  "Did we refer to Section",
  "­­ in connection with that dictum?",
  "I think maybe we didn't know about it, as the parties here seemingly did not know about it. I don't think it was cited in the briefs.",
  "Of course. But ­­ but to act on the assumption that the courts are going to do what they've been doing is quite different from approving what the courts have been doing. As I understand the history of these things, there was one side that wanted to overrule Basic and the other side that wanted to endorse Basic, and they did neither one. They simply enacted a law that assumed that the courts were going to continue Basic. I don't see that that is ­­ is necessarily a ratification of it. It's just an acknowledgment of reality.",
  "Mr. Boies, you've said that ­­ that a lot of class certification motions are denied. I had thought that your friend said that that is very rare except in the Second Circuit.",
  "Did I hear that wrong, or ­­",
  "­­ is he wrong?",
  "Mr. Boise, you and I both agree that the PSLRA assumes Basic. Now, we differ on, you know, what that means, but it does assume it. What ­­ and ­­ and so those previsions would ­­ would sort of be useless if Basic were entirely overruled. What if we adopted the professors' ­­ what, Basic writ small, if ­­ if we adopted their approach, would those provisions of the PSLRA still be effective?",
  "All right.",

  "Could you be more specific? What are the particular aspects of other accounts that you think would not qualify?",
  "Well, there ­­ there's another respect in which this, even as originally enacted, does not track the ­­ the preemployment Division v. Smith law. That is to say, the ­­ the compelling State interest test in the prior cases was never accompanied by a least restrictive alternative requirement. That was an invention of this ­­ of this law.",
  "Well, of course it wouldn't be the same price at the end of the day. If they deny health insurance, they're going to have to raise wages if they are going to get employees.",

  "It's more than pre­Smith.",
  "Plus ­­",
  "Okay.",

  "If ­­ if they wanted you to balance ­­ balance the interest of the religious objector against the interest of other individuals, they ­­ they made no reference to that in RFRA at all.",
  "They said unless the government has a compelling State interest.",
  "But that wasn't the basis for ­­ for denying the claim. The basis was that the government has to run a uniform system that applies to everybody.",
  "And you can't argue that here because the government has made a lot of exemptions.",
  "It was an individual making a profit, right?",
  "He was running a business for a profit, and that was the point of ­­ of Justice Alito's question, right, which I think you understood.",
  "Not a single case in which it was denied exemption, either. All you're saying is ­­",
  "­­ that there are no cases.",
  "Not on the ground that it was a for­profit enterprise. There is not a single case which says that a for­profit enterprise cannot make a ­­ a freedom of religion claim, is there?",
  "Right.",
  "Whoever controls the corporation. Whoever controls the corporation determines what the party ­­",
  "So don't make them sign a piece of paper.",
  "You're talking about, what, three or four birth controls, not all of them, just those that are abortifacient. That's not terribly expensive stuff, is it?",
  "Except that they passed RFRA after that. That made a lot of sense. But the question is they passed RFRA after that.",
  "That's okay for not­for­profit corporations to do that with respect to all of their employees, and some of them are pretty big operations ­­",
  "­­ that's okay there?",
  "They can make ­­ you allow them to make this religious objection, don't you?",
  "But they don't have to pay for it, right?",
  "And you could set that up this way, that these people don't have to pay for it.",
  "Counsel, I don't understand the government to be making the argument, and I can't understand why it isn't making the argument, that it doesn't matter whether there was any intent to suppress anti­Bush demonstrations, that in this area, as in traffic stops, we don't consult subjective intent. If ­­ if a policeman stops somebody, and it's, oh, you stopped me only because I was coming back from an anti­Bush demonstration, we wouldn't ­­ we wouldn't listen to that argument. We'd say, did you have a broken taillight or not? If you had a broken taillight, we do not inquire into the subjective intent of the officer. Why is it any different here?",
  "You haven't made it.",
  "You don't even have to get into that. You don't have to get into clearly established law. It's a very simple case. If you say, was there objectively a reason to move these people? If there was, if you had an ulterior motive that was unconstitutional, we don't inquire into it.",
  "I don't ­­ what does that answer mean?",
  "I can't understand why you didn't brief it then in that case. I cannot understand why you didn't brief it. And ­­ and talking about things that we haven't ­­ haven't held in the past, we haven't even held in the past that ­­ that there is a Bivens cause of action for a First Amendment violation, have we?",
  "Do we have any cases that has held that?",
  "That's not a mixed motive. Why ­­ why do you accept the description of that as a mixed motive case?",
  "If you agreed with my hypothetical, the point is it doesn't matter what the officer's motive was. It does not matter. If there's an objective basis for a traffic stop, even if his sole motive was discriminatory, the stop is nonetheless valid. This is not a mixed motive issue.",
  "Then don't ­­ just don't call it mixed motive. It confuses everything. It confuses everything.",
  "You know, I really ­­ I really don't understand what the government is doing here. It seems to me you want to win this case, but not too big.",
  "In ­­ in light of the arguments waived below and the arguments not made here, you want us to find for you, but on the narrowest possible ground. I would think it is in the interest of the United States and the Secret Service to say there are no Bivens First Amendment actions, but you don't make that argument. Didn't make it below; don't make it here. Likewise, it would be in their interest to say, oh, this is just like a traffic stop. It doesn't matter whether we had a ­­ a bad motive so long as there was an objective reason, that's the end, but you don't make that argument here either. I ­­ I really can't understand what the government is trying to do here.",
  "Counsel, do you acknowledge that ­­ that the issue here is whether the law was clearly established? Do you agree with that?",
  "I'm not saying whether you believe it is. Is that the ­­ if you find it wasn't clearly established, do you lose, is what I'm saying?",
  "Okay. Now, how can it be clearly established if we have never held that there is a Bivens cause of action for a First Amendment violation? We've never held that, have we? How can you possibly say that the violation here is clearly established.",
  "Oh, it is pernicious. But is there a Bivens action for it? The Constitution does not create a cause of action for this. 1983 doesn't cover this. We invented it out of ­­ really out of nothing, and we have not extended that to First Amendment violations up to now.",
  "Well, regardless of whether it was made below, it certainly goes to the argument that was made below and here, that the violation here was not clearly established.",
  "Well, okay.",
  "That's a good point.",
  "That's a good point.",
  "You're the farthest thing from a security expert if you don't know the answer to that one.",
  "I don't think the government has conceded that.",
  "I don't think the government conceded that at all.",
  "Excuse me. I'm not sure. If you stop a car because you think the participants in it were coming back from a protest against President Bush, is that a Fourth Amendment case or a First Amendment case, if that's your allegation? The only reason the car was stopped was because of the viewpoint that these people have. Is that a Fourth Amendment case or a First Amendment case?",
  "Yeah, I would think so. And you think that so long as you make that First Amendment allegation, it doesn't matter if you have a broken taillight.",
  "Wow.",

  "Yes, but my hypothetical was different. There ­­ there is no such distinction. There is no statute of limitations. It's only what you call a statute of repose. And I think you have to say that in that situation, it is no longer a statute of repose, that it's a statute of limitations.",
  "When was this statute enacted? What was it?",
  "'86. I thought­­Okay.",
  "To tell you the truth, I've never heard of this distinction between statutes of repose and statutes of limitations.",
  "Well, yes. But have they ever ­­ have they ever drawn a distinction between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose? Is there any Federal statute that makes that distinction or ­­ or is there any Federal statute which applies only to statutes of repose?",
  "Oh yeah. It exists. I mean, these statutes exist, but ­­ but are they called statutes of repose? Or are they ­­ are they not considered, as I used to consider them when I was in law school and even as late as 1986, I ­­ I would have considered that a statutes of limitations. Now, you think Congress is smarter. They ­­ they know the law better.",
  "And everybody was listening to that. The chamber was full and ­­",
  "Are you acknowledging that if a State had only a so­called statute of repose, that ­­ that the Federal limitation would apply to that? It's only a statute of ­­ of repose piggybacked on what we've been calling a statute of limitations. It's only that one that survives.",
  "I think you can answer the question yes ­­ yes or no.",
  "Right.",
  "That's why you want to give it away.",
  "Okay. You have a statute to say there is ­­ there is a cause of action for X, okay, and a separate statute ­­ there exists a cause of action for X. And a separate statute which says any ­­ any suit for X cannot be brought after 10 years from the act of the defendant that is the basis for the claim. Okay? Why ­­ why isn't that the commencement date on which you can bring suit where ­­ where the act occurs.",
  "And therefore ­­ and therefore it should be repealed, not and therefore should be covered by the Federal statute.",
  "Anyway, as the government argued, it doesn't matter. It's not a matter of terminology. It's a matter of reality. It's a matter that these two things, whether they were given different names in 1986 or not, are quite different things. And do you ­­ do you deny that they are quite different things, and that therefore the statute may apply quite differently?",
  "Well, then you stumble into the difficulty that Petitioner pointed out, or maybe it was the government pointed out. (A)(1) does not refer to two statutes of limitations. It says if the applicable limitations period for such action as specified in the State statute of limitations provides a commencement date which is earlier. Now, you know, if they were really covering two different, or envisioned that in some States you had two statutes of limitations, it seems to me they should have phrased it differently: If the applicable limitations period or periods for such action as specified in the States' statutes of limitations provide ­­ provides a commencement date or commencement dates, something like that. It's all in the singular.",
  "But, you know, the statute does not refer to your cause of action, so it's hard to say that the period refers to ­­ it refers to is the period that you are trying to get around. It says if the limitations period for such action, that is, any action brought under ­­ any action brought under State law. I think to read that as applying to whatever limitations period is asserted by ­­ against a particular plaintiff, I find it hard to read it that way. It seems to me they're referring to a limitations period for the action that exists under State law, regardless of what is alleged in the particular complaint. Anyway, I ­­ I think you got a real problem with the singular versus plural phrasing of number (1).",
  "Yeah, except they are both applicable to this cause of action. They ­­ both of those periods are applicable. You run afoul of one of them, but not of the other one. It doesn't mean they're ­­ they are not both applicable. Anyway, this is ­­ this is ­­ it is angels on the head of a pin, isn't it?",
  "But the more you talk about horribles that could happen, a State could say, with respect to the special cause of action for creating harm to individuals by hazardous waste, the statute will begin upon discovery and it will last for 3 months. A State could do that, right? And that would comply with this law, wouldn't it? A 3­month statute of limitations. All the Federal law refers to is when the statute commences. But it ­­ it still is left up to the State to say how long the statute can be, isn't it?",
  "No, no.",
  "You can answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to that, I think. The State can make the statute of limitations as short as it wants so long as it commences upon the discovery.",
  "So I can ­­ I can imagine a lot of horribles that can occur with that, just as you can imagine horribles that occur under the other system.",
  "But you ­­ you acknowledge that it ­­ it would be a valid patent if all you said is you have to space these things and you figure out what the spacing is going to be. You ­­ you can ­­ you can get a patent for ­­ tell somebody trial and error. Let's take Edison's light bulb. I mean, could he say, you know, get some material that ­­ that will ­­ will illumine when ­­ when electricity is passed through it and you figure out by trial and error what this material might be. Might be tungsten, who knows, you know. Maybe it's chewing gum. Would that be a valid patent?",
  "So I don't ­­ I don't really understand this trial and error spacing stuff. What ­­ what is the limit on trial and error? Can you get patented anything when you say, you know, this is the basic principle, you figure out what ­­ you know, what makes it work.",
  "No. I understand that.",
  "I'm asking why the second construction is ­­ is a plausible patentable invention.",
  "All the person skilled in the art will know is that he has to figure out what the spacing is, right?",
  "But ­­ but still the ­­ the inventor doesn't tell you what the spacing has to be.",
  "Well, the only ­­ the only analog that comes to my mind immediately is our review of agency action. Is ­­ is that the standard that you want us to use? If ­­ if, you know, it's within the scope of the ambiguity, oh, we don't think that's the right answer. But it's close enough for government work. Is that ­­ is that what you want us to apply to patents?",
  "Can it be reasonable but wrong.",
  "I see. Whatever interpretation is wrong is ipso facto unreasonable?",
  "Okay. So whatever is wrong is ­­ is, by your definition ­­ you know, we ­­ we construe statutes all the time, and we certainly don't think that the result we come to is the only reasonable result. We think it's the best result, but not the only reasonable one. But you're saying in this field there's a right result and everything else is unreasonable.",
  "Yes, that's what I proposed first. But I thought ­­ I thought you didn't like that.",
  "Yes. We understand all that. I ­­ I'm still having trouble understanding what your standard is. You ­­ you agree that your standard is not, there is a right answer and everything that is not the right answer is unreasonable. That's not your position.",
  "Right?",
  "Okay. Then you invoke Chevron. Do you mean that anything that would pass Chevron's step one is okay?",
  "That is, if it would pass Chevron's step one it's ambiguous.",
  "If that's ­­ if that's what it held we wouldn't have taken this case. I thought we took it because it had some really extravagant language.",
  "I mean, it's one thing to run away from that language, as your brief does. It's another thing to deny that it exists.",
  "Would this patent be valid if the concurrence's approach prevailed? It wouldn't work, would it? It would not work. The mere fact that you spaced it somewhere where the hands can touch it would not necessarily produce the result, would it?",
  "That's all the claim said.",
  "Right.",
  "Whereby. Whereby. I would read that as saying so long as you put the spacing at some point where the hands can touch it and they are not touching, that will produce the result that the signals will be equalized. That's how I would read the claim.",
  "No, no.",
  "No. Yes, I understand that, but that's not what it says. It doesn't say space the electrodes in such a manner that the signals coming from each side will be equal and you'll have to do this by trial and error. That's not what it says. It just says, you know, keep the electrodes apart. They have to be apart so that the hands don't touch, and on the other hand they can't be outside the scope of what the hands grip. That's all it says. Whereby, if you do that, the signals will be equalized. That's ­­ that's how I would read it. It wouldn't work that way, would it?",
  "Let the record show that the Justice is holding his fingers in the air.",
  "You know, I can understand that if the claim said that. If the claim said, you know, fiddle with it until it works. But it doesn't say that. It just says, you know, spacing, and I would think so long as there's space, they don't touch, and they're no more than the widths of the hands, it'll work. It doesn't say that. I don't think the \"whereby\" is ­­ is an invitation to experiment. But the other case you were talking about, tell us more about it. It just said a high angle.",
  "There's never more than one correct construction. Even ­­ even when there is there isn't. I mean, we always have to come up with an answer. And the patent office has to come up with an answer. It means this or it doesn't mean this. Have you ever heard of a court that says, well, you know, it could mean either one of these?",
  "It's a tie.",
  "So then you win all the time.",
  "There is no such thing as ambiguity, because there is always a right answer.",
  "When do we ever decide a case in which we would not say that our result is appreciably better than the result we reject?",
  "Well, it's still close, but not appreciably better. If it's not appreciably better, we would have to say it's a draw.",
  "Well, I think the test you're giving us is not much of a test, it really isn't. It seems to me it says so long as there is a right answer, everything else is wrong.",

  "But that gets you into the arrest for, you know, for not wearing a seat belt, and it seems absurd that you should be able to search that person's iPhone. And you can avoid that if you ­­ if you say, look, in the vast majority of cases, this is not going to be a problem, unless the officer can reasonably be looking for evidence of the crime of arrest.

  "I understand. But you ­­ so you're arguing for a new rule. The rule right up to now has been you can ­­ we can seize it. We can examine it totally. If it's a book, we can read every page of the book. You want a new rule for cell phones, right?",

  "Can't you say that at least in this case where ­­ where the State court's interpretation flouts well­accepted universal contract law principles, the most important of which is you interpret a contract in a manner that makes it valid rather than invalid.

  "It may be, but that's quite different from the question of whether there was an arbitration agreement.

  "But wouldn't ­­ wouldn't the second jury have to know the facts relevant to mitigation, as well as aggravation, I suppose, that came out in the main trial?",
  "We have to do it, though, right? I mean, that's ­­ that's part of ­­ part of our jurisprudence. So what ­­ what do you think are the ­­ are ­­ are the factors that would suggest the jury would have come out a different way had the rule that you urge been adopted? What ­­ what specifically? One is the shackling of the ­­ of the co­defendant?",
  "Now, wait a minute. You're ­­ you're representing the brother who was the alleged corrupting influence, right?",
  "The corruptor was sentenced, by the same jury, to death. So how could it possibly be that without the corrupting action of your client, the jury would have sentenced your client to life even though the corruptee was sentenced to death? That doesn't seem to me at all likely.",
  "Let me ­­ let me put the crime to you. You tell me which of these descriptions of the ­­ of the crime are ­­ are incorrect. These two men broke into a house in which there were three men and two women. They ordered the five to remove their clothes, forced them into a closet. Over the course of three hours, they demanded that the two women perform various sexual acts on one another. They demanded at gunpoint that each of the three men have sexual intercourse with both women. Then Reginald drove the victims one by one to various ATMs to withdraw cash. Jonathan raped or attempted to rape both women twice, and Reginald raped Holly G., who later testified, once. Placing the three men, still naked, in the trunk of one of their cars, the cars drove all five to a soccer field, forced them to kneel in the snow, and shot them execution­style in the back of the head. One of them, fortuitously, was not killed because ­­ I think it was a hair clip that she was wearing deflected the bullet. And she is the one who testified to all of this activity. And you truly think ­­ oh, and they ran over her too. After shooting her in the head, the car ran over her. You truly think that this jury, but for the fact that your client was a corruptor, would not have imposed the death penalty?",
  "But it ­­",
  "But it has to have been harmless inasmuch as the person who was influenced by your client also got the death penalty. How can you say that what made the difference was the fact that your client was a corrupting influence upon his younger brother?",
  "I doubt whether that is the key. You really think that that's the only thing the jury is going to be focused on, is who pulled the trigger? My Lord.",
  "Did the Kansas Supreme Court read these cases?",
  "How can you explain it if ­­ if indeed our prior cases are so clear on the point?",
  "They don't like the death penalty.",
  "I ­­ I suppose the issue is not what they believe, but what they said.",
  "I mean, we ­­ we ­­ we don't psychoanalyze the lower courts; we ­­ we look at what they said. And if they said that it's the Eighth Amendment, it's the Eighth Amendment.",
  "You ­­ how can you retroactively give an instruction? Right?",
  "Do ­­ do you have retention elections in Kansas?",
  "Yes. And the fact ­­ how ­­ how many people are there on death row in Kansas?",
  "Which would suggest that ­­ that Kansans, unlike our Justice Breyer, do not think the death penalty is unconstitutional and indeed very much favor it, which might suggest that a retention election that goes before such people would not come out favorably for those justices who create Kansas law that ­­ that would reverse these convictions. I'm just speculating, of course.",
  "It is such common sense that there is a maxim of interpretation that invokes it. When ­­ when somebody says interest­free loans for people with good credit, it implies that there are not interest­free loans for people who don't have good credit. Inclusio unius, exclusio alterius. And if one says there are aggravating factors and mitigating factors, and you must prove the aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, the normal understanding is you don't have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt for the mitigating factors. That's such ­­ such common reasoning that ­­ that any juror who doesn't follow it is ­­ is certainly not the typical juror, and not the person for whom the jury instructions have to be devised.",
  "I don't understand the point you're getting to. What ­­ what is your point? That this was ­­ this decision was based on State law?",
  "Of course, you know, if they didn't read our Eighth Amendment cases, maybe they also didn't read Michigan v. Long. I mean, that's entirely understandable.",
  "Don't you ­­ don't you think it's ­­ it's sort of hard to contemplate each juror ­­ each juror's ability to find mitigators on his or her own without regard to whether others find the same mitigator? Isn't that somewhat incompatible with ­­ with the juror's belief that the juror had to find it beyond a reasonable doubt? My goodness, if it's beyond a reasonable doubt, you would think every other juror would find the same mitigator, and they were expressly told that they don't have to find the same mitigator.",
  "Where are you quoting from?",
  "Oh, the Gleason.",
  "Wait. It's not a matter ­­ we're asking the factual finding of whether the mitigator existed, not weighing the mitigators against the aggravators, the factual finding of whether the mitigator existed, whether indeed this defendant had a troubled childhood or whatever else. What is the burden that the juror has to sustain in order to come to that judgment?",
  "Well, it wasn't criminal at the time. I mean, it wasn't prohibited by the Constitution at the time he was convicted, right?",
  "I thought that the ­­ the case it cited said that.",
  "I thought it cited an earlier Louisiana Supreme Court case which made it very clear that it was following the Federal rule as a matter of discretion and not because ­­ not because it had to, and it could in a later opinion decide not to follow Federal law.",
  "Well, I thought ­­ I thought it's unless they clearly state otherwise, we will assume that they're applying Federal law. And here they did clearly state otherwise. They said, we don't have to follow Federal law, but we're going to model our State law on Federal law. It seems to me that satisfies the ­­ the exception requirement of ­­ of Michigan.",
  "Well, they did say that here. They said that. This is a matter of State law; we don't have to follow Teague, but we choose to as a matter of State law. I thought that's what they said.",
  "Mr. Plaisance, on the jurisdictional point, let me see if I understand what you're arguing. A lot of State rules of procedure are modeled after Federal Rules of Procedure, and a lot of State courts simply follow the Federal Rules. But they follow it as a matter of choice and not because they think they're bound by the Federal rules. So let's say that there is a ­­ a disagreement in Federal court about what Federal Rule of Evidence 403 means. The State court says, well, you know, we're going to follow the ­­ the Federal rule, and we think that the right course as between these two divergent Federal courts of appeals is the Second Circuit. So we're going to follow the Second Circuit's interpretation of Federal Rule 403. What ­­ would we have jurisdiction to ­­ to review that decision as ­­ as a decision on a question of Federal law?",
  "They changed their mind. They have now chosen the course not to follow our jurisprudence. What forces them to stay where they were? It's a matter of State law. They've decided, we're going to change State law.",
  "Well, not yet, but if we ­­ if we agree with you and then we send it back and they look at it and they say, oh, if that's what Teague means, we're not going to follow Teague, what stops them from doing that? And doesn't that make us look foolish?",
  "That we render decisions that can be overruled by somebody else?",
  "You're ­­ you're ­­ you're saying \"hooray\" that ­­ that the Federal habeas court will thereafter be bound by it ­­",
  "­­ because the State got there first.",
  "It didn't say so, though. In ­­ in ­­ in Standard Oil, the ­­ this is a quote from the opinion: \"The relationship between Post Exchanges; and the government of the United States is controlled by Federal law.\"",
  "Well, that would have been true no matter what the State did, right?",
  "We're deciding a question of Federal law that ­­ that would have applied on its own.",
  "Well, it did. In the provision I just quoted, it said that the relationship between Post Exchanges and the government of the United States is controlled by Federal law. That's what our opinion says.",
  "Well, we weigh in when we have jurisdiction. You don't think that matters at all?",
  "Well, so what you said doesn't make much sense.",
  "Let's get in there quickly, whether we have jurisdiction or not. You're not saying that, are you?",
  "What is ­­ what is the Federal law you're talking about?",
  "Yes. That's not a Federal law, it's ­­ the Federal habeas statue is a Federal law, right?",
  "And Teague is an interpretation of that Federal law.",
  "Was that Federal law at issue in this case?",
  "Of course it wasn't.",
  "Have we ­­ have we ever said that?",
  "You want us to hold that in this case?",
  "I'm ­­ I would ­­ I would not describe changing the range of sentences available as changing the sentence.",
  "It doesn't change the sentence ­­",
  "­­ necessarily.",
  "You still get the same sentence.",
  "Is there ever a case in which the jury found aggravators and recommended the death sentence, and the judge reversed that finding?",
  "Well, I mean, either ­­ either way, is ­­ is there ­­ is there ­­",
  "­­ is there ever a case in which the jury did not find an aggravating circumstance, but the judge did?",
  "Right. But they can't recommend death unless they find the aggravator, right?",
  "All right.",
  "I'm not sure. You ­­ you ­­",
  "Are you sure that ­­ that if you have a crime that can be satisfied by various elements, the jury has to agree upon the specific element that satisfies it?",
  "I ­­ I ­­ I would think that the ­­ I would think just the opposite, that ­­that the necessity of finding the elements of the crime goes all the way back into the mists of history. And this necessity of finding an aggravator ­­ aggravating factor, we made it up, right? I mean, that's just recent Supreme Court law.",
  "And so if ­­ if even one of them should be satisfiable by simply finding the generic conclusion rather than agreeing upon the ­­ the particular species at issue, I would think it's ­­ it's ­­ it's the latter, rather than the former.",
  "Well, wait a minute. They ­­ they ­­ they require unanimity for the ­­ for a conviction, right?",
  "Just ­­ just ­­ just they don't require unanimity on the sentence. That's quite different from ­­",
  "­­ from whether the person committed the crime or not.",
  "God, I'd like to know your caveat. What is the caveat? I'm ­­ I'm on pins and needles here.",
  "But ­­ but we don't ­­ we ­­ we don't sit in judgment of ­­ of theoretical scheme that Florida has set up, do we?",
  "And don't we have to adjudge that there has been unconstitutionality in this case?",
  "That didn't happen here, did it?",
  "Good, I thought so ­­",
  "Is it clear to the jury that they are the last word on whether an aggravator exists or not?",
  "But then they're also told that the judge is ultimately going to decide whether your recommendation stands or not.",
  "But shouldn't it be clear to the jury that ­­ that their determination of whether an aggravator exists or not is final? Shouldn't that be clear?",
  "But I'm ­­ I'm talking ­­ I'm talking about what responsibility the jury feels. If the jury knows that if ­­ if ­­ if we don't ­­ if ­­ if we don't find it an aggravator, it can't be found; or if we do find an aggravator, it must be accepted. That's a lot more responsibility than just, you know, well, you know, if you find an aggravator and you ­­ you weigh it and provide for the death penalty, the judge is going to review it anyway.",
  "I find that a pretty fuzzy line, \"very direct effect.\" I ­­ it seems to me that there is a distinction between affecting retail rates, which, as Justice Kennedy has pointed out, always happens, and using ­­ using effect upon retail rates as a means of regulating wholesale rates. And the argument here is that that is what has occurred, that effectively, FERC has raised the retail price during peak hours because somebody who wants to purchase at retail during peak hours not only pays ­­ you know, has to forgo the benefit that that person would otherwise get from FERC's program. That raises the price at retail, and that is the means of achieving what FERC wants to achieve. Yes, FERC has the ­­ has the power to regulate wholesale rates. But ­­ but, the argument is, not through the fiddling around with retail rates, which is what is asserted is happening here.",
  "Oh, yes, ultimately, but the question is whether that is achieved by the means of directly managing retail rates. And you say this does not. What if FERC ­­",
  "­­ had sufficient funds available that it could pay people to not purchase electricity during peak hours? It just said, you know, we'll give you so much per day not to use more than X amount of electricity during peak hours. Would that ­­ would that be within FERC's powers?",
  "It ­­ it's the difference between turning over money to these retail purchasers and simply depriving retail purchasers of a benefit that they could otherwise obtain in the wholesale market.",
  "That ­­ that's interesting. If FERC has this power, how can it strip itself of this power by saying, we will not do this if the States don't want us to do it?",
  "That's quite different. That's quite different from saying we're going to exercise it unless you, the States, veto it. I don't know that if ­­ if FERC really has that power. I don't know how it can confer a veto upon the States.",
  "No, I think it's goes to whether FERC really thinks that it's meddling in ­­ in retail rates.",
  "That's what it goes to in my mind. I think it's an acknowledgment by FERC that, in fact, you know, we are mucking around in an area that's the State's area. And if the States don't want us to do it, we won't do it.",
  "One of the briefs, by the way, says that you had no authority to deregulate it. You know, we had a case involving the Federal Communications Commission which wanted to dispense the filing of tariffs on the part of everybody, I think, except AT&T. And we held that the statute requires the agency to regulate rates and required filed rates. Isn't that a problem here too?",
  "Yes, I'm sure you are.",
  "I mean, I like deregulated markets. But the ­­ the problem is, do you have the authority to do it?",
  "That isn't the ­­ that isn't the central conduct here. The central conduct is the refusal to buy power during peak hours. That occurs in the retail market. So why is that a direct effect? What ­­ what you're ­­ what you're telling people is, if you agree not to buy power at retail during certain hours, we're going to pay you. I ­­ that seems to me an indirect effect, not a direct effect.",
  "Excuse me. I think moving directly to control retail prices, subsidizing certain retail purchases, that also would directly affect the wholesale rate. And ­­ and does that mean FERC is authorized to do that?",
  "Why ­­ why ­­ why aren't all the companies in agreement with you? Why are there some ­­ some private companies on the other side?",
  "But they're not all generators I don't think.",
  "Well, maybe your colleague can ­­ can answer it.",
  "And they're not regulating the rate of sales.",
  "The response was where it doesn't work, we won't use it, which I didn't find a very satisfactory response. Isn't that essentially what they said?",
  "Is there any controversy over whether the ­­ the ­­ the offer is complete relief?",

  "And that's what's being challenged here.",
  "There has to be injury, in fact, okay? It has to be attributable to the ­­ to the defendant, okay. And the court must be able to remedy it. None of those three requirements, which are the classic requirements, deals with the quite separate point of adverseness.",
  "If somebody comes in and says, yes, you've been injured, the court could provide relief, but I ­­ I agree with all of that, and here is the money.",
  "Excuse me. It ­­ it has authority to enter that even though the case is moot; right.",
  "But when there's a settlement offer which has been accepted, the court can nonetheless issue a judgment enforcing that settlement, no?",
  "Oh ­­",
  "So ­­ so even though the parties have no adverseness at all and they all agree on what the outcome should be, but we want a court to go into this matter which we've all agreed on because we want a judgment? Is ­­ is ­­ is that ­­",
  "­­ the Article III adverseness requirement?",
  "I think it's remarkable.",
  "I think you're wrong. I think if there's no standing, I don't think you get dismissed as moot. I think you get a judgment for the defendant because the plaintiff has no standing.",
  "Indeed. So ­­ so the fact that the court issues judgment has nothing to do with whether there's Article III standing, whether there's mootness or not. You can enter the judgment even though there's no Article III standing.",
  "Mr. Pincus, I would have thought that your answer to Justice Kagan would have been Congress did not identify, as the harm for which it allowed suit to be brought, misinformation. It did not. It identified as the harm the failure to follow the ­­ the procedures that it imposed upon credit reporting agencies. It said nothing about people who ­­ who have been hurt by misinformation being able to sue. It said anybody can sue who's been reported on if the agency failed to use the procedures. So in fact, Congress has not identified misinformation as a suable harm. That's not what this statute does.",
  "Isn't that your answer?",
  "Excuse me. That ­­ that would lead to the conclusion that anybody can sue ­­",
  "­­ not just somebody who ­­ whose information was ­­ was wrong.",
  "Do all of them go to accuracy, or ­­",
  "­­ do some of them go to privacy and other matters?",
  "And that would be a violation, right, if ­­ if you didn't provide that?",
  "And ­­ and presumably anybody, if ­­ if you believe Respondent, anybody who ­­ whose information is not accurate can sue to get the statutory damages for failure to provide an 800 number.",
  "By the particular violation? Injured in fact by the particular ­­",
  "Not by failure to have an 800 number, you're saying?",
  "All Congress has to do is provide for damages, right?",
  "Well ­­",
  "Well, I would think that's the particularized part.",
  "Concrete ­­ concrete has nothing to do with particularized. It means it is ­­ it is ­­ the only way to put it is an injury in fact. It's a ­­",
  "You've got to do the best you can, you know? I mean ­­",
  "I said you've got to do the best you can.",
  "The person who hires somebody, if ­­ if they all have this disclaimer, which I expect they all do, you ­­ you either go without any information or you accept one of them.",
  "I want to ask about what you think Congress did. You're ­­ you're saying it's limited to ­­ to people about whom false information has been given. Suppose Congress enacts a statute that says everybody has a right to sue for exorbitant expenditures by the Department of Defense. This affects everybody, you know, the $900 toilet seat and so forth. Everybody can sue. That clearly would not be allowable. But suppose somebody is a ­­ a disappointed bidder for the toilet seat, and he sues under that statute. And he said, oh, yes, the statute didn't ­­ didn't just say the disappointed bidders can sue, or that anybody who's proximally affected can sue. It said that everybody can sue. But I, in fact, have been proximally injured, and therefore, I ought to be able to sue. Do you think that would be true?",
  "Well, why is this case any different? You're ­­ you're saying only people who have been injured, assuming that ­­ that false information is injury ­­ only they can sue. But the statute doesn't say that only they can sue. It says that everybody about whom Spokeo did ­­ did a report can sue.",
  "Right.",
  "That's fine.",
  "Where do you get the ­­ the necessity of injury in fact?",
  "Where do you get the necessity that there has been false information which you assert is there?",
  "Procedures to ensure maximum. That doesn't mean there has to be accuracy.",
  "But that wouldn't be true. You could fail to ­­ to follow the procedures and still come up with accurate information, like you could not have an 800 number.",
  "It's impossible to read it that way because it's simply not true.",
  "Excuse me. How does it follow from the common law of defamation? I mean, you ­­ you could not bring a defamation action because somebody said something false about you. It was either in one of those areas where it is presumed to be damaging, you know, such as it's, you know, about your moral life or something like that, or ­­ or your incompetence in your profession, or else you had to show positive damage. How can you say ­­",
  "­­ that it's from common law.",
  "Oh, I see. Okay.",
  "Close enough. Okay.",
  "What ­­ what happened to \"concrete and particularized\"?",

  "Say it again.",
  "The statute we're dealing with here treats everybody about whom false information has been given as somebody about whom false information that harms him has been given.

So if we reverse that decision, we ­­ we tell the Georgia Supreme Court, you're wrong; there is an arguable basis for your accepting review. So we ought to remand to that court, requiring them to accept review, it would seem to me. How can we reverse them on ­­ on an issue they ­­ they never considered?",

  "Yes, but all ­­ all I'm saying ­­ and you seem to be agreeing ­­ is that it is not the overall Batson judgment that's before us but rather the judgment that the ­­ that the new evidence did not suffice to create a Batson violation where none existed before.",
  "Are certified questions available in Georgia? Could ­­ could we certify a question to the Georgia Supreme Court?",
  "Well, I ­­ I suppose that ­­ that ­­ that a court could have a discretionary view but could provide by rule that, in the exercise of our discretion, we will grant any of these unless it's patently wrong.

  "I mean, it's harder. It's harder, not impossible, but harder.",
  "I ­­ I don't understand what you've just said. Say it again.",

You're saying that the ­­ what ­­ the Illinois Supreme Court thought the opinion below was, was that the judge didn't think eyewitness testimony proved that this was the guy who ­­ who hit him with a baseball bat. But nonetheless, he thought this guy was a drug dealer and that will be enough. I ­­ that doesn't make any sense. The trial court must have accepted the credibility ­­",
  "­­ of one or both of ­­ of the witnesses.",
  "Mr. Crooks, let ­­ let me ask you this: You fail to object to the erroneous use of the ­­ of the Guidelines. If you had objected, what would the situation be? You would have to establish that the error was not harmless, or the ­­ the government would have to establish that it was harmless, right? Would there be a presumption of nonharmlessness?",
  "To show that the error was harmless is the same as saying there is a presumption that it wasn't harmless.",
  "That's ­­ that's not the ­­",
  "­­ not the way I normally talk. I would normally say the burden ­­ the burden of establishing it is on the government, but I wouldn't say there's a presumption.",
  "The government is wrong.",
  "Where have we done that before? I mean, we had dictum in United States v. Olano, which said that there may be a special category. There may be a special category of forfeited errors that can be corrected, regardless of their effect on the outcome. But this issue need not be ­­ be addressed. And you're saying ­­ and we have not found any such category in the past. You're saying you ­­ we have finally ­­ finally discovered one category that meets that dictum in Olano.",
  "That's more important? That the lower courts have established the law for us?",
  "It seems to me we establish the law, and we have never found anything to come within that language in Olano. And it's dictum, and maybe it's wrong.",
  "What good does it do to say that the Guidelines are advisory, which is what we have held, if, when you mistake them or when you don't apply them properly, you automatically get a reversal, which is what you're arguing here? Does that sound like an advisory Guideline?",
  "Let's factor in the fact that you did not object. Surely ­­ surely there ought to be a penalty for that. We don't treat cases where there has been an objection the same as we treat cases where ­­ where there has not been. Sending it back makes total sense when there is an objection that's ­­ that's wrongfully denied.",
  "But ­­ but where you or defense counsel has, in effect, assisted the Court's error, it seems to me we demand more.",
  "It's not a matter of punishing the lawyer, is it? It's a matter of establishing a system ­­",
  "­­ that induces lawyers to make objections when objections are proper and ­­ and not to mousetrap the ­­ the Court into ­­ into error by ­­ by not ­­ by not objecting.",
  "What are the other two elements that you think serve that purpose?",
  "But what are the second and fourth prongs?",
  "Well, that's no big deal. It ­­ that doesn't satisfy my problem.",
  "It's ­­ it's not enough that the lawyer did not intentionally do it. We ­­ we demand of lawyers that they do it. They're supposed to assist the Court. And where the objection has not been made, it's ­­ it's an entirely different case when it comes up here.",
  "What the ­­ you think the two are equivalent? A risk and a probability are ­­ are interchangeable? We're ­­ we're ­­ we're going to change our ­­ our law now, so that plain error is overcome by just a significant risk?",
  "No, but ­­ but ­­ but you've accepted it.",
  "You seem to say that significant risk and reasonable probability are one and the same. I don't think they're one and the same at all.",
  "You know, we ­­ we had a case. I don't remember the case name. I think it dealt with Lampf, which ­­ which ­­ in which our Court had come to a surprise decision which shortened what everybody thought had been the statute of limitations for certain securities actions. Congress passed a law trying to reverse our decision. It said anybody who had filed the security action prior to the date of this decision would be allowed to refile and proceed to judgment. We went through a lot of trouble to say that Congress can't do that because it is reversing the outcome of a court judgment. It would have been so easy to decide that case by saying, my Lord, it's just referring to particular cases.",
  "Where do you get the notion that Congress can only act by generality? It acts all the time on individual matters. I mean, certainly, you know, grants certain privileges and certain monies on the basis of individual cases.",
  "Why is that? So long as it is not overturning a judgment that the court has made in that case, as it did in Lampf or whatever the name ­­ was it Plaut? I don't think it was Plaut.",
  "I ­­ I wrote it. I just don't remember. Do you know how many cases I've written? So long as it doesn't overturn the judgment of the court, you have to be relying on the fact that it cannot act individually. Is it magic that it ­­ that the individualized law that it enacts happens to affect a particular case? Why is that magic?",
  "There's no lawsuit. There's no lawsuit yet.",
  "By \"one case,\" you mean not ­­ not one filed case?",
  "For ­­ for one ­­ one ­­",
  "­­ person?",
  "Well, there's no lawsuit yet. If you limited it to lawsuit, I'd understand what you're saying. But you're appealing to a much more general proposition, which is that Congress cannot act individually. It must enact general laws. And I just don't agree with that.",
  "I don't ­­ no. I'm sorry.",
  "What about the Equal Protection Clause?",
  "It does say that. But why has the United States never done this before? That's what troubled me about the case. You know, when 230 years have gone by and never before has the government done something like this. I wonder, you know, maybe Congress didn't think it had the power to do it.",
  "Doesn't name ­­ doesn't name a particular case and say for purposes of that case ­­",
  "­­ the law will be thus and such.",
  "Do you have a single case where ­­ where Congress has ever done that?",
  "You think that two ­­ one case ­­ is it one case or 17 cases or 34 cases? What is ­­ what is your position?",
  "17 would be okay?",
  "Limited ­­ limited category. Okay. So a hundred cases ­­",
  "­­ is a limited ­­ is a limited category, right?",
  "Yes.",
  "Has to be a single defendant?",
  "If there are a hundred different defendants, it's okay.",
  "Yes.",
  "That doesn't mean it couldn't. That doesn't mean it couldn't change the law. Is it essential to your case that we recognize Puerto Rico as a sovereign?",
  "That's our usual double jeopardy law, isn't it?",
  "­­ two sovereigns, it's a different matter.",
  "Aren't there territorial legislatures?",
  "What's the difference?",
  "Why ­­ why can't you say the laws they enact have as their source the ­­ the people of the territory?",
  "Bartkus.",
  "Mr. Landau, I'm not sure you answered my question about why territorial legislatures are different.",
  "If you say that the issue is the source of the law in question, it seems to me that the territorial legislature is as much the source of a law as is the legislature of Puerto Rico.",
  "Take your time.",
  "Who said this? This is the UN?",
  "Who ­­ who is \"we\"?",
  "Who's we?",
  "The President said that?",
  "Suppose Congress could also say, could it not, that ­­ in its criminal code, that if a crime has been prosecuted and under Puerto Rican law it will not be ­­ the same ­­ the same crime will not be prosecuted under Federal law?",
  "Couldn't it say that if it wanted to?",
  "No ­­ well, but ­­ no, certainly Congress cannot ­­ cannot deny double jeopardy effect to something that would be double jeopardy, but I'm talking about a statute that says, even though it might have double jeopardy effect, we say ­­ we say no.",
  "Well, it's not a matter of what the Fifth Amendment permits. Congress just says, we will ­­ the Justice Department will not prosecute a crime that has already been prosecuted in ­­ in Puerto Rico.",
  "No, no, I understand that.",
  "I'm just saying, if you like that result, it can be done by the statute.",
  "I'm trying to be helpful.",
  "He wasn't associating with anybody any more ­­ any more than he was speaking. He was doing neither one.",
  "He was associate ­­ associating with his mother, I suppose, in picking up the sign for her. But he was not expressing any political view. He was not associating with a political party. What case of ours vindicates the right that ­­ that Justice Kennedy described to you and which you readily agreed with? What ­­ what case of ours vindicates that ­­",
  "Elrod ­­",
  "Elrod says you have a First Amendment right to favor a political party or not favor a political party, and you cannot be fired for doing so. That's not what happened here.",
  "Exactly. He was not expressing any First Amendment view whatever. I mean, he was fired for the wrong reason, but there's no constitutional right not to be fired for the wrong reason. If he was fired because his ­­ his ­­ his ­­ his government employer thought he had committed a felony and he hadn't, he might ­­ he might have a cause of action under some statute. But there ­­ there ­­ there's no constitutional right not to be fired for the wrong reason, and that's what happened here.",
  "Where do we say that? We never said that. Elrod and ­­ and Branti are ­­ are cases decided under the First Amendment. The First Amendment guarantees the right to freedom of speech and freedom of association. Your client was neither speaking nor associating. So how could he possibly have a cause of action under the First Amendment?",
  "What ­­ what is the New Jersey Act? That's a strange act. It protects State employment only against First Amendment violations?",
  "I can't imagine that. It must ­­ it must have other protections for State employee ­­ employees.",
  "How does it read? You have to violate the Federal constitution to get relief under New Jersey law?",
  "Yeah. That's what 1983 says. What is ­­ what does New Jersey law say?",
  "What does the New Jersey law say? You brought it up. I didn't bring it up. What does it say?",
  "So it says ­­ it says if you violate ­­ you can't fire a State employee in violation of the Federal constitution. That's what the New Jersey law says. What a strange law.",
  "All of those things would be true if the mayor gave a speech saying I am going to fire anybody who's not a Republican. All of those things would be true. Would it chill people ­­ blah blah blah ­­ would there be a cause of action? Would anybody have a cause of action because of that speech?",
  "Yeah, just the speech. He hasn't fired anybody. He's just said I am going to fire anybody who's not a Republican, or anybody who's not a Republican will not get promoted.",
  "Does anybody have a cause of action for that?",
  "Exactly. So ­­ so what counts is whether action was taken for a particular reason, not whether you chilled ­­ whether you chilled people, which you're arguing to us is this is unconstitutional because it chills other people. That ­­ that doesn't ­­ that just doesn't carry water.",
  "You say in all of those cases, no First Amendment right was being exercised, right?",
  "Is that your point?",
  "Was it clear that they hadn't?",
  "Was it clear that they hadn't?",
  "Yeah. I thought in all of these cases up to now, whenever anybody's fired, demoted, or even not promoted, it hurts and ­­ and you want to bring a lawsuit sometimes. Up to now, those lawsuits would have to show I was asserting a First Amendment right, and it's for that reason that I was not promoted. But what you're saying is, you don't have to show that at all. All you have to assert is that the reason I was not promoted was that the ­­ the employer believed that I was thus and so or not thus and so. You don't have to show any assertion of a First Amendment right. You just show that the ­­ the employer liked Republicans, and that's enough.",
  "I mean, that's a good idea, maybe. And maybe ­­ maybe it should be in some civil service act, but where do you find it in the First Amendment?",
  "Those ­­ those statutes focus on the employer. The employer cannot discriminate on the basis ­­",
  "­­ of sex.",
  "And that employer was doing that. The First Amendment does not focus on the government; it focuses on the citizen. The citizen has a right to free speech and free association.",
  "That's the difference between the two cases.",
  "Or ­­ or you could say that the law is passed by Congress but vetoed by the President, is there a violation of the Constitution?",
  "It ­­ it is bizarre. And do ­­ do you really believe, Mr. Goldstein, that the Constitution does not solve all problems? You ­­ you ­­",
  "­­ made a statement to that effect. You really believe that?",
  "It doesn't solve every problem.",
  "Do you know of any case in which we have relied on chilling effects where what was at issue was a one­off like this one as opposed to a ­­ a general policy which had a chilling effect? I don't know of any case.",
  "At common law, the trustees could sue, couldn't they?",
  "And these trustees could not sue, could ­­ can they?",
  "Because of a new creature created by Maryland law.",
  "So who ­­ who owns ­­ who owns these assets under Maryland law? Is it the trustees, or is it this ­­ this new corporation­type entity?",
  "That's the entity that can sue, and I assume that that's the entity that owns the property.",
  "And ­­ and the trustees are sort of in the position of managers ­­",
  "­­ just ­­ just as though you ­­ you hired a ­­ a CEO.",
  "It can be owned by the entity?",
  "Or ­­ or the trustees.",
  "That was a trustee who had the authority to sue, right, in the trustee's own name?",
  "And that's not the case here.",
  "How many are there in this one?",
  "Is that ­­ you know, how ­­ how many are ­­ are there normally in these special Maryland trusts?",
  "At least a hundred.",
  "Do you know of any that ­­ that are more than a thousand?",
  "Really?",
  "Well, maybe that's a problem for ­­ for Congress as ­­ as the problem of corporations was. You know, Congress adopted a special rule for corporations, and maybe it ought to adopt a special rule for real estate investment trusts.",
  "I ­­ I don't ­­ who ­­ who ­­ who was the party? Who was the defendant in that case?",
  "You say the trustees were not a party?",
  "You separate the board of trustees from the ­­ from the trustees?",
  "Is ­­ is that standard with ­­ with common law trusts? Can you sue either the trustees or the board of trustees?",
  "When you have a bunch of trustees, aren't they normally referred to as the board of trustees?",
  "There's a special statute that ­­ that allowed the board of trustees ­­",
  "So it ­­ it ­­ it may well be, you think, that the Federal government would have authority to do this in the exercise of its navigational servitude even though it doesn't have authority to do it, as you assert, under the Park Service?",
  "Okay. Do ­­ do we have to resolve the further question? Whether if the Park Service can't do it somebody else can do it?",
  "Let's ­­ and EPA might ­­ might be able to prohibit boating, no?",
  "Or environmental ­­",
  "What are ­­ what are you quoting from? I'm ­­",
  "Yes, but holding title to that is different from holding title to the water.",
  "And you're ­­ you're telling us that the river, that the government holds title to the river. It doesn't. It has usufructuary rights in the river.",
  "That's different from holding title to the water.",
  "Let's ­­ let's talk about your authority. I don't even get to the second sentence. I just get to the first sentence. The authority of the Park Service comes from the statute which authorizes the Secretary of Interior to, quote, \"prescribe such regulations necessary or proper for the use and management of system units, including those concerning boating and other activities. Only here the CSU's are park system units.\" That's 13.013(c). As a result, non­Federal holdings unambiguously fall outside the scope of the Secretary's authority because of the first sentence. \"Only those lands within the boundaries of any conservation system unit which are public lands as such term is defined in this Act shall be deemed to be included as a portion of such unit.\" If it's not within the unit, it's not within the basic authority of the Park Service to issue regulations, period. So you ­­ you have to show that ­­ I think the Federal government holds title to the water. I don't think you can show. Nobody holds title to the water.",
  "You say this grant of authority in (b). You're quoting from the regulations ­­",
  "­­ right from the statute.",
  "What are you quoting from?",
  "7a? You're saying it's on page 7a?",
  "That's 54 U.S.C. 107 ­­ 100751. It's a regulation. It's not ­­",
  "It's not the numbering. It's ­­ it says regulations ­­ oh, I see.",
  "The statute is addressing regulations.",
  "That's the subtitle in the statute.",
  "More broadly? Interpret necessary or proper ­­ necessary or proper to mean necessary or proper? You think it's beyond belief that you're going to do that?",
  "100751 is a general statute; it applies everywhere, right?",
  "And ­­ and 3101, Section 103 is specific to Alaska, isn't it?",
  "Isn't there a general rule that the specific governs the general?",
  "So this general provision is limited by what Congress has said about Alaska. And that sentence says, \"Only those lines within the boundaries of any CSU which are public lands shall be deemed to be included as a portion of such unit.\"",
  "And if you read that back into 100751, it seems to me the Park Service doesn't have jurisdiction.",
  "It's a different Congress. I mean, to say, you know, a later Congress did thus and so, and therefore the earlier Congress, when it enacted a particular statute, must have diminished. That doesn't make any sense.",
  "And ­­ and ­­ and moreover, if ­­ if the third factor is dispositive, as ­­ as you assert, you would not ­­ we would not need the ­­ the ­­ the de facto diminishment doctrine whereby, by a sort of, you know, adverse possession, a jurisdiction, whether it's Indians or ­­ or even a State that used to have a jurisdiction over a particular area has forfeited it by long­, long­accepted usage to the contrary. If ­­ if that is true and ­­ and if ­­ if the third factor is as important as you say, we would not need that doctrine. We ­­ we would just find diminishment.",
  "As far as ­­",
  "But that's not what you're arguing here. I ­­ I ­­ I understand you're arguing diminishment, not ­­ not adverse possession, so to speak.",
  "What about municipalities? What about self­governing ­­ or more or less self­governing municipalities? Are there any of those within this area?",
  "What ­­ would happen to them? Would they continue to ­­ to exist?",
  "Why would they continue to exist? I mean, aren't they creatures of the State? Can the State create municipalities on Indian Reservations?",
  "Counsel, do you agree that City of Sherrill did nothing more than deny particular equitable relief and did not repudiate the proposition of Indian sovereignty over the land in question? Because if you agree with that, then I guess I'm more inclined to give greater weight to the third factor. But if you disagree with it, as I think you ought to, then ­­ then I don't see why we need the third factor.",
  "Yes, but it says the Tribe doesn't have sovereignty, is what it says.",
  "That's right.",
  "To say ­­ to say that the Tribe does not have sovereignty.",
  "Did ­­ did ­­ did we cite Solem in Sherrill? I ­­ I don't really recall.",
  "If it held that, it would have been ­­ it would have been cited and Sherrill would not have been any big deal.",
  "I thought Sherrill was a big deal.",
  "Justice Ginsburg wrote it. I think she thought it was a big deal.",
  "Couldn't the Tribe enact ordinances that govern the Indians in the ­­ in the western part?",
  "Okay. But at least as to Tribal members in the west ­­",
  "­­ they would be subject to the Tribe's jurisdiction which they otherwise would not?",
  "I don't understand that. Try ­­ try it again.",
  "Principles of equity do not apply here?",
  "Why not?",
  "Frankly, I'm more ­­ I'm more inclined to vote your way if the City of Sherrill does apply than if the City of Sherrill doesn't apply. What you're telling me is, unless you get there through Solem, it doesn't matter whether the State and non­Indians have for generations viewed this land as their own. That's what you're telling me, right?",
  "That's not what city ­­ that's not what Sherrill said. Sherrill said the Tribe had no jurisdiction. It said it had no sovereignty over the area anymore.",
  "That determines the meaning of the 1882 statute.",
  "That's what I think.",
  "What about Sherrill?",
  "What about Sherrill?",
  "Excuse me. Wouldn't ­­ wouldn't the latter be the case with respect to any municipality that's within a reservation? We've been told there are a lot of those. And ­­ and wouldn't that ­­ wouldn't that be a problem in all of those, being that you have overlapping jurisdiction of Tribal police and municipal police? And until you know who the perpetrator is, you don't know which one has jurisdiction.",
  "Say it again? What is the common ground?",
  "Well then, this is not really a very significant case, is it? Because I presume that these enterprises that agglomerate claims and bring suit as a collection agency, they could simply get their compensation, instead of by way of, of a flat fee, by, you know, claiming entitlement to 2 percent of the rewards. So it's no big deal, I mean, really.",
  "Go ahead, I'm sorry.",
  "What if all of the claimants assign their claims to something called an agglomeration trust and the -- the person who's bringing suit here brings it as a trustee? He has no interest in it personally and he is compensated the same way, the same way this agglomerator is compensated. He has no personal interest. He could sue, couldn't he?",
  "So once again, it's no big deal. I mean --",
  "What do you do about -- about aggregated plaintiffs who are not in the field of Federal regulation? They're just sort of out of luck? Can they petition for the creation of an FCC that they can take their claims to? I mean, this is a fluke that there happens to be this Federal agency they could have gone to. Certainly our principles of standing should not depend upon that fluke, should it?",
  "But also not one in which the issue of standing was raised and decided. And our jurisprudence says that where we do not address the issue of standing the case has no precedential value on the subject.",
  "Well, we don't count the lower courts.",
  "What's the earliest of those cases in our Court?",
  "The earliest case in our Court that upholds this that, without specifically addressing the standing issue, gives judgment?",
  "In Vermont Agency, in the Vermont Agency case, which dealt with qui tam, that many people, including the Justice Department, thought did not confer Article III standing, we held to the contrary that it did confer Article III standing, mainly because it had been around forever. It was -- it was the understood part of the judicial power when the Constitution was adopted. Do you have any case prior to 1920 in which English courts or even early American courts thought that this, that this would be sufficient to bring a lawsuit?",
  "Sure, but --",
  "It's more than a wrinkle. The assignee keeps the money.",
  "What's the earliest Federal court case you have?",
  "Late 19th century?",
  "I was under the same misimpression, I have to say, and I wrote it.",
  "I must say we seem to have come full circle from Flash v. Cohen, which said that the doctrine of standing had nothing whatever to do with Article III. That it all -- the only thing it's there for is to assure that concrete adverseness on which our adversary system depends. You've come full circle from that to now your argument that concrete adverseness doesn't matter at all.",
  "Is there a combination of the two that's possible, that maybe one of the elements of Article III standing is that both parties have a stake in winning and losing?",
  "Except for counterclaims. He says I have some counterclaims.",
  "Mr. Englert, is this one lawsuit or 1,400 lawsuits, or however many clients you have?",
  "How can it be -- how is it one lawsuit when there are, I mean, just a lot of different individual claims? You think you could have brought this as a class action?",
  "They opposed it on what seems to be a reasonable ground, that each of these claims is quite different. There are different calls, different -- different amounts owing. Each case is not going to be judged on the same -- on the same facts.",
  "Mr. Englert, could you --",
  "Mr. Englert, can you explain to me again how it is that when you acquire 14 separate choses in action, 14 separate claims, against the same defendant, just by your acquiring them they sort of melt into one cause of action. How does that -- how does that happen?"
