  "Do you think that's something that Congress intended when they adopted this, to allow a State to rule out hydroelectric power?",
  "Well, suppose --",
  "-- you have a facility that produces adverse environmental effects in one State, but produces power for a number of adjoining States. Why does it make sense for the State in which the facility is located to do the balancing of the environmental and the power considerations in that situation?",
  "But is it your argument that the State's evidence can't be considered at all, or that it can't be given more than a certain amount of weight? And if it's the latter, where do you draw the line?",
  "Yes, but the State doesn't go that far. If it doesn't require the defendant to persuade the judge of the defendant's likely innocence, then there's no constitutional violation. If the -- if the rule of State law simply requires a consideration of the strength of the prosecution evidence in relation to the defense evidence, that's -- that's all right?",
  "But where is the line? That's what I'm trying to get at. If it's -- if the rule is that the defendant has to raise a reasonable inference of innocence and you take into account the strength of a prosecution's case in making that determination, you don't just accept the defense evidence and -- and see whether -- how -- how strong an inference of innocence it would raise if it's believed. I mean, where is the line?",
  "And that would be unconstitutional as well.",
  "That makes it sound like it can't be considered at all.",
  "But there wasn't much evidence against him other than the forensic evidence. Isn't that right? There's just some people who saw him nearby.",
  "Right.",

  "Just take, for example, the -- the palm print. The chief Mobley said he found it in -- in the apartment, and that would be very strong evidence, if in fact that was the case. But his credibility was contested. So how can you conclude that the palm print is strong evidence for the prosecution without implicitly making a determination, a credibility determination?",
  "But then the court is making --",
  "-- the court is excluding defense evidence based on a finding that a prosecution witness is credible.",

  "Are you --",

  "So really, your test is any evidence that's -- any statement made to the police or -- is an -- is testimony.",
  "Any relevant evidence given to law enforcement is testimonial.",

  "Well, what is it?",
  "How do you go about determining whether something falls within somebody's job duties? How specifically does that have to be set out?",

  "But isn't there this -- isn't there this anomaly in the position that you're advocating? It would seem to me that categories of employee speech that are most likely to be disruptive would be public speech that's outside of the employee's duties, or internal speech that is outside of the employee's duties. How much of a -- of a problem is it that employees are bringing First Amendment claims based on largely internal speech that falls within their own job duties?",
  "But are these going to be difficult cases under Pickering balancing? You have the case like this, where the employee, let's say, says to the prosecutor, \"I think the case should be dismissed.\" The prosecutor says, \"Well, I'm the supervisor, and I disagree. We're not going to dismiss the case.\" Typically, the employee wouldn't be disciplined for doing something like that. Now, if the employee persists and, you know, is insubordinate, there would be another basis for taking disciplinary action.",

Aren't they going to -- aren't these cases going to cause terrible litigation problems?",

  "If Pickering balancing is done, is there anything special about the situation where the employee's speech is part of the employee's job duties? Is the test applied differently in that",
  "No, I'm not sure I understood that answer. So, in this situation, if the employer said that Mr. Ceballos was performing his job poorly, that would be enough to tip the balance in the employer's favor --",

Why doesn't that encompass any claim that he might want to make later on?",
  "I mean, criminal litigation review after the final decision is the general rule. There generally is not any interlocutory -- any interlocutory appeal. And what you say could happen in any criminal case if you assume bad faith on the part of the people who are responsible for making the decisions along the way. They could delay indefinitely and postpone the entry of a final decision.",
  "But is it clear that the --",

  "Then why should we -- why should there be review, before trial, of a charge that could be amended?",
  "There could be additional charges added by the time there's a final decision.",

  "Well, that wouldn't be --",
  "Well, did you ask for any remedy in this case other than suppression? This arose on the motion to suppress, am I right?",
  "Well, that, Mr. -- could your client's attorney have argued in the Virginia habeas proceeding that his procedural default should have been excused because of ineffective assistance of trial counsel at the time of the default?",
  "That may or may not have been ineffective assistance of counsel. But I don't understand why -- if a jurisdiction in this country has a procedural default rule that can be overcome by a showing of cause and prejudice with ineffective assistance of counsel being cause, why isn't that a remedy that is sufficient to give full effect to the treaty, which is what the treaty requires?",
  "But is there a difference between the rights that could be asserted by the consul or a consulate official and the rights that could be asserted by a criminal defendant?",
  "If the consulate official knew that a national of that country was being detained and wanted access to that person and that was being denied by -- by the State officials, there would be no remedy in Federal court?

  "Well, Congress could have -- could have said -- could have thought not only do we not want people who -- who file complaints not to suffer those things that would deter a reasonable person from filing a complaint, but we just don't want them to suffer at all for having engaged in this protected activity.",
  "What -- what basis would there be for deciding that Congress had one policy objective as opposed to the other there?",
  "What does -- what does material mean?",
  "Let's say a new case comes up tomorrow and the person is charged in an information with assault in the second degree, and it's clearly alleged in the information that a firearm was used. But then when the case is submitted to the jury, the judge just forgets to charge on the firearm factor or element. Would that -- could that be harmless error? Is that any different from the case that's before us?",
  "Well, it's a different -- is it a materially different case?",
  "Is it just like Neder, or is it different from Neder?",
  "You keep saying a lesser offense and a greater offense, but under Washington law, there's just one offense. Isn't that right? It's second -- it's assault in the second degree.",
  "Well, why would it be easier than in Strickland? In the -- in the case of ineffective assistance of counsel, you have a very focused inquiry, but in this situation, how are you going to -- how can a judge assess, after the fact, whether the strategy that was pursued was inferior to another strategy that's -- that -- that allegedly would have been pursued if the first-choice attorney had been selected? Or maybe even more difficult, how can a judge assess whether the attorney who ended up representing the defendant was in some way less skillful than the attorney that the -- the defendant preferred to have? That seems like a very difficult determination to make.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, can there not be a case where it's clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the -- the judge's mistaken ruling on a disqualification motion didn't have any effect on the outcome?",
  "Well, let's say the defendant wanted to be represented by a relative whose -- whose specialty is real estate, and for some reason, that lawyer is wrongfully disqualified. And so then the defendant ends up with a very experienced criminal practitioner with a national representation -- a national reputation, and still the defendant is convicted. Could that not be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt?",
  "Would your -- would your rule --",
  "Would your rule apply in the case of a guilty plea?",
  "Well, your comment about the defendant running out of a funds is -- raises a good point. So the remedy would be an automatic reversal in a case like that where the defendant would be represented by appointed counsel?",

  "What do you mean --",
  "If the judge, when he finally found the defendant competent, had said expressly, and I -- I made this determination in my mind shortly after the hearing and the -- the briefs that were submitted at that time, but now I'm putting it on the record, that wouldn't be sufficient?",
  "Where does the act say that, that there has to be a finding at the time?",
  "No. But there's no provision, is there, that says that the finding under (b)(4), that there has to even be a finding under (b)(4), much less when the finding has to be made?",
  "As you --",
  "Under your reading of 1415, may a court award to parents any costs that they incur in connection with the litigation, or -- or would you just add expert fees to the attorneys' fees?",
  "But if costs is not a term -- is not a legal term of art, if it really -- if it means just the expenses that parents incur, why wouldn't it include things like travel expenses or lost wages to attend the court proceeding?",
  "Well, speaking of that -- of that language, that attorneys' fees may be awarded as part of costs, does that suggest -- it doesn't say directly that costs may be awarded. Does that suggest that the attorneys' fees are simply to be regarded as another element of costs that -- that may be awarded under the costs statute?",
  "Well, is a State required to adopt any particular mens rea for murder? Is there a constitutional requirement as to the minimum mens rea that can be -- can be set for the offense of murder?",
  "Was it a reasonable question whether he knew it was a police officer or whether he knew it was a human being?",
  "But aren't you -- aren't you urging a very strange result that the -- the decision on the merits of the SLUSA preclusion issue should be decided by the State courts when the whole purpose of -- of that provision was to take matters out of the State courts because there was a view in Congress that they were not being handled properly there?",
  "I thought you said the merits of the issue was not going to be decided by the Federal court.",
  "When you speak about a violent situation, would that be limited -- would that apply here just because a punch was thrown, or would it be enough that the officers saw some men restraining the young man, or would it be enough if there were violent words being exchanged?",
  "Let's say they -- they see a fight going on. What kind of calculation do you think has to go on in the mind of the officer? They have to think, well, let me look at these people. Do they look like they're -- they're strong enough to really hurt each other? How likely is it that they're going to grab some object that's lying around, a knife, a baseball bat, or something, and -- and escalate the violence? What -- what sort of thought process do you think a reasonable officer is supposed to go through in that situation?",
  "Well, was there anything in the facts that a reasonable officer would know from looking in the window to suggest that these -- the adults were not -- did not have the intention of inflicting some sort of serious injury on this young man that they were restraining?",
  "They had -- did they have any reason to know why they were holding him?",
  "Is there a difference in the moral burden on the jurors, or the psychological burden on the jurors, in the situation where they have to find that the aggravators outweigh the mitigators, and, therefore, make an affirmative finding that leads to the sentence of death, as opposed to the situation where they can say, \"We can't decide, under the applicable burden of proof, which side is weightier,\" and, therefore, they allow a default rule to dictate what the sentence is going to be?",
  "No, but if they find -- if they agree, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the aggravators and the mitigators are in equipoise, then they allow the default rule to dictate the sentence of death. Isn't that right?",
  "Would it be constitutional if the Kansas statute said that, \"The jury must find, by a preponderance, that the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors\"?",
  "And wouldn't a defendant be better off under the current Kansas statute than under a statute like that, where, under the current statute, the jury has to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the aggravating factors and the mitigating factors are at least in equipoise?",
  "Well, I mean --",
  "-- suppose the jury thinks that the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors 51-49. Now, under the first statute that I hypothesized, that would result in a verdict of death, would it not? What would the result be under the -- under the current Kansas statute, where the aggravators have to be shown, beyond a reasonable doubt, to outweigh the mitigators?",
  "Was there a particular --",
  "-- was there a reason why they provided that, in the case of equipoise, the sentence would be death? Or is that just a quirk of the way the provision was written?",
  "What's your --",
  "If the Federal Government were running this program itself, would you make the same argument?",
  "If the Federal Government were running the program itself, rather than having it -- private entities administer the program for it, would you make the same argument?",
  "Well, what is the statutory -- what is the mens rea under the statute for the offenses that the defendant was charged with? It's knowingly, isn't it?",
  "What is the -- the methodology that you think we should follow in determining where the burden should be allocated under any particular criminal statute? Is it the -- the majority rule at the time when that particular statute was enacted or at -- is it -- you don't think it's the -- the old common law rule. What -- what is the -- at what point of time do we look at the -- at what's going on throughout our country?",
  "So the burden would be different under different statutes?",
  "If we were dealing with a -- with a much older criminal statute, the burden might be allocated differently?",
  "But why would they use includes in that provision and means in other provisions?",
  "Well, do you agree that that's an exhaustive list in subsection (4)?",
  "Well, would you agree that includes is meant to be exhaustive in many of the other -- in a number of the other subsections of this definitional provision?",
  "Why shouldn't includes here be read to mean means when that seems to be the way it's used in other subsections of this provision and when the only thing that seems to be -- if this is not an exhaustive list, the only thing that seems possibly to be omitted from the list is what's involved here, which is a group consisting of a corporation or other legal -- other legal entity and -- and natural persons.",
  "Well, a State attorney -- a State attorney general wouldn't fall within subsection 10. Would -- would that be the case?",
  "Do you --",
  "Do you agree that that was not a -- that method of execution is not a violation of the Eighth Amendment?",
  "Yes.",
  "Do you know of any method that has been used -- used throughout the country that is not a violation of the Eighth Amendment?",
  "Suppose you -- suppose you never were told by Florida what the -- how exactly it was going to be done. Does that mean you never could have brought a 1983 claim even on the day -- the scheduled day of execution?",
  "Well, what do you think is the standard for determining what sort of causal connection there has to be in order to have suppression here?",
  "What's the purpose of the causal connection requirement? What's the reason for having it?",
  "And what's the reason for requiring a clear connection?",
  "But why?",
  "But why? Isn't the reason just a -- just a question of crafting an appropriate remedy for -- an appropriate deterrence --",
  "-- for violations?",
  "Well, I think you said the -- you thought the police here had to wait what? 15 seconds? What was the figure you gave?",
  "And now suppose they waited 10 seconds. And so there would be a -- a constitutional violation? Why would suppression be appropriate in that situation? Why would it be in any way proportional to the -- to the violation that occurred?",
  "Well, wherever the line is, suppose they're just -- they're just slightly on the wrong side of the line?",
  "Then you're -- you're contradicting the premise.",
  "When did the defense counsel say that this evidence did not fit within factor (k)?",
  "You said this case is different because both counsel told the jury that the evidence that you're relying on did not fit within factor (k). And I'm not sure what you're referring to.",
  "Now, as to defense counsel, are you referring to what you quoted on page 9 of your brief, where he says, \"I'm not going to insult you\" -- what you highlighted on page 9 -- \"I'm not going to insult you by telling you I think it excuses, in any way, what happened here\"? That's what you -- is that what you're referring to?",
  "Isn't he --",
  "-- saying something very different there? He isn't -- he's not saying, \"This doesn't fit within factor (k).\" And he makes no reference to factor (k). He says nothing about \"extenuating.\" He says \"excuses.\" Isn't that something very different, \"excusing\" the crime?",
  "If you had been - -",
  "-- if you were arguing this to the jury, would you have said, \"You know, my client earned a position of responsibility on the fire crew that patrolled the Sierra Foothills, and, therefore, that excuses the crime that you've found that he committed here\"?",
  "In - -",
  "In 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(B), what, in your view, does the first phrase, \"illicit trafficking in a controlled substance,\" add to the reference to a drug-trafficking crime - -",
  "-- as defined by 924(c)?",
  "But are there any trafficking offenses that would not fall within 924(c) if you define a \"trafficking offense\" that way?",
  "Well, no, there - -",
  "-- are possessory -- there are \"mere possession\" offenses that are outlawed by 924(c), but is it not the case that any -- if you interpret \"trafficking\" to mean trafficking in the way the word would be used in ordinary speech -- that any State trafficking offense you can think of would have a corresponding felony violation under the Controlled Substances Act, so that if you read the statute that way, the initial phrase is superfluous?",
  "Let me ask the same question a different way. If -- since 924(c) includes some \"mere possession\" offenses, and illicit trafficking in a controlled substance includes all violations of 924(c), doesn't that show that the way Congress used \"illicit trafficking in a controlled substance\" is not in the sense in which the term is used in ordinary speech, but's much broader, so that it can include \"mere possession\" offenses?",
  "You think there's a uniform Federal definition of a theft offense?",
  "There's -- they'll -- there's no variation in State offenses that would fall within that, a theft offense?",
  "But your argument seems - -",
  "-- to be based on their having implicitly given up their right to sue. Isn't that right? That was your main argument. This is a settlement. This is in the nature of the settlement. As part of the bargain, the patent holder promises not to sue for infringement.",
  "But in answer to the hypotheticals, you seem to say it wouldn't matter if they explicitly did not give up their right to sue. So, what is left of this argument that what's involved here is essentially a settlement?",
  "Isn't the most likely answer that they just -- they saw a small problem, and they rendered a decision on the small problem, and they didn't think about it any further than that?",
  "Going forward, if we - -",
  "-- if we agree with your position, the result will be that there will be a 7-year limitations period for oil and gas leases, but, for Indian claims and for minerals, there'll be no statute of limitations?",
  "Did they - -",
  "When they enacted the 7-year limitation period, did they explain why they would treat those two situations so differently?",
  "Are you saying that this doesn't apply to any administrative proceeding, or just those that are structured like this one, where you don't have anything that's labeled a \"complaint\"?",
  "Is the question whether instruction 13 is flawed viewed in isolation, or whether it is flawed when it's viewed together with the instruction on employer negligence?",
  "But do you agree that they set out different causation standards, 12 and 13?",
  "So if the causation standards are in fact the same, then instruction 13 is defective; isn't that right?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, this touches on what troubles me about this. I wonder whether we can answer the generic question that you presented, whether the omission of an element of a criminal offense from the indictment can constitute harmless error, without considering the nature of the alleged defect here. I don't know how you can answer -- if you look at whether the alleged defect here is susceptible to harmless error analysis, or whether if we were to agree with you, in fact, it is harmless, how you can answer those questions without reaching a conclusion about whether there was any defect in the indictment in the first place.",
  "And it doesn't seem to me that there's any defect in this indictment. It charges -- it recites the language of the statute, it uses the word \"attempt\" which has a very well-settled meaning in the law. Any lawyer would understand exactly what is required for an attempt. It sets out the factual basis of the charge. So I don't know how you would get to the -- how you can answer the second question without getting into the first question.",
  "If you went back to the - - if you went back to the very demanding nineteenth century criminal pleading laws, criminal pleading laws, they would say that where you use a legal term that has a well-0established meaning such as attempt, you don't need to spell out the definition of that, of that concept. It's enough to use the term. So what the Ninth Circuit has done is to resurrect, you know, to go back to something that's more demanding than would have been required in a nineteenth century indictment and frame that as a violation of the Fifth Amendment.",
  "How far would you go with the Mechanik logic? Suppose that someone is charged by information with a felony without the person's consent and for some reason the trial judge refuses to dismiss the information and then the person is convicted. Would you say that because the petit jury returned a verdict that the fact that the person was charged with a felony by information calls for no remedy?",
  "What if it's perfectly - -",
  "I'm sorry. What if it's perfectly clear that the error is simply a clerical error? Let's take a case where somebody is charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. And before the grand jury, we look at the transcript, we see that the prosecutor introduced evidence of five judgments of convictions for felony offenses. And the jury is properly charged that they have to find that this individual was a convicted felon. And there's simply -- and then when the case is tried at, when the case is tried the defense even stipulates that the person is a convicted felon. But there's a clerical mistake in preparing the indictment. And it doesn't recite the fact that the defendant was previously convicted of a felony. It's your position that there must be a reversal there?",
  "But what if it comes up on appeal? Nothing is done until it comes up on appeal.",
  "Which is exactly in the posture of this case.",
  "You think that the -- that the indictment had to specify which of the many things that he did, or the several things that he did when he approached the border constituted the overt act that the Ninth Circuit -- he walked up to the border and he did a number of things to try to get into the United States.",
  "And you think that the indictment has to specify that walking up wasn't a substantial step, but presenting the documents might have been, whether it was walking up, presenting the documents, lying to the agent? You have to go into that level of detail in order to satisfy the Fifth Amendment?",
  "And the defendant could be convicted of an attempt under such an indictment, could he not?",
  "But in that situation, you wouldn't know what the substantial step was, would you?",
  "The indictment wouldn't tell you what the substantial step was.",
  "If the defendant was convicted of the lesser included offense of attempt under an indictment charging the completed offense?",
  "I still don't understand the distinction between the California system and a system of advisory guidelines with reasonableness appellate review. Let's take a hypothetical case where the statutory range after convictions on multiple counts is zero to a hundred years. And let's say you have two judges who have these cases. And one sentences the defendant to zero, probation. The other one sentences the defendant to a hundred years. Without saying a word of explanation for either sentence, isn't the appellate court in that situation going to say, you have to tell us why you have chosen zero or why you have chosen 100? And if the trial judge provides an explanation, isn't the trial judge necessarily going to be reciting certain facts that the judge believes to be true about the offense and the offender?",
  "But isn't it reviewed for reasonableness -- isn't the reasonableness review necessarily going to require what is, in essence, fact-finding by the trial judge, and a review of the reasonableness of the sentence in light of those facts by an appellate court?",
  "Under any guideline system, whether it's mandatory or advisory, once -- if you have a mandatory system or an advisory system with appellate review, once the appellate review function has been performed, will it not be the case that trial judges will not have unfettered discretion, will have very limited discretion in choosing, making these sentencing policy determinations? That's the whole purpose of a guidelines system. That the individual trial judges don't get to decide, you know, how much deterrence they think is necessary, or how severe they think an individual crime is, that there's supposed to be some kind of uniformity.",
  "Where does it say in there that the buttons were worn every day?",
  "It says that the family members were there every day, or for many days. It doesn't say they wore the buttons every day, unless I'm missing - -",
  "In his opinion on denial of rehearing, Judge Kleinfeld on the Ninth Circuit made the point that at criminal trials -- and I suppose at other trials -- it is an accepted feature of the proceeding that there are going to be spectators who identify with one or the other party. And there may be relatives of the defendant in a criminal case. There may be relatives of the victims. And it's apparent from their behavior what they think about the case and which side should win. And that's sort of a baseline that has to be accepted in judging, not whether wearing buttons is good as a -- whether we think it would be good if we were announcing a court rule, but whether there's a violation of due process. Do you accept that?",
  "So what is it about these particular buttons that's reflected in the record that shows that it goes significantly beyond what would be inferred just from that rather common feature of trials?",
  "Why is there a greater risk? Why do the buttons convey -- involve a greater risk than the kind of behavior that Judge Kleinfeld was referring to?",
  "In this case, if Mr. Haley had said, I had some conversations with the private employer and the plaintiff's name was mentioned during the conversations, but I never told them to discharge her, would this, would that be something -- would your argument apply there?",
  "But your position is that the Attorney General's certification is conclusive - - is not conclusive in those situations in which the Attorney General doesn't draw the line properly between an event denying answer and an event characterizing answer? Whenever the Attorney General is wrong on that very nuanced decision in some instances, then the Attorney General's certification is not conclusive?",
  "But here not only, not only does it say that the Attorney General's certification is conclusive for purposes of removal, but there is no mention about remand in relation to a case that is removed after the Attorney General's certification. Whereas by contrast, where the Attorney General doesn't certify and the case is removed, the statute does address the issue of remand. So if you put those two things together, isn't it perfectly clear that Congress did not want these cases that are removed on the Attorney General's certification to be remanded?",
  "The briefs point out that a number of district courts have form complaints that are often used in these cases and that these forms call on the prisoner-plaintiff to address the issue of exhaustion. Now, do you think there's something wrong with those forms, and if a prisoner fills out the form and reveals in filling it out that a claim was not exhausted, is it improper for the district court at the screening stage to dismiss the case?",
  "If it's an affirmative defense, then why is it -- why is it proper for a district court, for a district court, to have a form that calls on the plaintiff to negate the affirmative defense?",
  "Well, what about 1997(e) and (g), which prohibits, seems to prohibit a case from getting beyond the complaint, not even to the answer unless the district court finds that the plaintiff has a reasonable opportunity to prevail on the merits. Doesn't this clearly take this out of the normal pleading procedures?",
  "If it's an affirmative defense doesn't that mean that the prisoner is going to have to file, and the individuals defendants are going to have to file an answer in every case and assert all of their defenses?",
  "Just respond, even if there is nonfrivolous, nonexhaustion argument that can be made, they are going to have to go through all of that in every instance?",
  "And what about footnote 3, on page 18(a)? On the last sentence says, if the jury cannot punish for the conduct which is harming others, then it is difficult to see why it may consider it at all.",
  "Do you think juries can, Oregon juries or juries anywhere can understand what they are told if they are told, you can take into account conduct directed at other people for the purpose of assessing how reprehensible the conduct is, but you can't punish for the harm that is caused other people?",
  "They can understand that distinction and - -",
  "And you would have them apply that principle in this case?",
  "Do you read the tolling provision in 2263(B) the same way as you read the tolling provision that's before us?",
  "Do you think Congress really wanted to have two different, entirely different tolling concepts in these provisions?",
  "Do you think the final, the judgment in the criminal case is still pending because it can be acted upon?",
  "Are you saying, are you arguing that there, during this period, there is an application for state relief pending in the state courts or that there is an application for state relief pending in this Court?",
  "Where is it pending?",
  "Where is it pending?",
  "It's a Federal writ, isn't it? It's an application for a Federal writ. It's not an appeal in state criminal -- state case.",
  "Does your argument - -",
  "Can't you make that argument about any, about cross-examination in general? It is debatable whether -- how good cross-examination is in determining the truthfulness of a witness's testimony. Now, our Constitution decides the issue one way, but any infringement of cross-examination could be susceptible to the same argument that you are making.",
  "Is there any language in 2254(d) that could incorporate the Teague exceptions?",
  "What would we say if we were to say that 2254(d)(1) accommodates the Teague exceptions, that Congress meant to put them in but just forgot to do it? How would we account for the language?",
  "Isn't that making the tail wag the dog, because there's language in the provisions on successive petitions that refers to Teague, that you would read the Teague exceptions into 2254(d)(1) when there's nothing in the language there that can be interpreted to refer to them?",
  "If they are so clear, how can you account for Mr. Reich's interpretation? He's an expert in the area.",
  "I know you say he's wrong, but if somebody in his position with his expertise can interpret the regulations in that way, doesn't that show that they're not clear on their face?",
  "Well, Mr. Flaxman, is your argument limited to that situation, where there is no evidence whatsoever against the criminal defendant other than the illegally seized evidence? Or would it apply in some situations in which there is some additional evidence?",
  "Any additional evidence, even if it would be insufficient to support a conviction, takes -- makes make this -- would make this a different case.",
  "What, what does necessarily mean? Does it mean no additional evidence? Does it mean no additional evidence that is insufficient to support a conviction? Does it mean no additional evidence that would be likely to persuade a trier of fact?",
  "Well, in this case, let me just me more question on it. In this case, suppose there had been a witness who said at about the time when this murder took place, I saw somebody who was between, I would judge as between the age of 15 and 25, average height, average build, running away. And let's say that your client fits that description. Now would that be enough to take this case out of the rule that you're arguing for?",
  "No, well -- until the trial --",
  "What does somebody like Mr. Wallace do under your rule if he's in a jurisdiction where there's not a lot of discovery in criminal cases. He isn't going to know until trial whether his cause of action accrued sometime earlier or whether it waited.",
  "If I could come back to a prior question. Unless there is some different procedure required when -- between the two situations of denial of conversion from 7 to 13 and allowing conversion but with immediate reconversion back to 7, unless there's some difference between that's required by the code in those two situations, maybe it is because you have to -- in the reconversion situation, you have to wait until the plan is filed. Maybe it's because the bad faith doesn't carry over. But unless there's some difference, I don't see what this case is about.",
  "You can't provide any reason why there's a difference between those two?",
  "You deny -- do you dispute the fact that the bankruptcy court could simultaneously convert on the motion of the debtor from 7 to 13 and during the 20-day period that's required by the rule, the rules, reconvert? Do you dispute that, for bad faith?",
  "If it gives notice and an opportunity for a hearing during the 20 day period - - you have to give 20 days notice before the conversion takes place; is that correct, from 7 to 13?",
  "If it has the hearing during that period, you don't dispute that the court could do that, or do you?",
  "Why isn't the power to reconvert sufficient?",
  "If we were looking at attempted generic burglary of a residence, wouldn't that involve conduct that presents the serious potential risk of physical injury to another?",
  "If the would-be burglar is climbing through the window or on a ladder with the intent to climb through the window, wouldn't that involve almost the same risk or maybe the same risk?",
  "Mr. Crawford, does the record show that the facts in the PSR came from police reports rather than from a plea colloquy or someplace in the court records?",
  "Where is that in the record?",
  "There are a number of Florida cases that involve open carports. How would you apply it there? Somebody, if you had a carport that's not fenced off at all, just 20 feet let's say from the street, somebody walks into the carport and steals a garden rake?",
  "So in other words, you're saying that in measuring the risk, you should consider not just what this particular defendant succeeded in accomplishing, but what the defendant was attempting to accomplish?",
  "Do you have to show that at the time when a particular paycheck in question is issued, there was an intent to discriminate?",
  "What if the situation is that when the particular paycheck is cut, the company, the employer, whoever it is, has no intent whatsoever to discriminate? They think that they are issuing this pay on a totally nondiscriminatory basis?",
  "But isn't your position that an employer violates Title VII unless the employer periodically reviews the entire pay record of every employee to make sure that there has never been an uncomplained of act of discrimination at any point in the past that would have a continuing present effect on the amount of money that the employee is paid?",
  "If the employer had a policy of paying women, all women, 20 percent less than men, and it continued that policy, surely it would know in the present day when it issued those paychecks that it was paying women less than men. So it would be intentionally discriminating at this time, wouldn't it?",
  "How could cost justify a dual pay scale?",
  "You'd have to have another factor in the decision, which was that you didn't want to change pay. But cost alone couldn't justify that.",
  "No, you'd have to say, we don't want to spend any more and we also don't want to equalize pay. You have to say the second too.",
  "If you say you're not going to equalize pay, you're saying you're going to discriminate on the basis of race.",
  "You'd certainly have a very happy work force if you equalized one way.",
  "I guess if you had just alleged the last part of paragraph 51, plaintiffs have alleged, plaintiffs allege upon information and belief, et cetera, without the detail that you provided, would that have been sufficient?",
  "But you omit all the allegations about parallel conduct and the other allegations that you think provide a basis for inferring a conspiracy from the parallel conduct, if you omit all that but you just include the last part of 51, would that be enough?",
  "What if you pled more than you had to, and it's clear from what you pled that you were drawing an implausible inference? Can't the complaint then be dismissed for failure to state a claim?",
  "Well, let's take the Form 9 where you take the form complaint for an automobile accident, and suppose what it says is, I was injured in an automobile accident at a particular place in time. I was hit by a compact car with Massachusetts plates. The defendant owns the compact car with Massachusetts plates. That's the complaint. The Court can't dismiss that for failure to state a claim when it's apparent from the face of the claim that you're, that the basis for suing the defendant is a totally implausible inference?",
  "Even if it reveals that the only basis for identifying this person as the defendant is the fact that the person has a Massachusetts license plate and a compact car?",
  "But what is the difference between asking whether something is implicit in the, in the prior art and simply asking whether it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art?",
  "Well, once you define the teaching, suggestion and motivation test that way so that it can be implicit, it can be based on common sense, I don't quite understand the difference between that and simply asking whether it's obvious. Could you just explain what that adds?",
  "Would you dispute that in some of the earlier cases, like Dembiczak with the garbage bag that looks like a pumpkin, that this TSM test was applied in a way that seemed to ask for something quite explicit in the prior art?",
  "Would your answer be the same if you added to Justice Stevens' hypothetical very high barriers of entry that would prevent other competitors from entering the market after the target was driven out?",
  "If we don't take the Brooke Group approach, is the alternative to ask the jury to do what the instructions in this case ask them to do.",
  "To decide whether Weyerhaeuser bought more logs than it needed in order to prevent its rivals from obtaining the logs that they needed at a fair price? How is a jury to, a lay jury, to decide whether a company like Weyerhaeuser bought more logs than it needed, or what is the fair price?",
  "But you think it was sufficient.",
  "You think it was sufficient enough.",
  "What does that mean? What does a fair price in this, in this context mean? Does it mean the price that's necessary in order to keep an inefficient competitor in business?",
  "But what about the recoupment prong, given that Weyerhaeuser doesn't have market power in the selling market and that mills were entering, new mills were coming on line during this period. How would you satisfy the recoupment?",
  "If you look ahead, I don't know how far imminence allows you to look ahead, but let's say we're looking at 5 years or 10 years, what particularized harm does the record show that Massachusetts will, or faces an imminent threat of suffering, that can be traceable to the reductions that you want to produce through these regulations?",
  "6 percent is the total emissions, the total contribution from motor vehicles in the United States, right?",
  "To the global. And so, the reduction that you could achieve under the best of circumstances with these regulations would be a small portion of that, would it not?",
  "If the EPA concludes that regulating an air pollutant would endanger public health and welfare, can it decline to regulate?",
  "It has to regulate even if it concludes that regulation would make things worse?",
  "Yes.",
  "Then why can't they -- what is wrong with their view that for the United States to proceed unilaterally would make things worse and therefore they're going to decline to regular for that reason?",
  "Isn't the definition of public welfare extremely broad?",
  "Could the OCC - -",
  "Sure.",
  "In real world terms, what's involved here? What are examples of some of the things that Michigan does or some other State does that impair or impede the operations to the - -",
  "Do you think your, do you think your schools as they are operated now are segregated?",
  "How do, how do you square your objective of achieving racial balance with your disinterest in the situation at Cleveland and Rainier Beach? Those are the most unbalanced schools under your definition, and yet those are not affected at all by this plan. Why, why are you not concerned about that?",
  "Are the students who are attending those schools getting the benefits of attending a school that's racially balanced? And if they're not, why are you not concerned about that, if that's an important objective of your program?",
  "Why is that a problem? Suppose you have a school in which 60 percent of the students are either of Asian ancestry or Latino ancestry, and 40 percent are white as you classify people. And there are no African-American students at all. You would consider that to be a racially balanced school, would you not?",
  "And what is the theory behind that? Is, the theory is it that the white students there or the Asian students or the Latino students would not benefit from having African-American classmates? It is enough if they have either Asian classmates or Latino classmates or white classmates? How do you -- how do square that with your, your objective of providing benefits that flow from racial balance?",
  "If we look at the things that Parents are concerned about when they're considering where their children are going to high school, we look at things like SAT scores, for example, or performance on statewide tests, would we see that, the oversubscribed schools and the undersubscribed schools have similar test scores?",
  "Well, if we looked at Garfield and Cleveland, what would we find?",
  "Well, what would this board have to have in order for it not to be temporally limited in your opinion? Any plan can be changed in the future. So why does the fact that this can be changed in the future make it a plan that has a temporal limitation?",
  "What if the defect that he identified turns out to be entirely different? What if there is no dispute, it's completely different from the defects that led to the false claims on which there were recovery?",
  "What if a particular jurisdiction has an entirely novel and fundamentally different theory of aiding and abetting? Is it simply sufficient that it is labeled aiding and abetting?",
  "So wouldn't it odd for this Court to decide that issue of California law?",
  "In order to agree with you on the accessory point, though, don't we have to decide two disputed issues of California law? Whether accessory here in this statute means accessory after the fact, and whether if somebody is charged under that statute as an accessory, that has to be alleged specifically in the indictment, or whether it is just sufficient to charge the person with the offense.",
  "Are there cases that hold that the natural and probably consequences of purchasing alcohol for a minor could be joyriding?",
  "Or anything else that somebody might do after getting intoxicated?",
  "All the local processing cases, would they have come other differently if those facilities -- the milk processing plant, the shrimp processing plant, and so forth -- had been publicly owned?",
  "But none of that -- in answer to my earlier question, I thought you said none of that really matters, right? The only thing that matters is that this is a publicly owned facility. You could be selling hamburgers or renting videos and it would come out the same way.",
  "Is that what it turns on, the motive? If the motive were to keep the jobs at the plant in New York, rather than in some facility outside of New York, that would be, that would make a difference?",
  "Does it make any difference that the review was discretionary in the Ninth Circuit? What if before the act was passed there was an appeal as of right to the Ninth Circuit? Wouldn't your argument be exactly the same?",
  "What if, what if the Ninth Circuit had incorrectly held that it had jurisdiction? Would it be the same?",
  "Well, how could the district court on remand find that there was a valid waiver when the Ninth Circuit says on A-17, the appendix to the petition, for all the foregoing reasons, Landrigan has not waived the right to assert a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel?",
  "Well, are you claiming that -- are you claiming that his attorney did not adequately represent him at the sentencing hearing with respect to the question of waiver? In other words, when -- that the attorney should have insisted that the judge go through some kind of more comprehensive colloquy with him about waiver and inform him of certain things about what he was giving up? Are you making that claim?",
  "Isn't that a separate question, whether it's a knowing and intelligent waiver? Isn't the question here whether he was prejudiced, which is a question of fact, which is a question of whether had he been informed of the possibility of mitigation evidence relating to a history of family violence, he would have persisted in blocking the admission of any mitigation evidence? Isn't that the issue? Not whether it was knowing and intelligent. That would be a separate legal question.",
  "Yes, it's a mixed question. But if the post-conviction relief court found as a matter of fact that even had he known about the possibility of this type of mitigation evidence, he would have persisted in refusing to cooperate -- if there was such a finding, and know you dispute it -- and if you were granted a hearing, is it not true you would have to disprove that by clear and convincing evidence?",
  "Well, Mr. Van Amberg, is the statutory language really as unambiguous as you suggest? It says above the 95th percentile or below the 5th percentile, but it doesn't say above the 95th percentile of local education agencies or below the 5th percentile of local education agencies, does it?",
  "Well, how can the State Supreme Court determine what is the purpose, the intent, of the ballot initiative?",
  "A lot of people voted for it.",
  "But is the State Supreme Court in a position to determine why they voted for it?",
  "How do they know that?",
  "Well, if this money is the non-union member's money and an opt-out -- I'm sorry - - opt-in scheme is not much of a burden on the unions, why should the First Amendment permit anything other than an opt-in scheme.",
  "The union can make it as difficult as it wants for somebody to opt out. They can send a packet that's this thick and not provide a form.",
  "It's not exactly the same situation. These are teachers who have chosen not to join the Washington Education Association; isn't that right?",
  "Isn't it overwhelmingly likely that they, if you spoke to them and you said would you like to give money to the union to spend on elections, they would say no?",
  "Explain to me the thinking of somebody who chooses not to join, the 5 percent who choose not to join, and yet they would like to make this contribution. Now maybe there's some, but what would be the thinking of such a person?",
  "What's the difference between that?",
  "What's the difference between saying would you like to make a contribution, and would you like to allow us to use money that we possess for our purposes rather than returning it to us? What's the difference between those two?",
  "I still don't understand the thinking of these hypothetical people. If I'm a union member, I get various benefits. If I choose not to be a union member, I don't get those benefits. Why would I choose to give up the benefits of union membership and yet want to allow the union to spend my money for its political purposes?",
  "Since the term knowingly or knowing appears in two places in 1681n, can't we infer from that that willfully in that provision also means something different?",
  "I thought the statute says what the permissible purposes are.",
  "When you say more, in order for there to be an adverse action there has to be an increase or an unfavorable change. And when you have an initial application you have to figure out what is the baseline in order to determine whether there has been an increase or an adverse action. And you and the Solicitor General just assert that the baseline in that situation is the best possible rate that you can get, but I don't understand where that comes from.",
  "Well, in Johnson wasn't there also - -",
  "Wasn't there also mitigating evidence about a troubled, about his troubled youth, which is analogous to what was involved at least -- well in both of these cases?",
  "It sounds like you're arguing that the Texas court misapplied Texas law, and you want us to reverse their application of their own law about what is an adequate objection.",
  "Yes, but on the issue of whether there was an adequate -- I thought you were arguing that, in fact, there was an adequate objection. And if the, if the State court held against you on that point, that's an issue of Texas law, isn't it?",
  "Is there any special Federal harmless error standard that applies to unpreserved error?",
  "Well, that's for Federal, that's in the Federal courts. But there isn't one that's applicable able to the State courts, is there?",
  "Well, suppose the court of appeals had done exactly what it did in this case, but it said, we're not giving any special weight whatsoever to the guidelines, we're basing this just on our own evaluation of the sentencing factors that are set out in the Sentencing Reform Act. Would there be a problem there?",
  "That's a principle that you derive from what? From the Sixth Amendment? From the Sentencing Reform Act? From where?",
  "The Sentencing Reform Act required, as enacted by Congress, required trial judges to apply the guidelines, to follow the guidelines. And you're saying that the Sentencing Reform Act now precludes appellate review of -- it gives the trial judges unlimited discretion or extremely broad discretion?",
  "How do you get that out of the statute that was enacted to narrow their discretion?",
  "Mr. Cochran, are you arguing the sentencing in this case violated the Sixth Amendment?",
  "If it didn't violate the Sixth Amendment, then your argument is based on the Sentencing Reform Act?",
  "You can't say whether it did or did not violate the Sixth Amendment?",
  "Well, was your client's sentence enhanced by any fact that should have been submitted to the jury?",
  "What does the Sixth Amendment have to do with the selection of the sentencing philosophy that is to be imposed? How can there be a Sixth Amendment violation if either the guidelines or our case law says military service is or is not a relevant factor? I don't see how that has anything to do with anything that you can get out of the Sixth Amendment.",
  "Isn't this an artificial distinction in -- when you're talking about the making of a tangible part, there's at least some cost involved in doing it here or doing it abroad, and some time involved. But with, with software, the Federal Circuit's point was that it is so easy and inexpensive and fast to copy it that simply sending the information abroad, sending the object code abroad in the form of the golden disk, is tantamount to manufacturing copies overseas.",
  "If these -- if these computers are built abroad and are sold with Windows installed, the component is the electrons on the hard drive? Is that what, that's your position?",
  "Can you think of any machine -- can you think of any machine other than a computer that has a component that is not a physical thing?",
  "If 7426 had not been enacted, wouldn't this case have fallen within 1346 as interpreted by Williams.",
  "What could you point to in the language of 1346 that would take this case outside of 1346 as interpreted in Williams?",
  "But if this case would have fallen within 1346 as interpreted by Williams until - - then you must be arguing that 1346 was in part impliedly repealed when 7426 was enacted.",
  "Why does that make your argument stronger? If Congress didn't think that 1346 applied, then surely it didn't intend to repeal it.",
  "What test, what of deadly force would not be met here?",
  "Considering that it's a summary judgment issue.",
  "Mr. Jones, I looked at the videotape on this. It seemed to me that he created a tremendous risk of drivers on that road. Is that an unreasonable way of looking at the -- at this tape?",
  "When someone is fleeing and creating a grave danger, let's just assume that that's the case, creating a very danger for other drivers on the road, when in your view is it reasonable for the police to use deadly force to stop that, as opposed to breaking off the chase? What, what is the test.",
  "How could you possibly give a warning in this situation?",
  "Before you do that, how much of a practical benefit would it be for children with disabilities and their parents, if you are successful here, in light of the complexity of the IDEA and the fact that this is an area where some parents are going to have difficulty maintaining any kind of emotional detachment from the litigation? If parents can represent their -- can -- a non-lawyer parent can appear in court, isn't there a risk that in some instances where a lawyer could be found if the parent made an effort to do that, they're going to be lured into trying to provide the representation themselves?",
  "General Clement, are you - - are arguing that these lines that you're drawing make a lot of sense in an abstract sense? Or are you just arguing that this is the best that can be done that this is the best that can be done within the body of precedent that the Court has handed down in this area?",
  "Well, Mr. Pincus - -",
  "-- there have been Federal spending programs declared unconstitutional under the establishment clause, and can you cite any instance in which such a holding ing has caused a reduction in tax rates?",
  "See, your traceability either covers every case or it covers no case. In real world taxation terms, no case would ever meet the test. But in, in purely conceptual terms, is any Federal money being spent, every case involving any expenditure of money, even the portion of the Marshal's salary that is devoted to convening the Court in the morning, would be sufficient.",
  "What would happen if when this program was set up, nothing said about faith whatsoever? This was just going to be a general program of outreach to community service organizations, but plaintiffs claimed that as the program was being administered it was heavily favoring religious organizations. Would that come out the same way in your judgment?",
  "It depends totally on how they characterize?",
  "Do you think the distinction between taxing, between taxing and spending and the property clause, makes any sense? Do you think James Madison would not be upset if the Commonwealth of Virginia transferred 10,000 acres to the Anglican Church? That would be okay, but the threepence in taxation would not?",
  "Mr. Tribe, could I ask a question about the RICO claims?",
  "Until I read this case, I had never come across the concept that a Government employee can be guilty of extortion by demanding money for the Government and your brief didn't cite very much authority for this anywhere in the history of extortion.",
  "That's not a lot of, that's not a lot of authority, considering the long history of extortion, just two old New York cases.",
  "Suppose you have a librarian in a courthouse and the librarian is charging lawyers 25 cents a page for photocopies, but there's some library rule that says the fee is supposed to be 10 cents a page. Now is that, is that a RICO?",
  "Are you arguing that there should be a sui generis rule for speech that advocates illegal drug use, or this broader argument that the school can suppress any speech that is inconsistent with its educational mission as the school - -",
  "-- defines it?",
  "Well, that's a very -- I find that a very, a very disturbing argument, because schools have and they can defined their educational mission so broadly that they can suppress all sorts of political speech and speech expressing fundamental values of the students, under the banner of, of -- of getting rid of speech that's inconsistent with educational missions.",
  "But that's a viewpoint-neutral regulation. This isn't, the principal didn't say this was a viewpoint-neutral regulation, did she?",
  "There are many situations in which an appellate court has to apply a legal standard to facts in criminal cases and civil cases. In a criminal case, an issue on appeal could be whether there's sufficient evidence to support the verdict. Do you think there's a burden of persuasion on appeal on all of those issues?",
  "What's the difference between that and applying any harmless error standard? It's exactly the same kind of analysis. It's a different legal test, but you're applying, you're applying the law to facts.",
  "Why is it necessary for us to try to reconcile those two statements? The Ninth Circuit may well have been wrong in finding that there was a violation at all, but we have to assume that, for purposes of the question that's presented to us. So why shouldn't we just analyze the harmless error question independently of what they said about whether there was a Chambers violation?",
  "Well, every time evidence is excluded on the grounds that it is cumulative, or is the equivalent of a 403 balancing in Federal Court, there's not a constitutional error under Chambers and related cases, is there?",
  "Well, I think they overstated the significance of Viereck. Isn't Viereck -- does Viereck stand, do you think, for a per se rule that a prosecutor in a closing argument may never mention the word soldier? Isn't that a much more limited -- much more limited holding? This was a prosecution during World War II of individuals for failing to register as agents of Nazi Germany, and the prosecutor said in the guilt phase - - and it wasn't a capital case obviously, in the guilt phase of closing argument, that just as our soldiers who are fighting the Japanese on the Bataan Peninsula are doing their duty for the country, you have a duty to return a guilty verdict against these individuals. Now, isn't that very different from saying that in a capital -- at the capital phase of the trial, you have a duty to consider something that's very unpleasant, and it's unpleasant in the same way that what soldiers have to do in war time is different? Isn't that very different?",
  "Well, why is that improper? Is it improper at the penalty phase for a prosecutor to refer to the concept of deterrence, which by definition is bigger than the individual whose sentence is being considered?",
  "Do you think moral culpability is the only factor that can be mentioned? I thought you said earlier it was okay for the prosecutor to refer to deterrence.",
  "Can a prosecutor say that killing a witness is something that needs to be deterred and therefore it's important, it's appropriate to impose the death penalty here in order to send a message of deterrence? Is that improper?",
  "So you don't agree with the argument that we've heard this morning that the transformation of American retailing since the 1970s and the rise of the large-scale low-price retailers has anything to do with the end of the fair trade laws and that overruling Dr. Miles would reverse that?",
  "Is there anything to suggest that the large-scale low-price retailers who were supposedly dependent on Dr. Miles are -- support its retention? Have they filed amicus briefs here or otherwise suggested that this is essential to their continuing operation?",
  "Isn't that just a word game? It's jurisdictional because it transfers jurisdiction from one court to the other. Why should that be -- why does that make it jurisdictional?",
  "Can you think of anything that's enacted by Congress as jurisdictional?",
  "Doesn't the latter suggest that a rule that concerns the transfer of a case from one court to another is not necessarily jurisdictional?",
  "Well, it seems to me that's what we're back to, that it's long been treated as jurisdictional. But you just said that it's not sufficient that it's been enacted by Congress and it's not sufficient that it transfers the case from one court to another. So we're back just to history, right?",
  "What would you, what would you have had to have done to find out when it was entered on the docket? Could you have accessed that electronically? Or would you have to go to the court, to - -",
  "In light of the very fine line, how is the Court to distinguish between - - determine whether what's alleged is inextricably intertwined with authorized conduct?",
  "How could the Court -- how could a court enforce that at the 12(b)(6) stage? Determining whether there's strong evidence of one type or another.",
  "Doesn't the -- doesn't the standard at the pleading stage have to be the same as the standard at the summary judgment stage? If - - suppose that a certain set of facts is sufficient to defeat summary judgment. If the plaintiff alleges all of those facts in the complaint, are you saying that that complaint could be dismissed even though supporting those facts at the summary judgment stage would be enough to defeat a summary judgment motion?",
  "Even if there is no Seventh Amendment problem, what sense would it make to have a regime that says plaintiff has to plead more than the plaintiff has to show at summary judgment or prove at trial.",
  "How can you assess the strength of the inference that can be drawn from the facts alleged in the complaint without considering all the inferences that could be drawn from those facts? I just don't understand that argument. You see somebody -- let's say you saw somebody today walking east on Pennsylvania Avenue in the direction of Capitol Hill. Now you -- there's - - you could draw an inference that the person is coming to the Supreme Court. And if there were no other building in Washington, that would be a very strong inference. But don't you also have to consider the inference that the person is going to the Capitol, the person is going to the Library of Congress, the person is going to some other location up here? You have to consider all the inferences that you can draw from the facts.",
  "You're saying this all turns on our assessment of the strength of the interest in remaining in Federal court? Is that what it boils down to?",
  "But could it?",
  "I thought the argument you were making a few minutes ago, if I understood it correctly, was that B.C. Hydro would not have been barred by 1447(d) from taking an appeal to contest the remand; is that correct or not.",
  "Whether it's a collateral order or not just goes to whether it falls under 1291. It doesn't speak at all to the issue of 1447.",
  "The difference between that immunity and Powerex's status is what? It's simply the fact that there's a stronger interest in allowing immediate appellate review, Federal appellate review of the determination of the remand of a party that claims to be a sovereign as opposed to Powerex's status as an organ?",
  "Well, the reason why they may have done that is because they've seen case after case where absolute power corrupts absolutely. And because district judges know that remand orders are not reviewable, on occasion they will remand cases for reasons that are clearly improper. That may be the reason. Now on your first argument, you say that what the district judge says is dispositive. You mean if the district judge says I lack subject matter jurisdiction because my docket is crowded, that's not - -",
  "That's not - -",
  "But if they're flatly contradictory, doesn't your argument have to be that .109(a) has lesser status? That's what it boils down to, isn't it?",
  "I'm talking about what you think the Department of Labor was doing when it promulgated 109(a). It was thinking in effect the following: We have the power to issue a regulation here that has the force and effect of law, and we're going to go through the procedure that would be necessary to issue such a regulation. But we're not invoking that power here because we want this interpretation which we think is the correct interpretation of the statute not to be followed -- not to get as much deference from the courts as it would if we were invoking our power. Does that make any sense? That an agency would proceed in that way?",
  "Of the states to whom a transfer has been made how many have agreed to comply with this provision of the Endangered Species Act?",
  "In the memorandum of agreement with the states to whom transfers have been made, in some of them, is there not language in which the State has agreed that we'll consult with Fish and Wildlife - -",
  "What's the difference between Arizona's situation and all the other States that can issue permits? Are they under legal obligation to consult?",
  "And where is - -",
  "You say it imposes an obligation on EPA to require the States to consult.",
  "I still don't understand the difference between what you think is going to happen in Arizona and what is happening in all the other States that issue permits.",
  "No, in the issuance of a permit in any of these States, pick any State you like, what is the difference between what you envision would happen in Arizona, if Arizona can issue permits, and what's happening in these other States?",
  "What do you make of the fact that twice just before his final statement he's given exactly the question whether he could -- whether he impose the death penalty in any situation other than when the person might get out and kill again, and he - - his answers are at best equivocal. The first time he says I would have to give that some thought. That's on 72. And then he says I do feel that way if parole is an option. Without parole as an option I believe in the death penalty. Which is totally ambiguous. What do you make of those answers?",
  "What if you get a preliminary injunction and then at the permanent injunction stage the basis for the preliminary injunction is reversed. Let's say the preliminary injunction here was based on the ground that the decision was content-based, a factual decision, and at the permanent injunction stage the court finds that it was not content-based.",
  "But you've got five hours billed -- you bill for five hours to write the brief that you submit at the preliminary injunction stage. You could get those fees later if you won at the permanent injunction stage, could you not?",
  "What if that's not the case, but the plaintiff after getting a preliminary injunction just voluntarily dismisses the case? Do they still get costs for the preliminary injunction?",
  "What if the state set up two athletic leagues and one had an anti-recruiting rule and the other didn't, and they were equally strong, and you chose to join the one that had the anti-recruiting league. Would it be a violation of the First Amendment in your opinion?",
  "Yes, both are governmental.",
  "And even if was purely voluntary and even if you had two choices but you chose the -- you chose to join the association with the anti-recruiting rule, there would be a First Amendment problem?",
  "How far does your argument go? If the defendant thinks the State or the jury had some ulterior motive for his sentence, is that sufficient to -- to -- mean -- does that mean the person doesn't have a rational understanding of the reason for the death sentence?",
  "How would you phrase the test to determine how severe the mental illness has to be?",
  "Is that the poverty line?",
  "Is the net worth of $2 million the poverty line now?",
  "So what is -- so what's the rationale? This isn't treating the rich and the poor differently, is it?",
  "Someone with a net worth of $1.5 million couldn't invest the money in the interim?",
  "In the years since CERCLA was enacted have there been any real cases in which a party that you would regard as an innocent party has brought a cost recovery action?",
  "And would that apply if a bus was pulled over?",
  "Everybody on the bus is seized?",
  "In this case, is it correct to view this as -- to view it this way: As soon as the officer approached the car, as I understand it, he recognized the Defendant as a potential parole violator.",
  "And there would be reasonable suspicion then from that moment on, for at least a brief detention of the individual to determine whether in fact there was a warrant for the individual. So all we're talking about, the only period of potential seizure that we have to worry about is up to the moment when the officer sees Mr. Brendlin.",
  "In other words, any seizure after that point would be supported by reasonable suspicion?",
  "What if the officer went, before even approaching the car got on the loudspeaker and said: \"Driver remain in the car; passenger, you're free to go\"?",
  "What's the difference between that situation where the police officer says on the loudspeaker passenger remain, driver you're free to go, and the example that the State has in their brief, in which a car is stopped and as a result of the way it's stopped on a narrow road, the other cars behind that car are for some other period of time prevented from going forward? What's the difference between those two situations?",
  "Well, how do you explain the justification for stopping if there is the seizure, for stopping the innocent passenger because the driver has committed a traffic violation? If that's a seizure of the passenger, then it's a seizure without reasonable suspicion of probable cause, right?",
  "What is this period of time that we are talking about when Mr. Brendlin might or might not have felt that he was free to leave? As I understand the facts, the officer recognized him as one of the two Brendlin brothers immediately upon approaching the car. Isn't that right.",
  "Is what's really involved in this, who is going to get the $5 million reversion that you would get if you purchased an annuity? Is that what's really in dispute?",
  "I mean, PACE would like it, you would like it. I mean, how would a fiduciary decide between those two, if it were a fiduciary duty.",
  "Well, why would the beneficiaries be better off if there were a merger? What would their benefit be, as opposed to an annuity?",
  "Well, why wasn't the ruling of the district court a ruling upon the constitutionality of the statute as applied? As I understand it, you moved to dismiss the case on the ground that an individual performing the duties that Mr. Dayton performed cannot sue a member of Congress for employment discrimination and the district court denied that. Why isn't that a ruling on the constitutionality of the, of the statute as applied?",
  "Was there a dispute about the nature of his duties?",
  "Not how you characterize his duties, but what his duties actually were. Was there a dispute about that?",
  "But didn't the district court rule that somebody performing those duties can constitutionally be tried -- bring suit, and it doesn't, and it doesn't violate the Speech or Debate Clause? So I don't see how that's not a ruling on the constitutionality of the statute as applied.",
  "If this statute - -",
  "If this statute was set up so that the defendant here was the Senate, as opposed to the office of a Senator, would you still say that this suit couldn't go forward?",
  "In what sense would the member be called to answer under those circumstances, if the member isn't a defendant and has no financial liability and is able to invoke the clause as an evidentiary privilege? In what sense would the Speech or Debate Clause be applicable?",
  "Yes.",
  "We were told that 75 percent of the employees who were covered by the Act do not work for an individual member. So how could, how could a provision to be facially unconstitutional under the Speech or Debate Clause?",
  "What could it possibly be? And if it couldn't possibly be then what did Congress have in mind when it provided it for an interlocutory appeal from a ruling on the constitutionality of the statute.",
  "But the test as to any ad is whether any reasonable person could view the ad as -- as an electioneering ad?",
  "Any reasonable person could view it as what?",
  "The same group has long had ads on a particular issue, and let's say a particular candidate's position on the issue is very well known to people who pay attention to public affairs. And let's say we're in the black out period and now important vote is coming up on Congress on that very issue. If the group continues to run the ad on that issue, that -- a reasonable person could view that as, as saying something about the election, couldn't it? Couldn't that person?",
  "That would be prohibited?",
  "What do you -- what do you make -- what do you make of the fact that there are so many advocacy groups that say this is really impractical?",
  "How long will the blackout period be during the upcoming year for the presidential candidates?",
  "If Gilbert F. had attended the public school for 11 days, would this case come out differently, in your view?",
  "If the student here had attended the public school for let's say 11 days before being transferred to the public -- to the private school, would your, would your arguments still fly?",
  "Well, that was my assumption. Let's say he attends public school in a special education class for 11 days. His parents think the public -- the placement that's proposed, the IEP that's proposed by the school is inadequate, and they turn out to be correct, and they want to send their child to the private school, but they understand this argument based on the statutory language, so they say all right, we are going to put him in the public school special education class for 11 days, so -- we've already got the placement in the private school all lined up at the end of the 11 days. He goes one day, we give notice; we take him out and we put him in the private school; then they are entitled to reimbursement subject under your argument.",
  "Well, why would Congress ever have wanted to adopt a scheme like that? What possible purpose is served by simply requiring the student to be in a placement that is by definition not providing a -- not providing FAPE for this very short period of time? It makes no sense whatsoever.",
  "If Congress's purpose really was what you -- what you suggest and what I think Justice Scalia's question suggests, that there was a desire to make parents who really had no interest in the public school system give the public schools a chance, why is it that, even as you read the statute, there's no requirement that the child remain in the public school system for any significant period of time? It's just pro forma.",
  "Is there any suggestion in the reasoning in the Burlington case that it was limited to a situation in which the student had been receiving public school special education?",
  "During the period between Burlington and the enactment of this statute, would you have any doubt about your potential obligation to reimburse a parent -- during the period of Burlington and the enactment of the statute, would the school board have had doubt about its potential liability for reimbursement, in a situation like this?",
  "But you say that the purpose of allowing a candidate to declare a preference is simply to convey useful information to voters, but once you decided, once the State decided, that the ballot was not going to indicate party affiliation, why do you limit candidates to the names of parties? Why don't you allow them to pick some other phrase that better expresses their point of view? Somebody may want to say, I'm the pro-environment candidate, or I'm the no-new-taxes candidate. Why do you limit them to saying Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, et cetera?",
  "What is that and wasn't the purpose that was offered by the proponent of the initiative to try to get around the decision in Jones, to change the system as little as possible?",
  "Will the ballots necessarily be the same in every county?",
  "Some of the counties have paper ballots, some of the counties have -- is that correct?",
  "Well, why can't you do that, if the purpose is to provide accurate information about a candidate's position. Suppose the candidate prefers one party at the time of the primary and then something happens. The issues change. The person -- the candidate says: Well, now my preference is really for the other party. I was close before and I've swung over to the other side. If that's accurate information about where the candidate stands at the time of the general election, why can't that be put on the ballot, unless you're trying to indicate affiliation rather than really preference?",
  "Can I ask you to clarify something you said during your initial argument? I understood you to say that the sample ballot on page 1 of the Grange reply would be unconstitutional.",
  "If Congress made a finding that crack and cocaine are equally dangerous and passed a statute that said, for sentencing purposes, every district judge shall treat cases involving these two substances exactly the same, would there be a Sixth Amendment problem with that? Or do you think every district judge gets the right to make that policy decision individually?",
  "What if the Fourth Circuit sees a number of absolutely identical cases exactly like Mr. Kimbrough's, and it is apparent in one, the sentencing judge either explicitly or implicitly has used a 1 to 1, and the next one used 20 to 1, the next one has used 50 to 1, the next one has used 80 to 1, and the next one has used 100 to 1, what is it to do under reasonableness review?",
  "But the cases are absolutely identical. Everything is absolutely identical about them, except for the sentences. Can't introduce any new variables. What is the court of appeals to do? This is not a hypothetical situation, really. This is what courts of appeals who have to see dozens of these cases have to do. There's a policy question there. How severely should crack be treated? What is the substantive review that the court of appeals is supposed to provide in that situation?",
  "Well, I take it your answer is that all or most of those cases would be affirmed under reasonableness -- under abuse of discretion review?",
  "I thought it was your argument that if any rational judge could impose the sentence that's imposed, then that sentence has to be sustained. So you're saying that either the district court or the Eighth Circuit here was irrational?",
  "No. But in answer to Justice Kennedy's question, you hesitated in saying that, if the district court had taken the approach of the court of appeals, that would also have to be sustained. But under your analysis wouldn't it have to be unless you're going to argue - -",
  "-- that that approach is irrational?",
  "Would the judge have to consider the cases from the judge's district or from the circuit or from the whole country?",
  "Could Congress pass a statute that says age is not relevant in sentencing except in extraordinary circumstances? Would that be a violation of the Sixth Amendment?",
  "If Congress can pass a statute without violating the Sixth Amendment saying age is ordinarily not relevant, then could Congress delegate to an expert agency the authority to make that decision without violating the Sixth Amendment?",
  "Based on what? Why could it -- why can't it delegate the authority if it can do it itself?",
  "Maybe you could take age. What is there about the age of this defendant? He was a 21-year-old college student? Now maybe age is generally a factor that should be considered as a basis for leniency. Maybe it's not. But it's a policy question. What is there about the facts of this case that -- that changes that?",
  "Mr. Roberts, isn't it true that the problems that are being highlighted are problems that result from expansive interpretations of other concepts that are not before us here, expansive interpretation of promotion, expansive interpretation of concealment? The Seventh Circuit in the first appeal in this case interpreted promotion very broadly. And then, I guess it felt that it had boxed itself in and that's what led to this interpretation of proceeds. But if you interpret those other concepts more narrowly, you don't have the same kind of overlap.",
  "Mr. Roberts, isn't it true that the Seventh Circuit's interpretation of proceeds doesn't really solve these problems except in the case of an unprofitable business? In the case of a profitable illegal enterprise, all of the same problems exist.",
  "But this doesn't - - \"proceeds\" must mean the same thing in every money laundering case, doesn't it? And every money laundering case is not based on a gambling business. There are drug businesses and all sorts of other predicates.",
  "Can it mean something different in -- depending on the underlying illegal activity?",
  "Let me go back to the question of the definition of \"proceeds.\" Isn't it very unlikely that Congress would have wanted -- wanted to adopt the net income definition in light of the legal issues and the problems of proof that that would involve? Let's take the example of an international drug ring that has assets in a foreign country. They may have crops. They may have processing plants, warehouses, trucks, airplanes, et cetera. They ship millions of dollars of drugs into the United States. They get millions of dollars in gross revenue here every year. They hire a professional money launderer to launder the money here. Now, the Government wants to prosecute the money -- the person they hired plus members of the organization. The person they hired may not know and may not care whether the money that was being laundered was profits or not. And how are you going to prove what - - whether this enterprise was a profitable enterprise or not? They may have -- and they may have enormous gross revenue, but they may have -- they may have enormous expenses overseas. They may have bought a lot of warehouses and equipment. They may have lost a lot of things because they were raided by the government, destroyed the factory, killed the plants. It becomes as impossible situation, and why would Congress ever have adopted a definition like that?",
  "I'm sure that's true. They wouldn't be that worried about the unprofitable criminal enterprises because they wouldn't last very long. But there's the -- there still is the problem of proof - -",
  "-- proving that it's profitable.",
  "Assuming that the plaintiffs have associational rights at stake here, isn't this a case where there's a conflict between two associational -- two sets of rights of association? You have the party hierarchy who wants to, in your own words, fence out the insurgents. That's a right not to associate. And then you have the insurgents who want to be fenced in?",
  "Isn't that different from the cases that you rely on?",
  "But that's charged language: They have the right to stifle.",
  "The insurgents, do they not -- does not the right of association include the right not to associate?",
  "Is your theory dependent on the proposition that Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola deceived Arthur Andersen?",
  "But didn't you allege exactly the opposite in your complaint?",
  "Well, I'm looking at paragraph 218 of your amended complaint, 109a of the joint appendix, subsection 4. It says, speaking of to boost its revenues by paying vendors higher prices at the same time it received additional advertising from the same vendors, Andersen failed to properly audit these transactions by confirming them with the vendors.\" So you alleged that they weren't deceived. You alleged that they knew exactly what was going on.",
  "All right, just -- just to be clear on this -- if Charter and Arthur Andersen and Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola all sat down and cooked up this scheme together and they all knew exactly what was going on, would you have a claim against the Respondents here?",
  "Then I see absolutely no difference between your test and the elements of aiding and abetting.",
  "Because you just said that it's not necessary for there to be an actual deceptive act on the part of the Respondents.",
  "Well, if we look at this transaction, a guns-for-drugs transaction, is there - - can you think of any good reason why Congress would want to prescribe a 5-year penalty for the person who hands over the gun, but not any penalty for the person who receives the gun and hands over the drugs?",
  "And so that the -- the risk is Congress was worried that somebody would go to a transaction like this with a gun originally intending to trade it for drugs and then when one person gets there, a person decides to shoot somebody with the gun?",
  "And that's why they would penalize one side of this transaction and not the other?",
  "If the person who hands over the gun is not a government agent or informant, is there any doubt that the person who hands over the drugs can be charged with using the -- the gun under 18 U.S.C. Section 2(b)? He causes -- the person who hands over the gun, to do something that is a crime.",
  "Well, you're relying on the language of 924. If you look at the language of 2(b), is there any doubt that this situation would fall squarely under it? \"Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him would be an offense against the United States is punishable as a principal.\"",
  "Isn't the obligation - -",
  "Isn't the obligation that the United States undertook when it signed the UN Charter the obligation to undertake to comply with ICJ judgments in accordance with its own constitutional processes, not necessarily that any ICJ decision would be regarded by any court in this country as binding Federal law?",
  "What if they say - -",
  "-- he goes to jail for no time at all? They say that the remedy for these violations, in order to deter future violations, should be that the charges should be dismissed and any future prosecution should be barred. Would that be automatically binding?",
  "You just - -",
  "You just said that the Avena decision is Federal law. How is the -- how is the Avena decision itself a Federal law?",
  "It's not a statute. It's not the Constitution. It's not a statute. It's not itself a treaty.",
  "If we agree with you, would the effect be that the President can take any treaty that is ratified on the understanding that it's not self-executing and execute the treaty and give it force under domestic law?",
  "Well, why would it not?",
  "Well, when you began by saying we could begin -- we could assume certain things, was it included in the things that we could assume - - was it the proposition that the transaction was limited to a purchase or sale?",
  "Is that different from saying under the exchange rule the FCM is actually the party that enters into the trade.",
  "Where is the clear -- there is no clear definition. There is no definition whatsoever, anywhere, of \"transaction.\"",
  "Could we interpret the term \"law enforcement\" -- \"any other law enforcement officer\" to be limited to those law enforcement officers whose duties generally include the detention of goods?",
  "Well, why doesn't it? It's not clear to me. Maybe this is not within the question, but why were your client's goods detained? \"Detention\" seems to connote holding the goods against the wishes of the owner, and that wasn't the situation here. He gave those goods -- he gave them to the Bureau of Prisons officer for the purpose of having them sent on to his new prison.",
  "Well, you don't think that concept sheds light on what Congress had in mind when it referred to any other Federal law enforcement officer?",
  "How do we know -- how do we know that that's the only purpose of this exception?",
  "This is all based on Judge Holtzoff's testimony? That's the basis for the conclusion that this is the only purpose for this exception?",
  "Are all customs and excise officers law enforcement officers?",
  "Are there other circumstances in which, let's say, goods are being shipped into the country, and the -- the shipment is detained by someone who is not a law-enforcement officer, at least under the definition in subsection (h), someone who has the power to execute searches, seize evidence, and make arrests?",
  "Well, with respect to the in-State anomaly that you were talking about, the government argues on page 30 -- 29 and 30 of its brief that there really are only a few States where this exists, and even in those -- even in the States where it exists, there are very significant restrictions on the ability of the felon to obtain restoration of civil rights. Is that incorrect?",
  "If Congress thought about the problem, what reason could they have for saying that the firearms ban should apply to someone who never lost his or her civil rights, but not -- but would not apply to someone who had civil rights restored? Automatically, let's say. Automatically and within a short period of time. What rationale reason could there be for doing that?",
  "I can understand that argument where there's an individualized determination about each -- each defendant, but I don't quite understand it when it's a blanket restoration of rights.",
  "It's a formal difference matter. There's no substance to it, is there?",
  "Well, General Clement, is there - -",
  "Is there anything to suggest that some of these hypotheticals, where people get child pornography unsolicited in the mail or that kids at school are showing each other not just dirty pictures but actual child pornography, are situations that occur with any frequency in the real world?",
  "What would you say is the best realistic example that you can provide to show that this is overbroad?",
  "Doing -- doing what?",
  "Here we have -- we have one statute that covers advertising, promoting, presenting, distributing, and soliciting. Suppose that all of those activities were not lumped together in one statute, and there was a separate provision for each, and suppose that the Court were to conclude that there is a problem with one of them. Let's say promotes or presents. Would all of the others fall as well, under the overbreadth doctrine, if they were set out in separate statutory provisions?",
  "And if one person says to another, can we get some child pornography, how is that solicitation?",
  "Oh, \"can you get me.\"",
  "And you think that's protected by the First Amendment? Asking someone for child pornography is protected?",
  "But it's not thought at that point. It's a request to obtain contraband, which fuels the production of the contraband. Is it protected by the First Amendment or not, soliciting child pornography?",
  "To fall -- to fall under the statute or to be protected by the First Amendment or not protected by the First Amendment?",
  "Which is it?",
  "I mean the model penal code has a general prohibition of soliciting illegal activities. Are you saying that that's -- that provision violates the First Amendment? Because it's just words?",
  "But I thought the word in the statute is \"solicit.\"",

What is the - - can this be done with any precision or is it more realistic just to say that what the district court would have to do is to figure out whether the State's calculation is within some reasonable range?",
  "I think you said that CSX has properties in 15 States that use the unit method of calculation.",
  "So if you challenge all of those there could be 15 different district court findings on true market value, and so within each circuit the court of appeals would have to decide which district court was correct as a matter of fact?",
  "Would you disagree if had you 10 totally disinterested experts, not paid by either side, and they engaged in this, that they would not all come to the same number, that there would be a range and probably a fairly significant range?",
  "If it had been -- I'm sorry -- if it had been Dickerson's methodology at the last step to choose the highest value, would that be reasonable?",
  "Is what you just said true about conduit bonds, where Kentucky issues bonds to finance private construction? Is the statement that you just made accurate?",
  "That's what you do, isn't it?",
  "Well, as a dissenter in United Haulers, I also don't think it's a good distinction.",
  "But couldn't there be instances where some, an industrial, a company is trying to -- is deciding to locate a plant and is choosing between Kentucky and Ohio, and Kentucky says, come to Kentucky because we'll issue private activity bonds so that you can finance this more cheaply than if you went into Ohio? And when you do that, aren't you, aren't you doing exactly what the dormant Commerce Clause is supposed to prevent?",
  "How would that achieve the same result if these bonds weren't negotiable and they'd be hard to sell, hard for you to sell, if people who bought them couldn't sell them, and they could sell them to somebody out of State and get the higher interest rate?",
  "And these would be bonds that Kentucky citizens could not sell to anyone else?",
  "Anyone who wasn't a Kentucky citizen?",
  "It seems to me you're making a lot of arguments that, if accepted, would -- maybe this isn't true of all of your arguments, but certainly many of them would demonstrate that the Commerce Clause jurisprudence is utterly incoherent. If taxation is the same thing as a subsidy, if congressional inaction is the same thing as approval, if Kentucky bonds are not really in the same market as out-of-State bonds, what would be left of Commerce, of dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence if those arguments were accepted?",
  "Do you want us to -- do you want us to hold that if Congress is, quote, unquote, aware of some sort of discrimination that the States are engaging in, that there is, therefore, no dormant Commerce Clause problem?",
  "What is the difference between that situation and the sort of flow control ordinance that was involved in Carbone? Wasn't Congress aware of those?",
  "No, but why wasn't there the same kind of congressional whatever it is, acquiescence, in Carbone that you're claiming there was here?",
  "What kind of language would we have to find in 2501 in order to conclude that it's jurisdictional? Would it be necessary for the statute to say that there is no jurisdiction unless the -- the claim is filed within a certain period of time?",
  "Is that necessary? Is there anything short of that that would be sufficient?",
  "Doesn't Mr. Haynes have a point when he suggested at the end of his argument that questions about accrual involve much more complicated factual questions than are usually involved in deciding whether a court has jurisdiction? So imagine if this case came up today and the government adhered to its prior position -- I don't know whether it's still it's position -- that there had not been a permanent taking until 1998, would the court -- and none of the events that happened before 1998 had been brought to the court's attention -- would the court have to say to the parties: Well, this is fine; we see that there was a fence put up in 1998, but now you have to tell us everything else that's happened on this site going back 10 years to see whether there -- whether the claim might have accrued at some earlier point.",
  "But what if you didn't think it was -- it was a good argument. Would you have an obligation to say, we think there was a permanent fence put up in 1998 and we agree that there was a taking as of that point, but we don't think it happened earlier, but you need to know all of these additional facts? Would you have an obligation to present that to the court?",
  "Well, EEOC Form 5 is labelled \"Charge.\" And would it be your position that if an employee filled out that form and submitted it to the EEOC, but the EEOC made a mistake and did not notify the employer, that that would not be a charge?",
  "If the employee files an intake questionnaire but not a Form 5, would you say that there would be equitable tolling, or would you say that the employee wouldn't be entitled to equitable tolling because the employee didn't file the right form?",
  "I don't see much difference between the substance of these two forms, other than the fact that the Form 5, I think, requires a listing of the number of employees that the employer has. What -- they basically cover the same ground.",
  "What is the point of these statistics? To show that conciliation wouldn't have done any good? Is that what you - -",
  "What if the person fills out an intake form, checks the box that says \"I do not consent to have my employer notified\"?",
  "But if an employee files something like that and says I don't consent to notification of the employer, can that be a charge?",
  "Doesn't the arbitration agreement in this case set out a standard of review and say on findings of fact they have to be supported by substantial evidence?",
  "Well, if you agree on condition and the conditions are satisfied, are you saying that the district court must enforce under Section 9, or are you saying that enforcement would be under some other authority?",
  "Could I ask you whether the (a)(2) argument would be available to you on remand even if we agree with your interpretation of that provision? Didn't Judge Wilkinson say pretty clearly that the argument had been waived? He said, \"even if the argument were not therefore waived.\" Doesn't that mean that it was waived?",
  "Well, maybe -- maybe they've waived the waiver, but Judge Wilkinson is a careful writer, and if you use the subjunctive there -- \"even if the argument were not therefore waived\" -- doesn't that mean it was in fact waived?",
  "If we agree to you on (a)(2), is there any need to get to (a)(3)?",
  "What would that be?",
  "But do you dispute that there was not -- that there was a loss to the plan in the literal sense?",
  "If - -",
  "But if you accept the truth of his allegations, wouldn't the plan have greater assets than it had?",
  "But have they issued a regulation drawing up this list at this point?",
  "Will, you give as an example of something that wouldn't fall within the 2 percent floor the cost of preparing and filing a fiduciary income tax return. What is the difference between that and getting fiduciary investment advice?",
  "Just because it's a different form that's filled out?",
  "Is it more expensive to - - to fill out a 1041 than to fill out the 1040?",
  "But doesn't your proposed regulation concede that there is investment advisory advice that is unique to -- to estates and trusts? Isn't that what subparagraph C says?",
  "It seems to me the difficulty is in characterizing the level of generality at which you describe the cost, not whether it's ordinary or customary or unique. You run into the same problem no matter how you do that, but you have to decide whether you're talking about investment advice or fiduciary investment advice, tax preparation costs or fiduciary tax preparation costs. And what is the formula for making that distinction?",
  "How do we deal with this problem until there is a regulation? It may be that if the Service issues a regulation and says that these fall into one category and these fall into the other, that would be entitled to a deference. But right now we don't have a regulation, right? So what do we do?",
  "What right do you think --",
  "What right do you think New Jersey has now with respect to the subaqueous land? Is it simply to authorize it to be disturbed to the extent necessary to construct a wharf, or does it go any further than that?",
  "I think you're eliminating the right to wharf out. Before 1905, New Jersey was allowing the construction of wharves, isn't that correct?",
  "Isn't it true -- we can look and see what was authorized or not before 1905. But isn't it true that the ability to wharf out is a classic American -- a classic riparian right --",
  "-- under U.S. law?",
  "And in deciding whether to allow someone to wharf out, the State with jurisdiction would decide whether the wharf was consistent with State objectives, safety objectives, interference with navigation and so forth?",
  "And Article VII says that each State on its own side of the river may continue to make conveyances of riparian rights. So why doesn't that mean that each State is continued -- continues to have the ability to authorize the wharfing out and to decide whether particular wharves are consistent with the State's police powers?",
  "If you separate these two, then the riparian right is worthless, is it not?",
  "It's worthless if you separate those two.",
  "If you say, New Jersey can authorize wharfing out, except Delaware can say you can't wharf out, because it's inconsistent with our police power, then -- then the authorization to allow wharfing out is meaningless.",
  "Well, what's the point you just made that Delaware can't permit a coal wharf but it cannot prohibit a liquified natural gas wharf?",
  "No, but --",
  "-- not what Delaware will do or did do. Can it, could it do that?",
  "Could Delaware prohibit a coal wharf?",
  "Why wouldn't Delaware's police power allow it to require the demolition of all existing wharfs?",
  "Who decides whether it's a nuisance? If Delaware says that docking a sailboat is a nuisance, who decides that? Does all of this have to be decided by us in original cases?",
  "But what if every -- what if every State enacted a slightly different law relating to this and a slightly different law relating to every other product that they might want to restrict for health or safety reasons? Would you -- would you agree then with the Respondent that there would be just the kind of patchwork of regulation at the State level that this statute was intended to stop?",
  "If one of the big carriers decides for its own business purposes to offer a service that complied with the Maine law, would that have the effect of \"un-pre-empting\" the Maine law?",
  "Even if the law - -",
  "Even if they all now decided they wanted to go into this business, that would have no effect because they would have done that to comply with the Maine law rather than as -- in response to the marketplace?",
  "But won't the name of the shipper be in their computer program? I mean, the shipper has to pay, right? Well, they know the name of the shipper - -",
  "Well, don't we have to address 403 in any event? Because the Tenth Circuit ruled, as I understand it, ruled that the evidence could not be excluded under 403. It would have been an abuse of discretion - -",
  "-- for the trial judge to have excluded it under 403.",
  "How do you articulate the rule that separates these situations?",
  "Well, that's the relevant factors, but what do you look at the factors to determine -- what's the test for determining whether they are sufficient?",
  "Well suppose you're -- if you're right on 401 and 402, would -- do we not still have to go on and decide whether it would have been a abuse of discretion for the trial judge to exclude this under 403?",
  "If we find that it would not have been abuse of discretion, then how could we affirm the Tenth Circuit?",
  "Well, maybe, just as an example, you could take Mr. Borel and Mr. Hoopes and explain why their testimony should not have been excluded under 403? As I read Trent, the only thing I have as to either one of them is that they were replaced by young women in their position. That's it as far as admissible evidence for either one. Now, if you do that, the 403 balancing there, why doesn't that lead to exclusion?",
  "Can I ask you about one of the factors?",
  "It's hard to discuss them all at the same time. What is the relevance of strikes of black lawyers that you don't argue were based on race? It's hard for me to understand why that's relevant in this calculation. Suppose there's a case where it's perfectly clear that certain strikes were not racially motivated. Let's say the prosecution has the strategy of striking every lawyer who's on the panel. It strikes every white lawyer and it strikes every black lawyer. Then what is the relevance of the fact that the black lawyers were peremptorily challenged?",
  "That's right.",
  "You are making the argument there were five African-American jurors who were the subject of prosecutorial peremptory challenges.",
  "And -- but you don't claim that three of those strikes were based on race? Do you?",
  "There were a large number of strikes in Miller-El. This is a much smaller number. Could you just explain, if you can, what is the relevance of strikes that you do not even claim were racially motivated?",
  "Mr. Bright, you make good arguments about comparisons between white jurors and black jurors.",
  "What do we do with the comparisons that you are making now to white jurors who were never brought to the attention of the Louisiana Supreme Court?",
  "I think you have a good argument in comparing him to some of the white jurors, in particular Mr. Laws.",
  "But my understanding is you never relied on Mr. Laws before the Louisiana Supreme Court. Is that correct?",
  "But the arguments as to each of them are different. The argument as to Mr. Yeager, I think is much weaker. He had one event on a Sunday and he was told you don't have to worry about that, this case is going to be over by Sunday.",
  "So that's quite different from somebody -- it could be quite different from someone like Mr. Brooks or Mr. Laws. Isn't that?",
  "Well, suppose you are trying this case. You are a defense attorney, and you ask a juror, a potential juror: Would you hold it against a defendant who doesn't take the stand? And the initial answer is: I have to think about that. I'm not quite sure. Now -- and then you go on, and you ask a lot of questions, and the juror comes around to saying: I understand that's a person's constitutional right. They get the -- advice from a lawyer. It doesn't necessarily mean the person has something to hide, et cetera, et cetera. Does that additional questioning allay the concern that you would have had at the beginning about the fairness, the potential fairness, of the juror?",
  "The explanation for Mr. Brooks is not terribly convincing on its face. This is -- was an incredibly short trial, was it not? Mr. Brooks is voir dired on Tuesday. And there's a death verdict on Friday.",
  "And the concern -- the major concern about him is that he's going to worry about missing Wednesday, Thursday, Friday student teaching?",
  "But you compare him to some of the white jurors, particularly, I think, Mr. Laws. Mr. Laws seemed to have a more compelling reason to be worried about not being -- about being in court. He was a contractor. He had houses he had to finish. His wife had recently had surgery. He was taking kids back and forth to the school.",
  "We have no idea -- we have no idea what this man looked like. We have no idea about his demeanor, his tone of voice. This could have been -- there could have been very legitimate reasons for doing it. There could be no legitimate reasons for doing it.",
  "But nobody asked what reason for doing it was.",
  "Do you know whether the PMA process in this case considered the design defects that the Petitioner seems to be relying on?",
  "If you look at the file of a PMA proceeding after it is concluded, can you tell exactly which design features and which risks the FDA has considered?",
  "So the answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, it wouldn't matter where these detainees were held so long as they are under U.S. control. If they were held on a U.S. military base pursuant to a standard treaty with another country, if they were in Afghanistan or in Iraq, the result would be the same?",
  "What if, in a future war, many of the soldiers and the opposing Army don't wear uniforms? What if it's a war like Vietnam and thousands of prisoners are taken into custody and they are brought to prisoner-of-war camps in the United States as occurred during World War II? Every one of them under your theory could file a habeas petition. Is that right?",
  "Your primary position is that we should order that they be released, is that correct?",
  "If the Court holds that the DTA is not an adequate substitute for habeas, what will happen? Will these Petitioners then have access to all of the procedures that normally apply in a habeas proceeding under 2241? The same right to discovery, subpoena witnesses, access to classified information, presence in court?",
  "If an alien has not been diligently pursuing his or her rights, you would argue the person was still entitled to equitable tolling if the alien files a motion to reopen?",
  "Isn't that generally a requirement for equitable tolling: A person has to have been diligently pursuing his rights?",
  "But you don't advocate the adoption of that here. You say if you file a petition -- a motion to reopen, you get automatic equitable tolling.",
  "If the voluntary withdrawal had been withdrawn successfully, he would then have been subject to the alternate order of removal?",
  "And he could have been removed immediately?",
  "And that would have mooted the motion to reopen, wouldn't it?",
  "Would it remain pending once he had left the United States?",
  "What is the basis for the rule that an alien can't withdraw, can't seek to withdraw a request for voluntary departure?",
  "There is no regulation that prohibits it. Is that right?",
  "Isn't it your position that the statute requires tolling?",
  "Well, that seems to be a big part your argument, but it doesn't appear that that argument was raised at all in the Kentucky courts, and it seems that there is virtually nothing in the record of this case that shows that that's practical or that it's preferable to the three-drug protocol. It may well be, but without anything in the record of this case, how could we hold that the three drug protocol is unconstitutional?",
  "Where was it raised? The citations in the brief that was submitted by your co-counsel are inaccurate to show that it was raised in the Kentucky courts.",
  "No, that's -- that's the trial court, and you think that just the word an \"alternative chemical poses less risk\" is sufficient to raise the argument that the three-drug protocol is unconstitutional, because a single drug protocol involving thiopental is preferable. That one word?",
  "Isn't your position that every form of execution that has ever been used in the United States, if it were to be used today, would violate the Eighth Amendment?",
  "Well, which form that's been used at some time in an execution would not violate?",
  "You have no doubt that the three judge protocol that Kentucky is using violates the Eighth Amendment, but you really cannot express a judgment about any of the other methods that has ever been used?",
  "Is there any comparative element in the substantial risk standard, if it were clearly established, undisputed that there was an alternative method that was much less risky, would there be an Eighth Amendment problem with the State or the Federal government nevertheless persisted in using a method that was inferior?",
  "Well, where a defendant is waiving a jury trial or pleading guilty, that's something that an ordinary person can probably readily understand. But how likely is it that an ordinary defendant is going to have any kind of independent opinion on the question of whether it's better for the voir dire to be presided over by a district judge as opposed to a magistrate judge? Isn't the situation going to be in the vast, vast majority of cases that your client will simply turn to you and say, which do you think is better, and whatever the lawyer recommends, that's what the client is going to do? Isn't that the realistic situation?",
  "Do you think there has to be a showing on the record that the waiver is knowing?",
  "So you think there has to be a colloquy like a Rule 11 colloquy or a waiver of counsel's, this is the different, this is what a district judge is, this is what a magistrate judge is, do you understand the difference between the two?",
  "If Mr. Gonzalez had stood up at some point during the voir dire 0and said, Your Honor, I've just learned you're not an Article III judge, and I want an Article III judge to preside over the voir dire, what would happen?",
  "Do you think - -",
  "That would be a good argument if the sole basis for retirement under your system was years of service, but it's not just years of service, isn't that right?",
  "You can't take your -- you couldn't take your statute and erase all the references to age and have the statute work, could you?",
  "Because the ADA expressly allows them to do that; isn't that right?",
  "It seems to me that what Kentucky is trying to do is to, at least in part, provide make-whole benefits for a police officer who becomes disabled below the age of 55. So what they want to do is to say we want to give you the benefit that you would have received if you had not been hurt on the job and therefore unable to work and had been able to work to the normal retirement age. Now, if that's correct, is that an illegitimate objective? And if it's not an illegitimate objective, is there any way that they can do that consistent with your understanding of the ADEA? Because when someone is over the retirement age, it's rather hard to see how many years you would add on projecting how long that person would continue to work beyond the age of retirement eligibility.",
  "So if they want to do that and they have a case of a police officer who works beyond 55 -- the officer is 55-plus with 10 years of service and then becomes disabled -- you say they have to give that person 10 years of credit.",
  "But if do you that, aren't you going to be -- you're going to be undercompensating the younger person who gets disabled and overcompensating the people over 55 who gets disabled who may not -- it may not be realistic to think that someone's going to continue to work as a police officer until 65. I don't know.",
  "Well, is it your position that a State can't require any form of identification and can only require a signature, or would some lesser form of identification than Indiana has required be constitutional?",
  "What was the answer to my question? Is any form of voter identification beyond a signature permissible or not?",
  "If this is not a problem at all, how do you account for the fact that the Commission on Federal Election Reform that was co-chaired by former President Carter and former Secretary of State Baker recommended a voter ID requirement, and many other countries around the world have voter ID requirements?",
  "Well, why would they even require that if it's not any problem at all? Doesn't it at least show that it is a problem of some dimension, maybe not as severe as Indiana claims, but there would be no need for any sort of photo ID problem, requirement, if there were no problem whatsoever. Isn't that true?",
  "Well, if you concede that some kind of voter ID requirement is appropriate, the problem that I have is where you draw the line on a record like this where there's nothing to quantify in any way the extent of the problem or the extent of the burden, how many people will actually be prevented from voting or significantly burdened from voting as a result of the requirement? How do we tell whether this is on one side of the line or the other side of the line?",
  "Why would the rationale not apply in that situation? Are you accepting the proposition that anybody who's arrested for a tax offense is not a danger to the arresting officer? Haven't there been some pretty dangerous people arrested over the years for tax offenses?",
  "Well, why do you draw a distinction between something that's prohibited by a statute, something that's prohibited by a local ordnance or let's say it's a directive of the police department? And if it's -- if the arrest is contrary to any of those things, it's unlawful under State law, is it not?",
  "I thought it was your argument that if the arrest is unlawful under State law it's an unreasonable search, an unreasonable arrest under the Fourth Amendment?",
  "What if Virginia has a statute that said it's unlawful to arrest for a traffic violation, but that it is lawful under Virginia law for an officer to conduct a search incident to any arrest, whether it's lawful under Virginia law or not? Would we follow that latter Virginia law?",
  "What is the difference between that law and in effect what Virginia has in place? They say the arrest is unlawful, but they don't provide for the exclusion of evidence that's obtained as a result of that arrest under Virginia law.",
  "In Johnson, the search was illegal because they illegally entered the hotel room. Isn't that right? So it didn't matter what happened after that point.",
  "Why isn't that an issue in the case, unless you're waiving the issue? Wouldn't it be a question of contract interpretation as to the meaning of the choice of law provision that should be decided by the arbitrator? Unless you want to waive that argument.",
  "Is there any California case that says that this works this way? That after the proceeding is finished before the labor commissioner, the parties have a right to go to arbitration before there's de novo review in the superior court?",
  "Isn't that a question of contract interpretation - -",
  "-- for the arbitrator?",
  "Why not?",
  "How can we decide this case on the assumption that this is simply an arbitration postponing rule when there's no California case that says that, do you acknowledge? And a party resisting arbitration could well argue that the California Code means that you go first to the Labor Commissioner and then, as the statute says explicitly, the parties are entitled to a de novo review before the Superior Court without making any provision for arbitration. Do you think it is inconceivable the California courts could interpret the statute to mean that, that there's no room for arbitration in the -- in this scheme?",
  "Some of those characteristics don't seem to apply to all of the specific crimes that are mentioned. Take somebody who sends a series of letter bombs for the purpose of injuring other people. Now, that would fall within a crime involving use of explosives. But it's not really a property crime and it's not a crime that's more dangerous when done with a gun. So how -- how can you say that those characteristics apply to every crime in the list?",
  "What if the crime is vehicular homicide, defined as causing the death of another person while driving intoxicated? Would that be a crime that creates a serious potential risk of physical injury to another?",
  "The residual clause is a difficult problem, but I still have not heard what characteristic the enumerated offenses have in common, all of them, that provides a basis for limiting the residual clause. They're not all property crimes. A lot of crimes involving explosives: Illegal possession of explosives, illegally manufacturing explosives, obtaining explosives by making false statements. None of those are property crimes and none of them involve injury to a person -- I mean involve the threat of the use of force against a person. So what is the characteristic that all of the enumerated crimes have in common that would provide a limitation on the residual clause?",
  "No, they're not. In 18 U.S.C. 842, explosives, unlawful -- \"It shall be unlawful to engage in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in explosive materials without a license issued under this chapter.\"",
  "There's no intent to cause harm there.",
  "And what is the -- if the legislature made it a crime to send text messages on a cell phone while driving, and the punishment were severe enough to qualify here? Would that be treated the same way?",
  "Why wouldn't drunk driving be property crime? Doesn't it cause an enormous amount of property damage?",
  "Well, if you look at the generality of drunk-driving offenses, those that result in physical injury almost always involve, or in the great majority of cases involve, property damage, too; don't they?",
  "It's not an element of some of these other crimes, either. Is it an element in burglary? Is there a property element in burglary?",
  "That's an entering. An unlawful entering - -",
  "That's a property element?",
  "In light of Apprendi and the later cases, do you think it's feasible any longer to draw a distinction between, between statutes that make recidivism an element of the offense and statutes that originally conceived of recidivism as a sentencing factor but now provide for that to be proven to a jury?",
  "Suppose the State has two statutes: Possession of drugs, maximum penalty five years; possession of drugs by a convicted felon, maximum -- convicted drug felon, maximum penalty ten years. And a defendant is convicted under the latter provision. What would be the maximum penalty for ACCA purposes?",
  "Well, it could be or it would be?",
  "Well, if the maximum penalty there would be ten years, then what if in this case the recidivist element had been submitted to a jury and found by a jury. Would it matter?",
  "Why should the label matter? Maybe as to statutes that were passed before Apprendi and Booker, that at that time it made a difference. But, going forward, what difference does it make whether it's labelled as an element of the offense or a sentencing enhancement that's proven to a jury?",
  "The offense never -- the offense also disregards offender characteristics, or only those offender characteristics that are not elements of the offense?",
  "I'm still not sure what the line is there.",
  "It all depends whether it's labelled an element of the offense by the State legislature?",
  "What has Ohio done - -",
  "What has Ohio done up to this point with respect to this transaction?",
  "If you traded places with Ohio, how would you have treated this transaction under your tax laws?",
  "Say that Mead was domiciled in Illinois but Lexis/Nexis operated in Ohio, would you have just taken -- would you have allocated or would you have claimed that -- the right to tax the entire capital gain?",
  "Well, why would Congress have taken this drafting approach? The private sector provisions were already in existence when it made the statute applicable to Federal workers and there was a specific provision prohibiting retaliation in the private sector. If Congress wanted to carry that over to the Federal sector, why wouldn't they have either copied that or incorporated it? And they did neither, and in fact they enacted a provision that says that the private sector provisions are not incorporated unless they're specifically noted. And this isn't one of the ones that's noted.",
  "Would it be -- would it be unkind to say that the government's position seems to be that a general ban on discrimination includes a ban on retaliation except when the government is being sued? In Jackson the government argued that discrimination on the basis of sex included retaliation. Tomorrow the government is going to argue that the prohibition of discrimination in section 1981 includes retaliation. And yet here you're arguing exactly, what seems to me exactly the opposite position.",
  "Can you say what the government's position is on Title VII, whether there is a retaliation remedy against the Federal Government?",
  "Isn't it quite the contrary, Mr. Garre, that most -- if you did a statistical analysis of all the cases in which there was a retaliation claim, you doubt that you would find that a very high percentage of those are cases in which the person claiming retaliation is also the person who claimed the underlying discrimination?",
  "Do you think it's plausible that Congress intended to treat the issue of retaliation in the Federal sector differently under the various Federal anti-discrimination statutes?",
  "What happens if that approval is given and then a seller enters into contracts and then it's later discovered that, contrary to what FERC thought when it granted the approval, the seller has exercised market power or has otherwise manipulated the market? Is there any remedy in that situation?",
  "Among your arguments, and the arguments of the Respondent, seems to be in some tension -- seems to me in some tension to FERC's market-based rate program. Do you -- do you acknowledge that that is permissible interpretation of the Federal Power Act or not?",
  "Isn't it -- isn't it a central requirement of a market-based rate program that FERC cannot, except perhaps in very limited circumstances, go back and undo contracts that had been entered into under that program, based on a retrospective determination that the rates are not just and reasonable, in the same sense that FERC would have applied that term if the utility had simply filed a tariff?",
  "And even that argument is much narrower than what the Ninth Circuit held, isn't it? The Ninth Circuit just referred to \"dysfunction in the market.\" They didn't say: And dysfunction means manipulation by anybody. They seemed to have included all sorts of other things: The California regulatory program, the weather, and a number of other factors.",
  "Well, didn't the ALJ find there wasn't manipulation in this market, the forward market?",
  "FERC disowned -- did FERC reject the finding of the ALJ as to manipulation of this - -",
  "Do you see any meaningful difference between the language of 1981 and 1982 in this regard?",
  "Do you think that it was narrowed in 1981?",
  "Well, wasn't the purpose of the 1991 act to broaden the scope of 1981 rather than narrow it?",
  "You're saying they would have -- you're saying they would have added an express retaliation provision in 1981 in 1991 if they had thought that the mode of reasoning in Sullivan was no longer sound? Is that what this comes down to?",
  "When you say they legislated against the backdrop, you're -- are you not relying on something they didn't do, rather than anything that they did?",
  "If we thought - -",
  "If we thought Sullivan was incorrectly decided, what should we do? Should we say we accept it insofar as it interpreted section 1982, but we don't necessarily have to extend it to 1981, to take an approach similar to what we did in the recent John R. Sand & Gravel case? Or do we have to apply the reasoning in the 1981 case because of the close relationship between the two provisions?",
  "Suppose someone transports money across a border and is recorded surreptitiously on tape explaining exactly why the person did it, and the person says: The reason why I'm transporting this across the border is because I know that when I get it to the destination country, that's a place where people use huge amounts of cash for bank deposits, for purchases; and, therefore the act of transporting it from the United States to the other country will disguise the nature of the cash as drug money. Would that fall within the statute?",
  "Why wouldn't that fit the literal language of the statute? It's a transportation across the board with the design to conceal the nature, i.e., that it's drug money, of this money?",
  "Was there -- was there evidence about the nature of the Mexican economy?",
  "What was the evidence?",
  "What was the evidence?",
  "Wasn't there an expert who said that Mexico has a cash economy?",
  "And what does that mean?",
  "Does it mean people can spend a lot of cash without raising eyebrows?",
  "In your brief, you argue that there has to be a design to create the appearance of legitimate wealth. Are you drawing back now from that argument?",
  "Well, why would that be so? Suppose -- I mean, just take -- modify my hypothetical. What this person says on the tape is: I'm sending this money across the border because I know that if it - - once it gets there, it will be harder to establish my ownership of it. People will still know that it's drug money perhaps, but they -- it will be harder to establish my ownership of it. Now, would that fall within the statute?",
  "But there wouldn't be an attempt to create the appearance of legitimate wealth there then, would there?",
  "But what if there is a wire transfer to a bank in another country because that bank has bank secrecy laws that will make it impossible to ascertain the location of the money once it is there? Does that fall within the statute?",
  "If that's the purpose. If the person says, I'm sending this to blank country because they've got bank secrecy laws there that make it impossible to find this money once it gets into their banking system.",
  "That's not - -",
  "Does the word \"transportation\" mean the act of transportation across the border or the method of transportation?",
  "Suppose the person who set all this up lives in Mexico and the sole intent of that person was to bring the money back to him in the place where he lives? That would -- would that be money laundering by him, to start out with?",
  "Isn't that a question of - - isn't that a question of his intent?",
  "It's not the effect of the design, is it? It's the intent of the design.",
  "-- the same thing, appearance of legitimate wealth goes to one of the attributes, the nature of what's being transported. It doesn't go to all the other attributes.",
  "Would you explain why you think Mr. Joseffer was wrong when he argued that having a jury decide whether the FDA would have approved the drug or would have withdrawn it from the market if additional or different information had been supplied is incorrect? Doesn't that -- wouldn't that very seriously interfere with what the FDA is doing?",
  "There wouldn't be discovery of internal processes within the FDA? There wouldn't be experts testifying about what the FDA would or would not have done?",
  "Well, what evidence would you introduce to prove the -- to prove the exception if the Second Circuit's decision stands?",
  "What about the statement that Mr. Olson quoted during his argument, when counsel for plaintiffs said to the jury: You haven't seen anything that was submitted to the Navy and you're not going to see anything that was submitted to the Navy?",
  "Well, what was your statement?",
  "The the certificate of performance made its way to the Navy. That was required by contract. Why did you not introduce direct evidence of that in your case?",
  "Would you agree that the Republic is ultimately not going to be able to collect these funds unless it sues in the United States and waives its immunity in that suit? And is that -- is that relevant to the question of whether it should have been forced to proceed in this action?",
  "So they just -- they in fact are obstructing the process - -",
  "-- trying to recognize it?",
  "What does \"attachment\" mean?",
  "Well if Mr. Roth -- if your client had shown up at the magistration with an attorney, could the State of Texas have said, no, your attorney may not be present during the magistration?",
  "Well, does that mean that the right attached prior to the magistration?",
  "At the beginning, at the end?",
  "What does that mean?",
  "Then why could Texas have said your attorney -- why could Texas have not said, although you came here with an attorney, your attorney may not be present because you don't have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel at the magistration? Your right hasn't attached yet. It won't attach until the end.",
  "But when do you say counsel has to be appointed? Is it before the magistration? Is it at the end, immediately upon the end of it?",
  "What if -- what if an attorney had been appointed here ten days after the magistration?",
  "Suppose Texas law provided that there had to be an examining trial within a certain period of time after the magistration unless there was an intervening indictment. Then would you not agree that under those circumstances the defendant would have been entitled to the appointment of counsel shortly after the magistration, at least in order to prepare for the examining trial?",
  "Why would the situation be different simply because Texas law doesn't require the examining trial, but gives the defendant the option of demanding one?",
  "Why is the --",
  "Why is the question of whether the right attaches, which seems to mean different things in different situations, a separate question from what I would think would be the question here: Whether he had the right to have counsel appointed for him. Why isn't that the question, and \"attachment\" is simply a label that is used to express one of the conditions for having the right to appoint a counsel?",
  "Your argument is that its purpose was to prevent the disarming of the organized militia, isn't that correct?",
  "And if that was the purpose, then how could they -- how could the Framers of the Second Amendment have thought that it would achieve that person, because Congress has virtually plenary power over the militia under the militia clauses?",
  "But even if you have -- even if you have a rifle or a shotgun in your home, doesn't the code prevent you from loading it and unlocking it except when it's being used for lawful, recreational purposes within the District of Columbia? So even if you have the gun, under this code provision it doesn't seem as if you could use it for the defense of your home.",
  "If the amendment is intended at least, in part to protect the right to self-defense in the home, how could the District code provision survive under any standard of review where they totally ban the possession of the type of weapon that's most commonly used for self-defense, and even as to long guns and shotguns they require, at least what the code says without adding a supposed gloss that might be produced in a subsequent case, that even as to long guns and shotguns they have to be unloaded and disassembled or locked at all times, even presumably if someone is breaking into the home?",
  "Is there anything to show that the District Council ever considered the issue of self-defense? That -- because they banned handguns and they had this provision on the trigger lock which -- and the issue -- my question with the trigger lock doesn't have to do with whether trigger locks are generally a good idea. It's whether you're ever allowed to take it off for purposes of defense. There's no -- is there anything to show that the -- that the council actually considered what sort of weapon is appropriate for self-defense?",
  "If -- if paralegal charges are not fees but are other expenses, what would be the standard for determining the rate at which they would be compensable? Would it necessarily be cost under this statute or would it simply be what is reasonable?",
  "Well, if -- if it's simply reasonableness -- because I don't see anything in the statute that says that all non-fee expenses are compensable at cost -- if it's simply reasonableness, would it be possible to say that what would be reasonable would be a rate that preserves the ratio between attorneys' fees and paralegal fees that existed at the time when the statute was enacted so that you wouldn't have the problem of attorneys being compensated at the same rate as paralegals?",
  "No. No. If the ratio -- if lawyers were -- I know that if lawyers were compensated at $125 an hour when this was enacted and paralegals were compensated at $75, then it would be a 2-1 ratio, and you'd preserve that.",
  "Well on that point, does the statute say that all non fee expenses are compensable at cost? Or are you arguing that the work that's done by paralegals is a study or analysis project?",
  "Which is it, is it a study analysis or project? That seems like a strange way of describing it.",
  "If you take the example of a nursing home that participates in the Medi-Cal program, what does this require? They have to segregate the funds that they get from the State, and they can't use -- is it the case they can't use any of those funds for union-related speech or just the portion that does not represent profits?",
  "Well, when the State pays a program participant -- let's again take the case of a nursing home -- for providing services to patients who are covered by Medi-Cal, and money is paid to the nursing home, it's your position that remains the State 's money.",
  "I'm sorry. That was an either/or.",
  "Which might be the case?",
  "Could I -- could I ask you what you think Congress might have been trying to do with the 1994 amendment under -- under your reading? Before 1994 the offense had to be classified as a felony. Then they added this definition of \"felony drug offense,\" and as I understand it your reading is that now the offense must be classified as a felony and it must be punishable by more, by imprisonment for more than a year. What would be the reason for adding this new requirement as you see it, that it be punishable by more than a year, if there were not offenses that were classified by States as felonies but were punishable by less than a year? I can't see the point unless the point was to rule those out. And you haven't cited any State statute in your brief that involved an offense that was classified as a felony and is punishable by less than a year. You cited a couple that were punishable by exactly a year, not more than a year but exactly a year. So is it your, your theory that the reason for adding this new language was to make it clear that those offenses where the maximum was 12 months, as opposed to 12 months and a day, would not be counted?",
  "But if I could just come back to that. I looked at those. You cite Ohio, North Carolina, and Arizona and those are all punishable by - - they all have a maximum term of 12 months, not less than. So the difference is between 12 months and 12 months and a day?",
  "But is it plausible that's the reason why Congress added this language? They didn't want -- they wanted to make sure that these felonies that were punishable by just 12 months would not be counted?",
  "What would you do with someone who was convicted -- had a prior conviction of -- for importing 10 tons of heroin in New Jersey, for example, where there are no felonies? What would you do with that, a very serious drug offense in a State that doesn't use the term \"felony\" at all or a foreign conviction?",
  "But what they did -- what they did in the Second Circuit case was to say this is punishable -- this offense is punishable by more than a year in New Jersey and therefore it's a felony.",
  "I know. And that's how they analogized it to a felony.",
  "Do you think there are any circumstances in which a taxpayer can bring a claim under the Tucker Act for the refund of an unconstitutional tax?",
  "Well, any situation in which such a suit can be brought without having filed a claim previously with the IRS?",
  "Just to be clear, so your argument is not limited to the Export Clause. It doesn't matter what provision of the Constitution the tax violates. The same rule would apply?",
  "Well, they argue in their brief that there were instances in which State supreme courts participated prior to the enactment of the Voting Rights Act in changes in election requirements for the purposes of disenfranchising African-Americans. Are they wrong on that? And if they're right on that, what reason is there to think that, without any text in section 5 to making an exception for changes that are made by State courts, what would be the reason for reading that in?",
  "Well, you're saying that if a State passes a statute -- a State legislature passes a statute that's flagrantly in violation of the State constitution, it immediately is precleared, it's locked into place?",
  "If I could just ask you, in making that argument, aren't you asking us to say that the purpose of this act -- that the intent of the Alabama legislature in passing that act is different from the intent as determined by the Alabama Supreme Court?",
  "In answer to a previous question, I understood you to say that if the individuals here were tried by an Iraqi tribunal they would remain in the custody of the Multinational Force during the course of the trial. Is that correct? Does that mean that they would simply be transported to court and then brought back to the custody where they are at the present time during the course of those proceedings?",
  "Well, just to follow up on that, at what point during that, during the trial, would there be any potential for torture by Iraqi authorities.",
  "I still don't -- I don't understand what you're saying about citizenship. You said earlier it wasn't necessary, and it make as big difference. There are thousands of non-U.S. citizens being held Iraq. Your argument with respect to your clients is that they have -- they can file habeas petitions in the District of Columbia and they can't be turned over except pursuant to the extradition treaty between the United States and Iraq; is that correct?",
  "If I could just then finish the question. Pursuant to the extradition treaty or some other authorization; if citizenship isn't important, then why can't all of those thousands of non-citizens -- or can all of those thousands of non-citizens -- who are being held in Iraq file habeas petitions in the District of Columbia and argue that they can't be turned over except pursuant to the extradition treaty or some other authorization?",
  "Could you give an example of where it's not temporal, an example of use of \"during\" that is not temporal?",
  "But hanging up lights \"during\" the -- the holiday season doesn't -- that's not a temporal relationship?",
  "Well, if there's an \"in relationship\" requirement, why would it be necessary for the explosives to facilitate the false statement? Why wouldn't it be sufficient if the false statement facilitated the unlawful use of the explosives?",
  "If the State's objective is to make sure that there is a reasonably fair trial or something that resembles a fair trial, isn't that going to result in the denial of self-representation in a great number of cases?",
  "If it is the case, as a lot of people believe, that it is very -- it's the rare case in which a lay defendant can adequately represent himself or herself, then where do you draw the line?",
  "Do you disagree with the point that's made by the American Psychiatric Association that competency is not a unitary concept, that a person can be competent to assist an attorney at trial but not competent to make all of the decisions and perform in some minimally reasonable way the various tasks that have to be performed during the course of a trial?",
  "You say the test is whether it is instrumental. A transfer has to be instrumental to the plan, is that correct?",
  "That is different from \"necessary\"?",
  "Well, what does it mean?",
  "Is it relevant that this is a tax-exemption provision?",
  "Would you explain why your argument is consistent with Beck versus Prupis? In that case, couldn't the plaintiff show that it was injured by reason of the criminal violation that was alleged, the RICO conspiracy; and, yet, the Court said something more was required, taking an additional requirement from the law of civil conspiracy? How is your argument here consistent with that?",
  "But -- well, the meaning of a RICO conspiracy in the criminal context is very well known. I don't know why it matters whether it is defined in the statute or not; and there is no requirement in that that anybody be injured by virtue of an unlawful, overt act.",
  "Why is it appropriate there to look to the law of civil conspiracy and yet inappropriate here to look to the law of civil fraud?",
  "No, I understand that, but when the pattern of racketeering activity consists of predicate acts of mail fraud, why isn't -- why does not Beck point you to the word \"fraud,\" which like \"conspiracy,\" I don't believe is defined in the RICO statute? So why if you look to civil conspiracy to understand what \"conspiracy\" means in the RICO statute, why do you not look to \"civil fraud\" to find out what the word \"fraud\" means in the RICO statute?",
  "But you can say the same in Beck. It would make civil conspiracy the predicate act in RICO, rather than -- the RICO violation, rather than criminal conspiracy.",
  "But the RICO statute doesn't say you can recover if you're injured by reason of conspiracy, without any elaboration. It says \"by reason of a violation of this statute.\" And therefore you look to 1962(d), which tells you what the violation is. It's a RICO -- it's a criminal RICO conspiracy. So I just don't see how that argument works.",
  "Well, I thought that your argument was that the general principle that was adopted in Montana is the tribal jurisdiction extends only to those things that are necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control internal relations, and that merely entering into consensual commercial transactions doesn't fall within that, but if one were to consent to the jurisdiction of the tribal courts, then that would be an additional basis for jurisdiction. I thought that was what your argument was.",
  "Well, there are many facts here that are favorable to your position, but I would appreciate it if you could articulate the rule of law that you would like us to adopt in this case, the general principle that you would like -- the general rule that you would like us to adopt.",
  "Can that be the case: Any consensual relationship between a member of the tribe and a nonmember is subject to the jurisdiction of the tribal courts?",
  "So an Indian goes to a bank off the reservation and asks for a loan and gets the loan. That contract is subject to the jurisdiction of the tribal courts?",
  "All right. So the Indian goes to the bank and says: I'm an Indian. Give me a loan. The bank gives him a loan. That's subject to the jurisdiction of the tribal courts?",
  "Well, isn't it necessary for there to be some kind of clear notice? Somebody puts an ad in the newspaper to sell a used car. Someone shows up to purchase the used car. He purchases the used car and says: And, by the way, I'm an Indian. That is subject to the jurisdiction of the tribal courts?",
  "Well, why not? What's missing there?",
  "Does \"on the land\" mean - - \"on the reservation\" mean land on the reservation or does it extend any further than that?",
  "Let's say an Indian gets an auto loan for a vehicle to be used in a business on the reservation. Is that on the reservation?",
  "Suppose the district court in this case had said I'm considering an above-Guidelines sentence based on facts that are in the record in the pre-sentence report to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. Would that be adequate notice?",
  "You seem to be requiring a very specific kind of notice, almost as if the district court has to say this is the sentence that I'm considering, and these are the exact reasons that I'm considering; now what do you have to say about that.",
  "Is that what you're asking?",
  "But why would the - -",
  "Well, why shouldn't this rule be dealt with by further rulemaking? It is very clear that when 32(h) was adopted, departure had a specific meaning under the Guidelines. And what we're talking about now was not contemplated at all by the rulemakers at that time. Now, applying 3553(a) in this situation raises different problems, and there are issues regarding the specificity of the notice that's required and the timing of the notice. Why shouldn't this be dealt with by further rulemaking when those -- where those things can be handled in a comprehensive way rather than by the haphazard development of case law by the courts of appeals if we agree with your position.",
  "Are you saying - -",
  "Are you saying that if they had in mind at the time that Booker might be coming down the road.",
  "There would be non-Guidelines variances from the Sentencing Guidelines.",
  "How specific does the notice have to be? I take it it's not enough just to recite one of the 3553(a) factors.",
  "Well, what was required here?",
  "But didn't the decision that the Guidelines are not mandatory make what used to be known as Guidelines departures completely irrelevant? A case that would qualify for a Guidelines departure would, by definition, be a case in which the 3553(a) factors justified a sentence other than a Guidelines sentence? So I don't understand why there's any need to go through the departure analysis any longer at all.",
  "I just don't understand that. You're not -- a court -- a sentencing court, after concluding that there is no ground for a departure under Booker and the later cases, then has to consider the 3553(a) question. So the decision about the departures is irrelevant. It is not dispositive; and, if the court finds that the case qualified for a Guidelines departure, as I said before, by definition, that is going to be a case where the 3553(a) factors warranted a non-Guidelines sentence anyway. So it seems like a useless appendage at this point.",
  "Now, if the cross-appeal rule is jurisdictional, how do you account for the sentencing-package cases? The court makes a mistake on count 1, and the district court makes a mistake on count 1, the court of appeals vacates the entire sentence for the development of a new sentencing package.",
  "So if the Court of Appeals had said that the sentence that was imposed by the district court was unreasonable by two months and accepted the defendant's argument to that extent and then remanded, on remand the district court could have corrected the sentence on the gun counts.",
  "Do you think that all these other States, if told that it is permissible to have the death penalty for child rape at least under some circumstances, would come to the conclusion that the worst case of child rape that can be envisioned is still less heinous than any murder that qualifies for the death penalty?",
  "The plurality opinion in Coker said this: Life is over for the victim of the murderer. For the rape victim, life may not be nearly so happy as it was. Now, you think that's something that would be written today?",
  "Well, didn't the court of appeals actually say there was no collusion, or did it say, we don't need to reach that question?",
  "So these facts do not necessarily show collusion to avoid the preclusive effects of Herrick?",
  "We do not need to determine whether they count as tactical maneuvering. They did find -- they did say there was a close working relationship relative to the successive cases. Didn't they say that?",
  "And could he continue to solicit other members of the association to file FOIA suits all over the country until they finally got a favorable decision?",
  "What happens in this situation? The government gives a reason for whatever the adverse action is. Somebody -- they give -- and let's say a person had lower performance ratings than another person who was retained or given promotion. Your position is the employee can always contest that and say that's not the real reason; that's not factually supported; is that correct?",
  "How is it extremely deferential when the employee is going to say that's not the real reason; the real reason was simply spite and animus and personal dislike?",
  "And that goes before the jury.",
  "The employee says -- look, it seems to me, the employee says in an affidavit the supervisor doesn't like me, and here are the 20 things that the supervisor has done and said over the course of the last five years to indicate personal dislike. Then -- then it goes to the jury.",
  "But there are areas outside of employment where there's a lot of discretion. Suppose someone claims that he has repeatedly gotten speeding tickets for going five miles over the speed limit by a local police department because of some sort of personal feud with the chief of police. That I take it would be a valid claim under Olech because it's outside his employment?",
  "Well, the question was: Don't you run into the same problem of discretion outside of the employment context? For example, a police officer who is alleged to have given someone a ticket or a number of tickets simply because of personal malice as opposed to some sort of uniform policy.",
  "You keep stressing the text of the Equal Protection Clause. Don't you think it's late in the day to be arguing that Equal Protection Clause should be read with that kind of literalness?",
  "It talks about laws, but it extends to situations where what's being -- the unequal treatment is not stemming from the law, but from executive or administrative action.",
  "And in the other example, are there not situations where it's been held to apply that might not fall within the literal language of the clause?",
  "You think in all other respects it's read literally?",
  "Is there any reason to think that this statute will have any greater or different effect of Mr. Davis in the upcoming election than it did in the last election?",
  "Why?",
  "Even if -- even if leveling the playing field is not generally a compelling or maybe even a permissible interest, is it a stronger interest when one of the reasons why the playing field is not level is other action that Congress has taken? If there weren't expenditure limits, then self-financed candidates wouldn't perhaps have as much of an advantage as they do. So if we accept the world in which contribution limits are constitutional, it -- does that provide a basis for Congress to try to rectify at least in part what it itself has done by imposing the contribution limits?",
  "Well, isn't there something very -- isn't there something very strange about having different contribution limits for candidates in an election? Do you think it would be constitutional for Congress to say that the -- the contribution limits for incumbents is X, but for challengers it's 2X or one-half X?",
  "How is it that there is a serious corruption problem in most instances if a contributor gives more than $2,300 to a candidate, but there is no serious -- presumably Congress doesn't think there is a serious corruption problem when this statute kicks in and somebody gives $6,900 to a candidate?",
  "Isn't there a difference, because it may take -- it may take more money to campaign for a particular office, and so the -- it might take a greater amount to have a corrupting influence on -- on that particular race than on a race where the total amount spent is -- is lower. But here you're not talking about different offices.",
  "But it applies different limits to different in the same -- to candidates in the same race. So why would Mr. Davis be subject to potential corruption if he got $2,300 -- $2,301 from a -- from a contributor, but his opponent in exactly the same race would not be exposed to corruption if he got",
  "Can you address Justice Scalia's question about leveling up and leveling down?",
  "Could I ask you whether there is really anything involved in this case? Both the California Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals said it is inconceivable that any rational trier of fact would have concluded that the shooting was excusable or justifiable. Doesn't that virtually guarantee that if there was an error here, it was harmless error?",
  "No. No. Is that correct? Weren't they concluding that, based on the independent evidence, it was virtually inconceivable --",
  "No?",
  "Does the record show what happened after the police went and received the statements by Ms. Avie? Did she ask -- did she ask to have charges brought? Did the police file a complaint?",
  "As far as the record shows, nothing happened? They took this statement and that was it?",
  "Isn't it a strain to say that an employment practice was because of an individual's age, but at the same time was based on reasonable factors other than age?",
  "Doesn't the latter negate the former or come very close to negating the former? And if that's the case doesn't that suggest that it's not really an affirmative defense but what's necessary to show liability?",
  "In this area of the law, \"treatment\" and \"impact\" are words that have tremendously different meaning. Isn't it strange to argue that they used the term \"treatment\" when they really meant \"impact\"?",
  "Do you think that \"based on reasonable factors other than age\" in the ADEA means something different from because of such -- I'm sorry, that the -- because of an individual's age in the ADEA means something different from because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex or national origin?",
  "Well, the practice -- if a practice correlates with a number of -- statistically correlates with a number of different factors, is it because of all of those factors?",
  "But that's not the argument that I understood you to make in your brief. Is that a change from the position you took in your brief?",
  "Could I just get this clear? I thought your position in your brief was that there has to be a demonstration that the conflict had an effect on the decision before there is any departure from the standard abuse of discretion - -",
  "-- the standard of review.",
  "But the problem with that is the Court needs to know what the standard of review is before it gets to the merits. And how is the Court going to know whether conflicting interests played a role in the outcome of a particular benefits determination without looking at the merits of the case unless there is going to be a lot of discovery about internal processes at MetLife and how you treat the people who -- who gets promoted among the benefits administrators and all of that? And that's what I don't understand about that position.",
  "How does a reviewing court know how far it can go from the outer boundary of the zone of reasonableness when there is a conflicting interest? Is it always -- and I don't know how thin you can slice these standards of review. Is it always, let's say 90 percent of the way to the outer boundary; or sometimes it would be 80 percent; sometimes it would be 70 percent?",
  "Does it work like that depending on the facts of the case?",
  "Mr. Frederick, suppose that the FTC had adopted the rule that it considered in 1970 and required that the tar and nicotine figures that were produced by the particular testing method that is at issue here to be placed on all cigarette ads and promotions; and then suppose that Maine issued a regulation requiring that all ads and promotions in the State of Maine state that the Federal figures are misleading and should be disregarded. Would that regulation be pre-empted?",
  "What's the difference between that situation and this situation?",
  "Weren't the claims that were held to be preempted in Cipollone based on general common law duties?",
  "Does the FTC at this point in 2008 have an opinion about whether the tar and nicotine figures that are produced by this testing method are meaningful or misleading?",

  "The FTC's position seems to me incomprehensible. If these figures are meaningless, then you should have prohibited them -- are misleading, you should have prohibited them a long time ago. And you've created this whole problem by, I think, passively approving the placement of these figures on the -- on - - in the advertisements. And if they are misleading, then you have misled everybody who's bought those cigarette for a long time.",

  "Suppose, let's say, that one or more locals someplace else in the country are involved in very, very expensive litigation; and, as a result, the international assesses all of the locals a fee to pay -- to pay for that litigation but at the same time adopts a position that it is extremely unlikely in the future that the international will ever subsidize any other local union litigation expenses. Would the local -- would a -- would a local union not involved in that litigation -- would they - - would it be permissible for them to charge their nonmembers?",

  "If certain -- if certain fees are are being assessed on the theory that this is a pooling arrangement, I don't understand why you're resisting any effort to impose any standards or any inquiry as to whether it's really a pooling arrangement?",
  "Your argument seems to be that the whole analogy of a pooling arrangement is invalid. That was unrealistic, because there really is no way of telling whether any of these things is a pooling arrangement. There is no standard that could possibly be articulated that would be meaningful to determine whether something that is labelled a pooling arrangement really is in any way a pooling arrangement. That seems to me argument. That would seem to cut against the whole idea of pooling arrangements not only for litigation expenses, but for everything else.",
  "In Moses H. Cone, didn't the court say that the controversy was the underlying dispute?",
  "What about the fact that that was not included in the New Jersey statute, nor was it included in -- was it included in the Uniform Arbitration Act?",

  "I know. And you're saying New Jersey; it was, you know, a very complicated argument about the status of it. What about the Uniform Arbitration Act?",
  "But the Petitioner says you never clearly clarify the particular Federal on which the jurisdiction rests on this case. What -- can you clarify that?",

  "How expeditious would it be -- suppose there's negligence on the part of both a court employee and a police department employee. What is the judge supposed to do in deciding the suppression motion? Is this a comparative negligence determination.",
  "How are -- how are you going to determine whether there's error without determining whether there's negligence? Suppose the court clerk calls up the police department and says the warrant is still outstanding, and in fact it's not. And it sends them over a physical copy of a warrant, but that warrant has been withdrawn. Now, the police could always take additional steps: They could send someone over to check the records, to look at the court docket to make sure that the warrant had not been withdrawn. So there would be causality, but it would not determine what they should - -",
  "-- what their duty was. How are you going to determine where this error should be -- should be assigned?",
  "Let me give you another example. Suppose that the court clerk calls up and says -- it leaves a message, gives a message to somebody in the police department. And they memorialize that, and they say \"called up.\" And let's say the warrant number is the same as the docket number of this case. So the court employee says -- writes down \"Called up,\" says, \"Warrant quashed in warrant, in case 07-513.\" The court -- the police department has a record of the call, and they say, \"Received call from court clerk. Warrant to be quashed. Warrant quashed in case 07-531.\" And so the 513 is not quashed; the person is arrested. Now, who caused that? You have to have a hearing?",
  "How do you know that the police department wrote down the wrong number?",

  "Well, what's the justification for drawing a distinction between a court employee and everybody who works for the police department? Suppose the person who makes the mistake in the police department is a -- a person who holds a unionized position where advancement is based purely on seniority, or it's a civil service position where the person is -- is totally protected from any sort of adverse job consequences as a result of displeasure about or pleasure about how the job is being -- being performed. And what's the justification for drawing a distinction between errors committed by those two employees just based on where they fit in the organizational box?",
  "What if it's not a police officer; it is not a law enforcement officer? It is a clerical employee, or it's a computer guy.",
  "Isn't your rule also going to require hearings. If negligence is required - -",

  "And will that be the case in every instance?",
  "How do you know that? What basis do you have for saying that? How do you know that? How many of these hearings have you examined?",
  "But don't you have to show that there are special circumstances here justifying the overruling of Belton?",
  "No?",
  "Now, is this a fair summary of the holding of Belton: When a police officer has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest search the passenger compartment of that automobile?",
  "And if that rule is applied in this case, you would lose; would you not?",
  "What does contemporaneous have to do with officer safety? It has to do with timing doesn't it?",

  "The bright-line rule is set out in one sentence which is the sentence that I read to you but if you just assume for the sake of argument that in order to prevail, in order for you to prevail Belton has to be overruled. What is your, what's the justification for overruling Belton? Is it, has there been no reliance on it, is the Belton rule less workable than the rule that, the case by case rule that you're proposing, is it undermined by subsequent developments and precedent or does stare decisus simply not count in these cases.",
  "That's enough if we think Belton was wrong that's enough for overruling it.",
  "What about the situation where there are multiple occupants but there's probable cause to arrest only one of the occupants?",

  "Let me ask this. Suppose the employer conducts an investigation because it believes that the supervisor has engaged in improper activity. So what they are trying to do is substantiate grounds for dismissal or some other sanction. And then an employee provides information that's exculpatory. Can -- is that protected? Is that -- is that information protected.",
  "Isn't it strange when there are many situations in which testimony or the reporting of information is protected, but when it's done, isn't it usually done both ways, as it is under the participation clause? So that the testimony is - - cannot be the subject of retaliation or the reporting of information cannot be the subject of retaliation, but not it's protected only if it goes in one direction? Isn't that a very odd approach to that situation?",
  "Wouldn't that be very strange? Suppose that this -- the factual situation actually is very severe and is enough to -- to establish liability on the employer's part, but this particular reporting employee doesn't think so. So then the employer might well be very annoyed that this information which can be the -- the basis for liability has been brought out against the employer, and the employer might want to retaliate. Why would that be unprotected just because this employee adds his or her opinion that it isn't serious?",
  "What is the test for determining whether an investigation has been done, and the person has testified? What degree of formality, if anything, is necessary? If -- if somebody in -- in the company simply goes to the office of an employee or the workplace of an employee or encounters the employee in the hallway or someplace and asks a question, is that enough? Does it have to be - -",

  "If the purpose is to -- is to elicit information and protect the people who come forward with the information, then why don't you provide the protection irrespective of what the person says?",

And yet it would turn out that the submission of the erroneous theory did not have a substantial or injurious effect.",
  "Aren't there going to be cases in which there's enough evidence to support the submission of a theory of liability to the jury, but so little that the court is going to be able to say that it's harmless under -- that the submission of the invalid theory was harmless under Brecht?",

  "When I read the opinion of the Washington Court of Appeals, it does not seem to me that what they are doing is providing a literal interpretation of the jury instruction, as I think we have to presume the jury did when they got that instruction. Washington Court of Appeals is interpreting Washington law. And they may be influenced by Washington case law, which is what they cite. They don't -- they quote the instruction but they don't say \"the crime\" means \"a crime\". That's how we interpret the language of the instruction. So there is an overlay of Washington case law, principles of accomplice liability that inform this instruction. So I don't know that you can -- it's reasonable to argue that because they misinterpreted Washington law, they were misinterpreting the literal language of the jury instruction.",
  "Could I ask you this question about the jury's question where they say we are having difficulty agreeing on a legal definition and concept of accomplice; when a person willingly participates in a group activity, is that person an accomplice to any crime committed by anyone in the group? Suppose that the judge had answered that question by saying a person who participates in group activity is guilty of the crime of second degree murder if the person acts with knowledge that his or her conduct will promote or facilitate the commission of the crime of second degree murder. Would you have a case if that answer was given?",

  "Let me ask you -- let me ask you about another practical consequence of your provision. I -- I have seen a lot of these asylum cases, and usually the evidence consists almost entirely of the uncorroborated statement made by the person who is claiming asylum. So in your view the immigration judges are going to have to decide the degree of the threat that the asylum claimant underwent and the consequences of failing to comply with whatever he was directed to do. And they are going to have to do that based solely on the credibility determination made about an uncorroborated witness who's typically testifying through an interpreter and who has all of the mannerisms and aspects of speech of someone who comes from an entirely different culture.

Aren't the situations entirely different?",
  "Can't you say anything about training subordinates in any office. There is nothing unique about training or not training subordinates in a prosecutor's office as opposed to any other government office or, I would suppose, an office in the private sector.

So they like the law the way it existed at sometime in the past, and they are just not going to distribute any of that. Would that be a theory?",
  "Well - -",
  "If you look at the cases that we've had to decide under this statute in the last couple of years, do you think they illustrate that the categorical approach just doesn't work in this situation? Because it puts us in a position for every single crime that comes up here of making -- of trying to ascertain what is the serious risk when we don't have any empirical -- we don't have a number quantifying what a serious risk is, nor can we generally find what the risk is that's associated with a particular class of cases. Maybe when Congress enacted this they never anticipated that it would be done on a categorical basis. Why not just have a determination as to whether there was a serious potential risk in this particular case? So, if you have a -- a nonviolent person who walks away, that's one thing. If you have somebody who has a long list of convictions for violent -- violent crimes and escapes, that's another situation.",
  "Isn't that a separate question? If it had -- if it has to be found by a jury, it can be submitted to the jury?",

  "No. But in -- in the instance where the defendant doesn't think it would be worthwhile to subpoena the -- the recordkeeper, the person who performed the test, but simply wants to put the prosecution through the effort of getting the person there to testify, it's -- what is achieved?",

  "Mr. Bress, before we get into that, could I just ask you a threshold question?

You know, when your firm with all of its expertise and resources comes into the case at the Federal habeas level, will it not always be the case that you will be able to find some additional mitigation evidence and then, under your theory, that will be a new claim and it well get de novo review?",
  "What is the test for determining whether the addition of new evidence is sufficient to make it a new claim?",
  "Can't there be a situation where the Government does create a monument that is a - - a limited public forum? Let's take the example that you just gave, the Vietnam War Memorial. I presume the Government could not refuse to have the names of certain deceased soldiers on that monument because it disagreed with certain ideas that they had espoused at one point or another.",
  "Why is that the answer to the -- the question? Why isn't the answer to the question that monuments generally are not -- the erection of monuments generally are not a forum? There is a fundamental difference between the speaker's corner in the park where anybody can speak and a permanent monument that takes up space, presumably limited public space. And if you have the unusual situation where you are have a monument that is really analogous to a forum, then the forum analysis would be applicable. But to apply it to something like the Washington Monument or the Jefferson Memorial is ridiculous.",
  "Let me give you this example. Just by chance yesterday I was taking a walk in a little neighborhood park , and I saw that there was a monument -- a small monument, donated, and it says right on there donated by a private neighborhood association to commemorate a number of people who were killed in the 9-11 attack on the Pentagon. And now if I searched the town records or the county record and I don't find any resolution saying they adopted this monument as their monument, does that mean that if I would like to put up a monument in the park to commemorate loved ones who died, or people who I respect, I have a First Amendment right to do that?",
  "Well what if the situation is a neighborhood association prepared this; they said we'd like to display it in the park; and the county or the town says fine, go ahead and do it?",
  "Isn't merely allowing the monument to be built on public property sufficient acceptance? If somebody came up to you and said I'd like to put up a monument in your front yard, and you said sure go ahead, do that, aren't you accepting that -- whatever the monument says, in a sense?",

  "What if a collective bargaining agreement requires the arbitration of discrimination claims that are not based on Federal law? Maybe they are based on -- they are based on State law that goes further than Federal law, or maybe they are based on a type of discrimination that's prohibited neither by Federal or State law. Maybe it's discrimination against young people under 40. Could those be -- those would still be discrimination claims with the same potential for -- with a potential for a conflict of interest. Could they be subjected to mandatory arbitration?",

  "If that's so, why shouldn't we exercise that discretion by saying that the expert fees that are available in case of the original jurisdiction of this Court should be the same as the expert fees that would be available in a district court? Maybe they are too low in the district court, but why should there be -- why should we as a discretionary matter, if we have the discretion, provide for radically different fees depending on the court in which the case originates?",
  "I don't want to interrupt you in your enumeration of three reasons, but I just don't see how you get cost into the concept of availability. It doesn't fit in there any better than it does under \"best.\"",

If I look in the real estate page of the -- of the \"Washington Post\" on Sunday and I look for the best house that is available, the best house that is available might cost $50 million. Now, that would be available to me. I couldn't afford it, but it would be available. I don't see how cost can be fit into that concept of availability.",
  "You have a good -- you have a good argument based on the language of the statute, I think, that that costs cannot be taken into account at all.",

Before the regional office? In other words, if there's -- if there is evidence that the veteran as opposed to the VA has to produce, that doesn't change, and whatever the standard is that has to be met to show an entitlement to benefits, that doesn't change either, so that all that's involved here is whether -- whatever showing needs to be made is to be made on appeal or on remand?",
  "If the -- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.",
  "Why is it a speculative enterprise? If you are correct, and the proper resolution in a case like this is a remand, let's say all the way back to the regional office, and if before the regional office it's the veteran who will need to come forward with some evidence supporting the claim, why does it make sense to remand the case to the regional office if there is no possibility that when the case gets back there the veteran can come forward with medical evidence that's needed?",
  "What if you have the situation -- and I think actually your co-Respondent's case illustrates this better than yours. But you have a situation where the record as it has developed contains some evidence that supports the veteran's position and some evidence that supports the position in favor of denial of benefits. The Veterans Administration all the way up through the process finds that the evidence contrary to the veteran's position is much stronger and denies the claim on that basis. The veteran says: I didn't get notice of what exactly I needed to prove. Now, if on remand to the regional office it's still going to be up to the veteran to come forward with medical evidence showing hearing loss or vision - - connecting the vision loss to something that happened in the service, why does it make sense to send it back if there's no possibility that the veteran is going to be able to do that when the case gets back?",
  "Why doesn't this make sense in your case? I think this illustrates what is troubling to me about the Federal Circuit's decision, but maybe I am missing the point. Your client was denied benefits for failure to show a causal connection, to show that his vision loss is service-related. He provided evidence from two private ophthalmologists or optometrists providing very weak causes of -- evidence of causation. One said it was not inconceivable that this was the cause of it. He was examined by two VA doctors, who said it was more likely that this was caused by post-service infection rather than by an explosion while he was in the service. Now if the case -- if the notice was defective, why does it not make sense to say to your client, show us that you can come up with some medical evidence that shows that this is service-related, something more than a doctor who says it's not inconceivable? Then it makes sense to remand it. But if you can't do it on appeal, what sense does it make to remand it, where the same failure to provide evidence is going to doom his claim?",
  "Your position seems to be not that the government should have to show prejudice, but as applied to a case like yours, that there is an irrebuttal presumption of prejudice. What could the government show? They would have to show that there is not a single ophthalmologist in the country who, if he or she examined Mr. Sanders, would find that the vision loss was attributable to a bazooka explosion in World War II?",
  "But if we follow your proposal, then, you could, in a case filed next week or the week after we decide the case, assert exactly the same claim that you asserted here originally, and that would be good law in the Ninth Circuit?",
  "I don't mean in this case. I mean in another case.",
  "I thought what you asked us to do was to reverse on the procedural default issue and remand the case.",
  "That seems to me to be directly contrary to what you say in your brief. The last sentence of your brief: \"This case can accordingly be properly resolved more narrowly by remanding the case to the district court for consideration of the merits of the Brady claim in the first instance.\"",
  "Can I ask you a question about -- on the procedural default issue?",
  "Could you -- could you put yourself in the position of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals? In light of the briefing that they received, if you had been on that court, would you have understood that Petitioner was asserting that he had a valid reason for not raising the Brady claim earlier, because he had not -- at the time when he could have, at the time of the prior proceedings, he had not had access to the State records? Would you have understood that from the briefing that they got?",
  "Was that mentioned in -- in either the principal brief or the -- or the reply brief, the reason why it wasn't raised earlier?",
  "This is a very complicated factual question, isn't it? We're dealing with numerous documents, isn't that right, that you claim are - -",
  "And so you would have to evaluate all of those and evaluate the prejudice against what was in the record, and you're suggesting now that this is something we should decide?",
  "If we read the -- can I ask you this: If we read the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals as having ratified the -- the district court's -- the -- the lower court's treatment of the procedural default issues, having rejected it on the ground that it was previously decided, that would be an instance in which a State court applied a procedural default rule based on an undisputed error of fact. In that situation, would it not -- wouldn't it be clear that there was not an adequate, independent State ground for the decision; and, therefore, no procedural default? And if we were to find that, wouldn't the appropriate step be on this very factual Brady issue to send it back to the lower federal courts?",
  "Doesn't the officer need - - justification for a stop, for a Fourth Amendment seizure, whether because of a traffic violation or because of suspicion of criminal activity; and then in addition to that, reasonably believe that the person is dangerous? I thought that would be -- I thought that was your argument.",
  "In the context of a traffic stop, you don't need, as to the passenger and the driver, you don't need suspicion of criminal activity. The person has been seized as a result of the stop, and then if you add on to that the reasonable suspicion of danger to the officer, that would be sufficient.",
  "Well, you keep emphasizing that this is an urban area, and it seems to me that's going to lead to a test that's impossible to administer. I can think of a lot of circumstances in which the passenger in a car that is stopped will not think for practical reasons that there is much alternative but to wait until the driver is permitted to get back in the car and drive away. All of those would fall under your urban category, wouldn't they? If it's night -- suppose this was a dangerous area. Suppose this was in an area that was the turf of a rival gang, so it really wouldn't be very practical for this person to start walking down the street. There are not just urban areas and rural areas; there are expressways in urban areas; there are suburban areas.",
  "All of those things would - - you would have to draw a line taking all of those things into account.",
  "Well, General Garre said there's no question that there was a policy, and that it was known by and approved by the Petitioners here, but that the policy is different from the policy that you allege.",
  "And that's the question. Where -- what do you think is the most specific allegation in your complaint as to the Petitioners' knowledge and approval of the -- of an illegal policy?",
  "As to paragraphs 96 and 97, which did seem to be the most specific, are those based on any specific information that you have concerning Petitioners, or are they based on inferences that you think you can draw from your allegations about what happened and the nature of the responsibilities of the Petitioners?",
  "I'm not sure that really answered my question. Are they based on anything specific that you know about what the Petitioners did?",
  "Well, they weren't \"all\" completely -- they were not --",
  "Well, that may be what happened here, but if -- if the Second Circuit is affirmed, there may be other suits that are like this. And what is the protection of the high-level official with qualified immunity with respect to discovery if the -- the official cannot get dismissal under qualified immunity at the 12(b)(6) stage? How many district judges are there in the country? Over 600? One of the district judges has a very aggressive idea about what the discovery should be. What's the protection there?",
  "It's a discretionary decision, interlocutory discretionary decision by the trial judge.",
  "I don't see how that's possible a plain reading of the statutory language. You started out by saying you're relying on the plain meaning of the statutory language.",
  "How do you get that out of the statutory language at (e)?",
  "So now you're out of the plain language of the (e) and you're looking at the context of the whole statute.",
  "What's your answer to the plain language of (e)? That was your prime -- that was the argument you started out with, that this fell under the plain language of (e).",
  "How do you explain under the plain language of (e) why -- how you avoid the result that once habeas counsel is appointed in federal court, the counsel has to appear in all of these other proceedings?",
  "New trial in state court, etcetera.",
  "Why would it not be a subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings?",
  "Why is it not a \"subsequent stage of available judicial proceeding\"?",
  "Without using the word \"structure of the statute,\" because there I think you get into lots of trouble -- and you started out by saying the plain language of (e) and I'm still struggling to understand what you're doing with the plain language of (e).",
  "What if the remand is for State post-conviction review, and there is no attorney available under State law for State post-conviction review?",
  "But only things in Federal court?",
  "But I thought it was your position that it didn't apply in that situation.",
  "I thought it was your position that it did not apply in that situation.",
  "So you think it's discretionary.",
  "The court can -- as a matter of discretion, can order the counsel who is appointed to represent the Petitioner in the habeas to go back and handle the exhaustion of a claim in State court\"?",
  "General Garre, I don't want to take up your rebuttal time, but what's the environmental alternative to what was done here?",
  "The standard has to be - - the standard has to be applicable and this is an EPA regulation, isn't it?",
  "And the EPA has said this isn't applicable to this situation.",
  "So your position requires us to determine that EPA's interpretation of those, the statutory regime that you are talking about, 306 and 402, is contrary to the statute?",
  "Well, if it's both -- do you agree that there can be only one permit; there can't be a 402 and a 404 permit?",
  "All right. So, let's change that. What if the -- what if the new source performance standard was not a total prohibition? What if there was an effluent limitation in there, so that a permit could be issued, provided that there was compliance with the effluent limitation? Now, who issues the permit? And I repeat, I understand it's your position that there can't be both a 402 and a 404 permit.",
  "Where do you find that in the statute?",
  "Where there's a situation where possibly there could be a 402 and a 404 permit, the 402 permit trumps the 404 permit?",
  "This wouldn't be an operation in violation of a performance standard. There would be a performance standard.",
  "That can be put into a 402 permit.",
  "And 402 doesn't make any application for -- for the 404 regulations.",
  "Where does it make the - - where does it make provision for application of the standards that should apply to fill under 404?",
  "Where does the statute say that?",
  "Where does it say that? You say that there can't be two permits and you say 402 trumps 404. And I'm asking where in the statute does it say that?",
  "Wasn't there a decision in the lower courts that the alternative was unacceptable as well? And would you represent that if the case were remanded, that would not be your position on remand?",
  "It was never your position that that was unacceptable?",
  "It was never your client's position that creating these permanently destroyed wetlands and creating a mound that was bigger than the Pentagon was an unacceptable solution to the - -",
  "Isn't that the pH at the point where it's discharged, and not the general pH in the lake?",

  "Within how long?",
  "The pH that you just cited was the pH - -",
  "-- just at the point of the discharge?",
  "So, it's 95 percent solid, but there's an effluent limitation, and your position is that there can't be a 404 permit; it has to be a 402 permit?",
  "You say that repeatedly, but what is there to show that he misunderstood, that he misunderstood California law, as opposed to making a practical calculation about how juries would look at this evidence, having found -- having heard the evidence of premeditation and having found premeditation, even though that doesn't decide the NGI issue, as a matter of law. As a practical matter, it makes it quite unlikely that they're going to accept the NGI defense. Where - - and you say that repeatedly.",
  "Where in the record does it show that he misunderstood the law, as opposed to making a practical evaluation of what the jury was likely to do?",
  "Mr. Verrilli, do you think that Michigan v. Jackson is immune from being reexamined at this point?",
  "Well, if we were no longer to adhere to that rule on issues of constitutional criminal procedure?",
  "Well, isn't the prophylactic aspect of Jackson not what Justice Breyer just said, but the rule that a person who has a lawyer is thereafter incapable of waiving the assistance of the lawyer if the person wishes to speak with the police and the police happen to initiate the conversation? You could have a defendant who's the most experienced criminal defense attorney in the world, who knows everything there is to know about trial tactics, who has a lawyer and decides it's in my best interest now to speak to the police. They happen to initiate it. But Jackson has a prophylactic rule that says even in that situation, it can't be done. That's the prophylactic aspect of Jackson, isn't it?",
  "Isn't there -- isn't there that very important principle involved here that doesn't simply involve calculating particular periods of delay? When you have a defendant who starts out by firing a lawyer and engineering the withdrawal of another lawyer by threatening a lawyer, is it appropriate then to go through all of the subsequent periods and attribute the delay to the defendant or to the prosecution or as a neutral factor as if those, the initial events, hadn't occurred? We don't know how quickly this case would have gone to trial if the first lawyer hadn't been fired or if the third lawyer, I guess it was, had not been threatened and forced to withdraw.",
  "Well, what is the trial judge supposed to do? The defense attorney keeps asking for continuances for purposes of investigation. I need more time to investigate. If -- and -- and -- can the court say: You need to tell me exactly what you are doing?",
  "Aren't you giving the attorney a very perverse incentive there? I mean the delay may help the ultimate outcome of the case, and if the -- if the defense attorney can engineer enough delay, he or she may also produce a speedy-trial violation.",
  "And by your client firing the first attorney, correct?",
  "What if you have a situation in which the -- an attorney is appointed, the defendant threatens that attorney, the attorney withdraws. A second attorney is appointed, the client threatens that attorney, the attorney withdraws, and then thereafter a new attorney is pointed, and there is great delay. Maybe more -- two or three attorneys are appointed. There's great delay. Is -- does the -- does the chain of events that started all this get taken into account or do you just start counting the time from the appointment of the last attorney who wasn't threatened?",
  "What if a small -- I don't know how many lawyers are available for appointment in Bennington. What if it's a small jurisdiction where there aren't that many who are available to be appointed? And so you fire the public defender, you threaten the first appointed counsel, and pretty soon you don't have very many left, or the ones that you have left are busy with other cases and delay results.",
  "The -- the error was the failure to give the instruction that appears on page 95 of the joint appendix? Is that the error that you are complaining about?",
  "If hierarchy is not required, then I'm not clear what more -- what you think needs to be shown beyond the fact that there was an association in fact and whatever continuity needs to be shown in order to establish the pattern. What -- what needs to be shown beyond that?",
  "What needs to be charged to the jury that they must find beyond that?",
  "But What does that mean?",
  "I -- I just - -",
  "Suppose you have a gang that gets together every Friday afternoon and by democratic means they decide what crime they are going to commit that weekend. And they are multi-talented so they - - they look at the whole list of RICO predicates, and they choose a different one each -- you know, each weekend to commit. And they do that over some period of time, and in doing that they perform different roles at different times. Is -- is that an enterprise?",
  "We will take that part out of it. They don't look at the statute. They just - - whatever crime comes to somebody's mind. They -- they want to commit a crime every weekend to -- to make some money. But it is a different thing, done by different means, different roles.",
  "Does that have an ascertainable structure?",
  "Well, what structure would there be there? What characteristics of that group would satisfy the structural requirement?",
  "Would you agree there could be a situation in which an individual engages in a pattern of racketeering activity together with other people and yet is not participating in the affairs of an enterprise through the pattern of racketeering activity?",

  "What's lacking there?",
  "What if he has a list of 25 people who may, on various occasions, want to participate with him in bank robberies? So whenever he gets the urge to commit a bank robbery, he gets out his rolodex and he picks one or more of them and calls them up and they commit the bank robbery?",
  "What is the element, then, that is missing?",
  "Well, the judge would have known about what happened anyway from -- from the presentence investigation, wouldn't he?",
  "Why should that be the case? I know plea agreements are not strictly governed by contract law, but there is an analogy and your whole argument seems to be that the government's breach rendered the plea agreement void. But why would that so? There was a plea agreement, voluntarily entered into, and then there was a breach. So, why shouldn't the issue be what is the remedy for the breach? And why shouldn't it be governed by the plain-error rule like most errors that occur at trial?",
  "But you can say that in every case in which parties enter into a contract and later there is a breach. The fact that one of the parties later breaches doesn't mean that there never was a contract. There was an agreement that he voluntarily entered into at that time. And then there was a - - subsequently there was a breach, but that doesn't mean that he involuntarily -- he did not voluntarily enter into the agreement, does it?",
  "What would counsel say about a case in which it's unclear whether there is a breach? There is a factual dispute as to whether there was a breach. Let's say the government agrees that it will reserve the right to call all relevant facts to the attention of the sentencing judge, but won't take a position on sentencing. And the prosecutor in sentencing makes certain remarks that might be interpreted as taking a position or might be interpreted as simply calling facts to the judge's attention. Would it be your position that when a defendant hears that, the defendant can sit back and wait and see whether he or she is satisfied with the sentence and then after this sentence is imposed raise the issue of breach on appeal and not be subject to plain error, rather than calling it to the attention of the sentencing judge at the time when the -- the potential breach could be adjudicated?",
  "I'm not sure that really answers my question.",
  "Are you saying as to some errors there is a plain-error rule, in some breaches there is a plain-error rule, but not as to all breaches?",
  "Are you arguing that the language in subsection (c) codifies the McNabb-Mallory rule?",
  "There is a very big difference, isn't there, between saying we are codifying this rule, we're making it a statutory requirement, and saying, assuming that this supervisory rule that was adopted by the Supreme Court remains in place, we are creating an exception to it? Which of those two things does subsection (c) do?",
  "Well, they have that textual problem, but you have at least an equally big textual problem, because you want to read the first sentence of subsection (a) completely out of the statute based on some supposition about what Congress was intending to do. So really, if you live by the text you die by the text. I don't see how you are going to succeed with a subsection (c) textual analysis if you're going to disregard the text of subsection (a).",
  "And if you read subsection (c) the way you do, it makes subsection (a) mean something quite different from what it says literally.",
  "What you're -- you are not arguing that there is a specific provision that controls a general provision. You are arguing that an arguable negative inference from an arguably more specific provision reads new language into the text of a specific provision. That's what you are arguing, isn't it?",
  "Why would that be the case? The confession could still be suppressed on grounds of involuntariness?",
  "Your argument is you don't trust district judges to make accurate determinations as to whether the confession is voluntary or not. You need -- you need a rule that takes that out of their hands.",
  "What's the purpose of the requirement of prompt presentment?",
  "Mr. Dreeben, Justice Breyer suggested that there are rules of evidence other than those based on the Constitution or McNabb-Mallory that might result in the exclusion of a confession. Maybe there are such rules, but I'm trying to think of them. I can't think of what they might be. Certainly it's not hearsay. Is it ever going to be ruled to be irrelevant? Is it common for a confession to be excluded under Rule 403? Are there rules that would - -",
  "Are you familiar with cases in which a defendant's confession has been excluded under -- under 403?",
  "Can you waive the right, the 5(a) right?",
  "So in a situation like we have here, where the law enforcement officers do not instruct the informant to do anything that would violate the Sixth Amendment and in fact, according to their testimony, instruct him to engage in conduct that is consistent with the Sixth Amendment, there's no deterrent value in later suppressing the use of the statements for impeachment purposes?",
  "But what do you want to deter? You want to deter them from using informants at all, even in a manner that is consistent with the Sixth Amendment?",
  "Which of the things that you've just said result from the use of this for impeachment would not be true with respect to the other situations where illegally obtained evidence has been used for impeachment purposes? Take the Fourth Amendment, for example.",
  "You don't dispute that there was a Sixth Amendment violation at the time this statement was taken, do you?",
  "Under both IMLA and the Rehabilitation Act, leases have to be approved by the Secretary. Doesn't that impose a duty on the Secretary?",
  "Well, under the Rehabilitation Act, if it applied to this lease, what would the Secretary's duty be?",
  "The Secretary has to apply some standard, presumably. What is it?",
  "Is it your -- is it your position that it would be -- that it -- it is not lawful for coal on the Navajo Reservation to be leased under IMLA, that the lease would have to be solely under section 5 of the Rehabilitation - -",
  "But the lease -- the lease doesn't follow the -- the requirements of section 5 of the Rehabilitation Act in -- in respect to its term. But what is your -- is it your position that in entering into a lease the tribe has the authority to decide that we want this to be under IMLA; we want this to be under the Rehabilitation Act? When it comes up to the Secretary for approval, does the Secretary have the authority to say, I'm going to approve this under IMLA; I'm going to approve it under section 5?",
  "I thought that your argument earlier was that all leases of mineral rights on the Navajo-Hopi land are governed by the Rehabilitation Act, and it's not a factual question as to which statute anybody chose at the time of the negotiation of the lease. But recently, in the last few minutes, you seem to be arguing that it was a factual issue that was - - that was unearthed only through later discovery.",
  "Do you think the Constitution prohibits the State from going further than Batson to protect against the use of peremptory challenges for discriminatory purposes? Specifically, is there any reason why a State could not provide that whenever -- that a trial judge always has the authority, when the judge has any suspicion of discrimination, to ask for an explanation from counsel as to the reason, without having to establish -- without there having to be a prima facie case?",
  "If the judge who sat on a State trial was not authorized under State law to hear that particular matter, would that be a due process violation?",
  "What if it's not a single challenge. What if, let's say, each side has six, and the trial judge just arbitrarily refuses to allow a defendant to exercise any preemptory challenge, but the jury -- the jury is ultimately selected, there is no reason to think it's not a fair jury?",
  "Why is that any harder than harmless error analysis that is conducted all the time? For example evidence is erroneously excluded from the trial, and you ask was that a harmless error? But you have to -- there has to be speculation about how this jury would have received the additional evidence. What -- what's the difference?",
  "But the court has no -- has no inside information about the dynamics of that particular jury. It's just -- it's deciding what a rational jury would do, what a -- what a standard jury would do.",
  "No. But how does the Court know anything particular about the jury when it conducts that harmless error analysis? It doesn't.",

One would deliver it with no spillage whatsoever, but the other would deliver it with a certain amount, a small amount of spillage. And Shell chose the latter because it was cheaper.

  "A point on which both you and your adversaries seem to agree is that the Apology Resolution really is not critical to the decision of the Hawaii Supreme Court. Because if you thought that simply taking the Apology Resolution off the books would provide an acceptable outcome from your point of view, you would be happy with our deciding just that narrow question. And your opponent explicitly says that the apology resolution wasn't critical to the decision of the Hawaii Supreme Court; isn't that true?",
  "And isn't it true that you don't think that just saying the Apology Resolution did not change anything would be insufficient?",
  "Well, I don't see where this law -- where those laws get us. The -- the argument that is made on the other side is that the Native Hawaiians have a moral claim to these lands, not that they have a property-right claim to the lands. And if the State of Hawaii, acting through any branch of its government -- and that is not a matter of concern to us -- says they have a moral claim to the land and, therefore, there should not be any land transfers for some period of time, what's inconsistent with Federal law in their doing that?",
  "What is the position that it's -- it is imposing a moratorium on land transfers because it thinks this is the best way to promote the interests of the Native Hawaiians, and part of their thinking is that there was an inequity done when absolute title was transferred to the United States and then to the State of Hawaii? Would that be a violation of federal law?",
  "Doesn't that depend on the context? You can think of examples where you have exactly the same usage and the person wouldn't necessarily know about the ownership of the thing in question?",

Suppose that someone buys an identification card and looks at it, and it looks like it might be a real identification card on which that persons picture has been inserted in place of the real picture, but the person can't be sure and it might really be an entirely fake card. Would that be a violation?",
  "What if the defendant chooses a name -- uses a name other than his or her own name? I guess has a identification card made up with that, and doesn't know for sure that the name that's chosen actually belongs to another person, but because it's not an extremely uncommon name, has -- knows that it's virtually certain that that name belongs to some other person who is unknown to him? Is that a violation?",
  "Well, what if it's not an extremely common name, but not an extremely uncommon name? And what if it's -- what if the defendant chooses Kevin K. Russell? Would that be a violation?",

  "But what was the reason that Respondent's counsel provided for not requesting that test?",
  "Well, let's assume for the sake of argument that there is some constitutional right to obtain DNA evidence for testing postconviction. Would you still -- would you say that that right includes the situation where, A, the prisoner refuses to assert under penalty of perjury that he or she is actually innocent; and applies if there was a tactical decision at trial not to seek DNA testing at all or not to seek the most reliable form of DNA testing that was available at the time?",
  "You think that -- you think that's a novel idea that never occurred to him?",
  "Sorry.",
  "Well - -",
  "How can this constitutional right be limited to DNA evidence? I presume that there are -- that there may be other scientific advances in the testing of physical evidence, and if that happens, why wouldn't the right apply to those as well? Advances in -- advances in detecting fingerprints or testing fibers or all sorts of other things?",
  "I'd like to get back to the second part of the question I asked at the start, which you never really got a chance to answer: Would it be unconstitutional for a State to say that a -- a prisoner can get postconviction access to DNA evidence, but not where it appears that the prisoner is gaming the system? Not where the prisoner declined at trial to ask for DNA testing for a tactical reason because there was a chance that the DNA evidence would be inculpatory? Would that be unconstitutional?",
  "Why is that necessarily so? I don't understand your answer to that question, or your statement that your argument is dependent on the resolution of that choice of law issue. Are the courts of appeals unanimous on the question of whether the enforceability of an arbitration agreement by a nonparty is a question of State law? I think there's at least a Fourth Circuit decision that says it's a question of Federal law, but why -- why do we have to decide that and why is your argument dependent on it? Suppose that is, suppose that were a question of Federal law, what would that -- it might change the ultimate outcome of whether there's an entitlement to a stay, but I don't see why it has any effect on a question of whether there is jurisdiction.",
  "Nor does it mean that you necessarily cannot enforce the arbitration agreement, does it?",
  "If the \"parties\" in -- in section 3 means parties to the arbitration agreement, would that mean that a -- someone who is not a party to the litigation could file a stay motion under section 3, someone who is not a party to the litigation but is a party to the arbitration agreement?",
  "Well, once they intervene, they are a party to the litigation as well.",
  "Once they intervene they are.",
  "Well, they propose a seven-factor test, and all of the other amici, who know a lot about this subject, propose multifactor tests. Public Citizen has ten factors, the ABA has four factors. In an effort to see if this can be put in more concrete terms, I wonder if you would be willing to say categorically that your -- the holding that you're proposing would not apply under any of these situations: Where the judges are appointed, where there are massive contributions and a hotly contested election, but the issue is not an economic issue, it's a social issue; where there isn't any specific issue headed for the court but there are massive contributions by, let's say, the plaintiffs' bar and the defense bar? Could you say categorically in any of those situations that your rule would not apply?",
  "What is the difference between this situation and a situation where a justice or a judge is appointed by an executive and then hears a case that is of critical importance to the executive?",
  "Specifically if Justice Benjamin were term limited, would this case be different?",
  "The buyer -- seller rule would prohibit the prosecution of a buyer on the theory that the buyer aided and abetted, aided and abetted the seller. But I don't see why it applies here. This is not a situation like that. This is a different crime, using a communications facility in facilitating the commission of a felony.",
  "What if the -- the defendant -- what if the defendant who is a buyer of -- of a quantity for personal use does more than simply purchase the drugs? What if information is communicated in the telephone conversation that makes it easier for the transaction to take place or less likely -- less likely that there is -- that the person is going to be apprehended? Would that person fall within the statute?",
  "What would happen in the situation where the person who buys the drug is guilty of -- of a felony? It's an instance of felony possession. Wouldn't the application of your understanding of the buyer-seller rule in that situation lead to the conclusion that even that person could not be convicted under this statute for facilitating the commission of the felony of sale?",
  "Well, that may -- that may be true, but the buyer there still could not under your theory be convicted of facilitating the seller's felony of selling the drugs.",
  "Could I ask you this question? I -- I understand your argument regarding statutory history and the harsh consequences of this. But as far as the buyer/seller rule -- Gebardi and Rewis are concerned, what if the statute said -- made it a crime for -- for a person to use a machine gun in facilitating the commission of a felony? Would you say -- you would have to say that the buyer/seller rule and those authorities would mean that that person could not be prosecuted if they were using the machine gun to facilitate a -- a purchase for personal use; would you not?",
  "Right, but - -",
  "I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
  "Well, I don't -- I don't see the difference between use of a phone to facilitate - - use of a phone in facilitating, use of -- of a firearm in facilitating, unless you can say that the -- the use of a communication facility in effecting the purchase is such a -- a virtually indispensable element of the purchase that it -- it -- it's swept up within it.",
  "So the answer is that this -- it would be the same.",
  "The buyer/seller rule would apply in your view in exactly the same way.",
  "Doesn't that undermine your argument that there's a presumption that a mens rea has to apply, because this is just a sentencing element?",
  "That's the government's - - that's the government's argument. And in order to convict for securities fraud based on an omission, isn't it necessary for there to be a duty to disclose? And what would prevent -- how can we be sure that the jury here did not find that there was no securities fraud because, insofar as the government was proceeding on an omissions theory, your client didn't have a duty to disclose, did not cause a material fact to be omitted.",
  "I agree with that, but why couldn't they find that there was no securities fraud based on an omissions theory because there wasn't any duty on Mr. Yeager's part to disclose?",
  "Can I ask you this about the finality of jury verdicts? Is -- does the Constitution require either Federal or State law to permit the -- a partial verdict?",
  "In every State?",
  "Well, if the Constitution doesn't require that, then why does the Constitution, in your view, require that issue preclusion occur when the jury acquits on certain counts but hangs on other counts? If -- if a partial verdict were not required, and if the jury came back and said, we -- we've reached a verdict on some counts but not all counts, the remedy would be a mistrial on all counts and a retrial on all counts. Why -- why is it does the Constitution require a different result if Federal law or State law chooses to allow the return of a partial verdict?",
  "Do you think the Constitution required Congress to draw the line where it did, limiting this to broadcast and cable and so forth? What's your answer to Mr. Olson's point that there isn't any constitutional difference between the distribution of this movie on video demand and providing access on the Internet, providing DVDs, either through a commercial service or maybe in a public library, providing the same thing in a book? Would the Constitution permit the restriction of all of those as well?",
  "That's pretty incredible. You think that if -- if a book was published, a campaign biography that was the functional equivalent of express advocacy, that could be banned?",
  "Well, most publishers are corporations. And a publisher that is a corporation could be prohibited from selling a book?",
  "I'm not asking what the statute says. The government's position is that the First Amendment allows the banning of a book if it's published by a corporation?",
  "If they had done either of the things you just mentioned, putting it on its Web site or putting it on YouTube, your position would be that the Constitution would permit the prohibition of that during the period prior to the primary or the election?",
  "Would the Constitution -- if -- if BCRA -- if Congress in the next act covered that in light of advances in the Internet, would the Constitution permit that?",
  "Does that mean that your argument boils down to the proposition that the relevant provisions of the UCMJ were intended to eliminate coram nobis, or is there more to your argument than that?",
  "All right. Well, then I'm not quite sure I understand your argument. Maybe you can explain why you contend that if the Respondent had been convicted in a Federal district court and everything else was the same, he would be able to petition for a writ of coram nobis, but he can't in the military courts. What is the basis for that? Both a Federal district court -- a Federal district court is a creature of statute. It has the jurisdiction that Congress gives it and no greater jurisdiction. It has certain what's been termed inherent authority. The All Writs Act applies to it. All of those things are true of the military courts as well. So what is the basis for the distinction?",
  "Well -- well, that, as I understand, was the argument I started out with: That the --Your argument is that the UCMJ was intended to eliminate coram nobis if it had been previously available. That's your -- that's the argument you're making now?",
  "Well, what is the difference on the face -- on their face between the relevant provisions of the UCMJ and the provisions that govern the ability of a criminal defendant in Federal district court to get relief after being convicted? There are limited avenues that are provided under the Rules of Criminal Procedure and under the statutes - -",
  "-- just as there are in the UCMJ. What -- what is the difference?",
  "Was the Second Circuit's decision based on an interpretation of the confirmation order or was it based on subject matter jurisdiction?",
  "But didn't this - -",
  "Isn't that what the Congress gave them in the 1994 Bankruptcy Act?",
  "Do you dispute the proposition that that statute was passed in large part for the purpose of codifying what was done in this case?",
  "The sort of thing that was done in this case?",
  "Is it not the case that most of the claims are claims based on -- based on Manville?",
  "Relating to what Travelers did in relation to Manville, rather than other companies.",
  "You're -- you're making the argument that some of these claims concern things that Travelers did in relation to the defense of other asbestos manufacturers. Now, maybe that means that the -- the bankruptcy court interpreted the order too broadly or -- in that respect. But what does that have to do with the main issue here?",
  "Price Waterhouse was a bench trial.",
  "And Mt. Healthy was a bench trial, wasn't it?",
  "Now, would the -- if there is a direct evidence requirement, it may arguably cause a great deal of problem when the trial judge has to give an instruction to the jury, because then the -- the jury will first have to decide whether a particular type of evidence is present in the case before it can tell what -- who has the burden of proof and what the standard is, but if Price Waterhouse is understood simply as a way for a judge conducting a bench trial to look at the evidence, does it present any of the problems that have been identified with the Price Waterhouse -- that interpretation of Price Waterhouse as applied to jury trials?",
  "Well, if it's just an instruction to a judge conducting a bench trial, it could mean that if the judge sitting as the trier of fact finds that there is direct evidence, strong evidence supporting the plaintiff's claim, then the judge will need to have strong evidence, stronger evidence on the other side in order to rule against the plaintiff. It's not hard to figure out how it might work out in that situation. The problem comes when it has to be posed in the form of a jury instruction.",
  "But Desert Palace was a Title VII case, wasn't it, under the 1991 amendment to Title VII?",
  "Could I ask you this? Do you think that there is a tenable distinction between a mixed motives case and a non-mixed motives case? In every employment discrimination case that gets beyond summary judgment, aren't there mixed motives at play?",
  "Is there any -- is there any empirical evidence to show whether any of this really makes a difference. Have there been studies on the effect of the 1991 amendments, whether they have made a difference in the way cases actually come out?",
  "Well, in addition to that, Mr. Phillips, isn't age more closely correlated with legitimate reasons for employment discrimination than race and other factors that are proscribed by Title VII?",
  "Don't those cases involve two independent physical causes of an event, not the breaking down of human motivation into -- into separate factors?",
  "If the amount of the tax were measured by the number of sailors who were going to come ashore and the number of days they would be ashore, and a small port city wanted to recover the costs that they impose on municipal services, would that be - - would that be subject to the same flaw that you see here?",
  "Well, what do you make of the fact that in -- in 2008 Congress said that that was never its intention, it was never its intention for the President to have the authority to -- to do this?",
  "But as a practical matter, isn't this closely associated with appropriations and with foreign aid? The issue is billions of dollars were going to be needed to reconstruct Iraq in -- in the wake of the war and the money could be provided directly by the United States through foreign assistance, which is part of the thrust of -- of this provision, certainly. And the argument is that this is closely related to it, because it freed up other money that would be used for reconstruction. So why is there anything odd about this being in an appropriations provision?",
  "I don't think that's their argument, counsel. I don't think that it is their argument that No Child Left Behind supplants the earlier act. It is simply their -- their argument is that it informs an interpretation of the language of EEOA, which is that the State is required to take appropriate action, which is a very vague standard.",
  "Can I ask you this question about the Ninth Circuit's decision, which is what we are reviewing? Suppose -- I know there -- there is a debate about how well Nogales is doing at this time. But let's suppose Nogales came in, and they said this: We had plan A back when this was originally litigated, and now we have an entirely different plan, and this plan doesn't cost one penny more than what we were spending in 2000. But it is a very good plan, and it has produced very good results. As I read the Ninth Circuit's decision, they would not grant relief from the judgment under those circumstances, because they focus exclusively on incremental funding for EEL programs and Arizona's funding model. Isn't that correct?",
  "No, but isn't -- that isn't really my question. Isn't -- isn't it the case that the Ninth Circuit judged the -- the permissibility of relief under 60(b) solely with regard to incremental funding and Arizona's funding model?",
  "That's the way it was litigated originally, but I thought the whole focus of the motion for relief from the judgment was: We have a new plan, and it is not tied to funding, and it will produce good results without looking at incremental EEL funding. And wasn't the Ninth Circuit obligated to look at that?",
  "Why does it matter that there is -- why focus on incremental funding for ELL programs exclusively? What difference does it make where the money comes from -- where it comes from, putting aside federal money that can't be supplanted? I just don't understand that.",
  "Well, that may have been their -- that may have been their position originally, but at the time of the 60(b) hearing, what difference does it make whether the money came from funds that were designated for ELL program, or from general State funds, or from county funds? What difference does it make whether the money was taken from some other program that the school was operating? Suppose they fund -- they take the money for the ELL programs from money that was previously used for music instruction, or art, or gym, or teaching German or anything else. Now those may all be bad things, but what does that have to be with the EEOA?",
  "But the fact that you keep talking about the district court emphasizes my concern about the decision of the Ninth Circuit, which is what we are reviewing. And as I read the decision of the Ninth Circuit, they focused exclusively on incremental costs associated with ELL programs and the educational funding model that the State had at that time.",
  "Well, they say. They were required -- the Petitioners were required to demonstrate either that there are no longer incremental costs associated with ELL programs in Arizona or that Arizona's funding model was so altered as to make incremental costs issue relevant. That was their explanation of the holding, 60 -- 63A of the Speaker's appendix.",
  "Mr. Mr. Wright, could I ask you this question. There may be an issue as to what the assistant principal could reasonably infer from the facts that were known by him, whether he could reasonably infer facts that would create a reasonable suspicion that there were drugs hidden in the plaintiff's undergarments. Is that a question for - - for the finder of fact in a case like this, so that it can't be -- there can't be summary judgment for either side unless no reasonable factfinder could find to the contrary?",
  "No, not on the question of qualified immunity. On the issue of whether there is a Fourth Amendment violation.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, the school could keep records on its students, like the police keep records on confidential informants. So if -- unless this student had a proven record of having accurately ratted out a certain number of classmates in the past, she couldn't be believed.",
  "Now, what specifically do you think is missing here? They need -- the school needed to have a direct statement from Marissa Glines that -- that Redding had the -- had the pills in her undergarments; is that correct.",
  "But you have to have direct evidence that the -- the -- it can't be based on inferences?",
  "Is that the distinction you are drawing? The location has to be supported by direct evidence. Somebody has to say that that's where it is.",
  "If Marissa Glines had said specifically that Savana Redding has pills someplace on her person and she's going to distribute them at lunch in the cafeteria, would this be a different case?",
  "What is the difference between that situation and this situation? The differences are slight. Wouldn't that at least be a question that has to be decided by the trier of fact?",
  "I mean, the student says, she has -- she has crack someplace on her person, and she's going to distribute it to kids during the lunch hour, and so they search her -- her garments, and they don't find it. And you're saying that they cannot then go ahead and search her undergarments - -",
  "-- because - -",
  "Well, to play the devil's advocate on that, why couldn't the assistant principal reason as follows: that he has information from -- from Ms. Glines that Ms. Redding has drugs. He has information from another student that drugs are going to be consumed during the lunch hour. Putting those two together, he reaches the -- he suspects that the person who has the drugs has the drugs on his or her person so that they can be distributed at lunch. And then having searched every other part of -- having searched Ms. Redding's outer garments, what's left are her undergarments. So therefore there's a reasonable suspicion that the drugs are -- are located there.",
  "What's wrong with that?",
  "Is that a question of law or is that a question that goes to the trier of fact, whether you could infer reasonable suspicion about the presence of the pills in those locations?",
  "In a 1983 action, wouldn't it be a jury question?",
  "It's not really a party for all purposes in your submission. It's not a party for discovery purposes, is it?",
  "What about the relators and the parties in the four circuits that have adopted the 60-day rule. They had a court of appeals opinion in front of them that said you had 60 days. They're just out of luck now?",
  "Mr. Kneedler, could you explain how summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the Title VII disparate treatment claim can possibly be affirmed, even if the employer had reason to believe that the test that was given would expose itself to liability under a disparate impact theory? If that's not the employer's real reason for refusing to go ahead with the promotions, then isn't there liability under a disparate treatment -- under a disparate treatment theory, and that's a question for the jury? So how can we possibly affirm summary judgment here?",
  "But does the government think that you can just -- in a case like this you can just look at what -- what is said by the ultimate decision-maker and ignore the input from other people who may have influenced the process?",
  "If all the employer - -",
  "If all the employer has is evidence that the test results violate the four-fifths rule, is that sufficient?",
  "Well, if I could modify the question. Is there some statistical point at which that's sufficient, if it's not four-fifths, if it's nine-tenths - -",
  "-- that alone would be sufficient?",
  "And why didn't it have a sufficient basis here? It -- it chose the company that framed the test, and then as soon as it saw the results, it decided it wasn't going to go forward with the promotions. The company offered to validate the test. The City refused to pay for that, even though that was part of its contract with the company. And all it has is this testimony by a competitor, Mr. Hornick, who said -- who hadn't seen the test, and he said, I could do a better test -- you should make the promotions based on this, but I could give you -- I could draw up a better test, and by the way, here's my business card if you want to hire me in the future. How's that a strong basis in the evidence?",
  "What difference does the cut-off score make?",
  "Well, I understand that, but the people at the top would -- the problem here was not the composition of the people who scored above the cut-off, was it? It was the composition of the -- of the people who would be eligible for promotion under the \"rule of three\"?",
  "And that would be so, even if another Mr. Hornick showed up and said, I could - -",
  "I could make a better -- I could make a test? And here are some problems with this second test that you gave?",
  "And if you -- if you do extend that lifeline to the government, aren't you conceding that the amount of the loss is not an element of the offense, and aren't you conceding that it is not necessary for the loss amount to be an element of the offense?",
  "Well, let me give you a concrete example. Let's say it's a Federal mail fraud case. Let's say there are two Federal mail fraud cases, and you don't have to prove the amount of loss in order to convict under the mail fraud statute. In the first case, after the jury returns a guilty verdict they also return -- or together with that they answer a special interrogatory and they say the loss exceeded $10,000. In the second case, the defendant pleads guilty and admits during the plea colloquy that the amount is more than $10,000. Would there be a problem in those cases?",
  "And then - -",
  "What is the -- What is the difference between a defendant's saying during a guilty plea colloquy, the loss was -- I admit the loss was more than $10,000; and the defendant's agreeing for sentencing purposes that the loss was more than $10,000?",
  "Did you have any authority for the -- the idea that a trial judge in a criminal case should ask the jury to answer a special interrogatory regarding a question that has no bearing on the conviction, but may have a bearing on the future immigration status of the defendant, which is what you're suggesting should be done in these tax cases?",
  "Could I ask you this, does this -- which is not exactly on point to the issue here, but does the government have a theory about how the loss is measured for purposes of this statute? Under the sentencing guidelines, the loss was a very complicated calculation, lots of rules about relevant conduct and lots of cases and different ways of proving loss, and here we just have the statute.",
  "What if you have somebody who participates in a -- in a scheme involving $100 million, the total loss is $100 million, but this person had no way of reasonably anticipating that this would be the -- the total amount of the loss, this was a minor participant, and -- where would the -- how would that come out?",
  "Could I ask you about - - about exhaustion? What should we do about exhaustion here? I take it you don't -- you're not waiving exhaustion?",
  "What does that have to do with issue preclusion? The State can't -- that may raise an issue of judicial estoppel. Is that constitutionally required?",
  "Do you think that's realistic? If the parents are convinced going in that this is an inappropriate IEP and they send the child to school for ten days under the IEP, at the end of the ten days they are going to say, oh, well, we've completely changed our mind, now we think this is a good plan?",
  "Well, what happens in the case where - -",
  "And how do you account for the fact that if your district were located in a separately covered political subdivision, you clearly could not bail out.",
  "Well, if section 2 is ineffective, then why didn't Congress extend section 5 to the entire country? Could Congress have reauthorized section 5 without identifying significant differences between the few jurisdictions that are covered and the rest of the country?",
  "Well, it's 18 percent. If these statistics are correct, the difference between Latino registration and white registration in Texas was 18.6 percent, which is not good, but it's substantially lower than the rate in California, which is not covered, 37 percent; Colorado, 28 percent; New Mexico, 24 percent; the nationwide average, 30 percent.",
  "Wouldn't you agree that there is some oddities in this coverage formula? Isn't -- is it not the case that in New York City the Bronx is covered and Brooklyn and Queens are not?",
  "Could I ask you this question about -- about bailout? I mean we have - - there's a very odd aspect to this case. We have an immense constitutional question and then on the other hand you have this little utility district, which -- and you'll correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I got from the briefs, they have never done anything wrong, and they would like to bail out and the Voting Rights Act was intended to permit jurisdictions that were not committing transgressions to bail out. Now if the statute doesn't allow them to do it, the statute doesn't allow them to do it, but is there any good reason why a district like that should not be permitted to bail out?",
  "If it's the case that there is no discrimination going on, no evasion going on in this little utility district, is there any good reason why they shouldn't be able to bail out?",
  "Would you say from your experience and I'm sure you're very knowledgeable about this that there is no great are discrimination in voting in Virginia than in North Carolina or in Tennessee or in Arkansas or in Ohio?",
  "Well, they now have 25 years to look at, or 24 years, to look at the rest of the country. Are they doing that? Are they holding hearings?",
  "Well, Mr. Olson, do you think that media corporations that are owned or principally owned by foreign shareholders have less First Amendment rights than other media corporations in the United States?",
  "Well, with respect to that what is your answer to the argument that more than half the States, including California and Oregon, Virginia, Washington State, Delaware, Maryland, a great many others, permit independent corporate expenditures for just these purposes? Now have they all been overwhelmed by corruption? A lot of money is spent on elections in California; has -- is there a record that the corporations have corrupted the political process there?",
  "Well, what if the particular -- what if the particular movie involved here had not been distributed by Video on Demand? Suppose that people could view it for free on Netflix over the internet? Suppose that free DVDs were passed out. Suppose people could attend the movie for free in a movie theater; suppose the exact text of this was distributed in a printed form. In light of your retraction, I have no idea where the government would draw the line with respect to the medium that could be prohibited.",
  "No, but could they? Which of them could and which could not? I understand you to say books could not.",
  "Mr. Waxman, all of this talk about 100 years and 50 years is perplexing. It sounds like the sort of sound bites that you hear on TV. The -- the fact of the matter is that the only cases that are being -- that may possibly be reconsidered are McConnell and Austin. And they don't go back 50 years, and they don't go back 100 years.",
  "And my point is that there is nothing unusual whatsoever about a case in which a party before the Court says, my constitutional rights were violated, and there is no prior decision of this Court holding that what was done is constitutional. And in that situation is it an answer to that argument that this has never been challenged before? The Court has never held that it was unconstitutional? It has been accepted up until this point by the general public that this is -- that this is constitutional? No, that is not regarded as an answer to that question.",
  "I was on the Third Circuit for eight years under this regime. And it didn't seem to me that the sky was falling. In fact I can't remember any cases, any appeals involving this issue, and we had lots of cases of a variety of kinds. So maybe there's -- I don't want to be a witness in this, but you know, convince me that the sky really will fall if we were to adopt this.",
  "So the Eleventh Circuit was wrong on that issue? Didn't they hold that this was - - this was separate from the merits?",
  "Are you -- are you arguing that the collateral order door is closed now? That - - that nobody else is going to get through that door?",
  "An interlocutory appeal doesn't have to stop everything, does it?",
  "Well, Mr. Kneedler, is true that true, that the case goes on? Isn't it true that of the civil cases that get through discovery, only a tiny percentage ever come to an appealable final judgment? The vast, vast majority of these things are settled, are they not?",
  "Right, because there never could be an appeal.",
  "It means that the erroneous -- if there was an erroneous ruling, it's built into the -- it's irretrievably built into -- well not irretrievably, but powerfully built into the bargaining - -",
  "If the privilege were in a statute, that would make a difference?",
  "Well, couldn't we say that in -- in the situation where there is a change from pretrial status to post-conviction status, the Edwards rule is no longer an irrebuttable presumption, but it's simply a rebuttable presumption? And that there -- that the rule would not apply if the prosecution could show that under the circumstances the reason for the rule, the concern about law enforcement badgering, was not present?",
  "If the change - -",
  "This is an area where it is very difficult to draw lines, at least I find it difficult to draw lines. So let me start you out with an extreme hypothetical, and I would like you tell me whether you think the Edwards rule reaches this far. And if it doesn't, then I would like you to tell me why it doesn't. And what limitations, if any, on the rule you would be willing to defend as consistent with the rationale for the rule. Someone is taken into custody in Maryland in 1999 and questioned for joy riding, released from custody, and then in 2009 is taken into custody and questioned for murder in Montana. Now, at the time of the first questioning, the -- the suspect invokes the Fifth Amendment right to counsel. Now, does the Edwards rule apply to the second interrogation?",
  "And you don't think that's a ridiculous application of the rule? First of all, how are the authorities in Montana possibly going to know whether this person was interrogated previously on a crime for which the person was never convicted in Maryland, and that invoked the right not to be questioned without -- without an attorney? And you think there is badgering in that situation?",
  "So all right, they run the rap sheet and they find out, if they do, that the person was arrested ten years earlier in Maryland and then what? They try to find the detective that questioned the -- the suspect in 1999 in Maryland? And they find out that the detective is retired and is now, you know, fishing down in the Florida Keys, and they have to track this person down and say, now do you recall whether this person -- that's the rule you are arguing for?",
  "Let me pose you my hypothetical again, the same joy riding questioning, and then 40 years later after the person has gotten a law degree and become an entrepreneur and made $20 million, he's taken into custody and questioned by the Federal authorities for stock fraud. Forever, you know, this right that was invoked back in adolescence continues forever.",
  "Why is there a greater risk of badgering when the questioning is about a different offense?",
  "I thought you just said we could -- you were suggesting an -- as an alternative, that -- that Edwards be limited to situations where the questioning is about the same offense.",
  "I mean, this isn't fanciful. We just were asked to take a case involving a statute of limitations issue for a murder that was committed like 30 years ago, and it said suppose somebody is questioned by State authorities for a murder and taken into custody and then released and then, 30 years later, taken into custody by Federal authorities and questioned for a civil rights violation, based on the same underlying transaction. You would say the Edwards rule applies in that situation?",
  "I can think of -- I can think of at least one situation in which the Court has held that there is a time limit in which something has to be done in order to comply with a Constitutional requirement. If we were to choose a time period here, what would -- what would you propose?",
  "What would be - -",
  "What would be a serious - - what would be a serious answer to that question?",
  "All or nothing.",
  "Well, ACCA uses the words \"physical force,\" and any touching involves some physical force. Now, how do we determine how much more than the minimum physical force is necessary in order to fall within the Federal statute?",
  "If there were a State statute that made it a battery to engage in offensive and unwelcome sexual touching, your argument would be that that would not fall within the first prong of ACCA, because there is not a -- it's not likely to cause a physical injury?",
  "Is that right?",
  "If there was a statute that said -- in the old days I'm told people used to throw the contents of chamber pots out the window. If there were a -- a State statute that said it is a crime to dump the contents of a chamber pot on somebody's head, you would say that's -- that doesn't fall within the first prong of ACCA?",
  "Even -- those are classic batteries - -",
  "-- and the language of the first prong of ACCA really tracks the language of the common law crime of battery?",
  "Is it clear that a period of time attributable to a defense request for time to prepare pretrial motions can fall within (h)(7)? Because (h)(7) speaks of a continuance. Isn't that a very -- wouldn't that be a very odd use of the word \"continuance\"? If you make an application to a judge for time, additional time to prepare pretrial motions, do you say, \"I want a continuance of the date on which my pretrial motions are due\"?",
  "Well, there's -- but the courts of appeals have almost universally read (h)(1)(D), or overwhelmingly read (h)(1)(D) to apply in this situation as well. I'm sorry. Not (h)(1)(D), but the introductory phrase.",
  "So the rule that you are arguing for really will accomplish nothing, other than to benefit a small set of defendants who -- who got pretrial preparation time in reliance on court of appeals decisions saying that those could be done without making explicit ends of justice findings on the record?",
  "Well, how is the public going to benefit if all the judge needs -- presumably, district judges are not granting these extensions of time in situations in which they do not think that the ends of justice are served by granting the extension of time. So what is going to be served by requiring them to recite this -- to make this rote recitation on the record?",
  "Where does that show, because the disposition time isn't going to be the same from district to district? Districts vary.",
  "Congress could have required, as they have in some instances, to have a judge decide a matter within a certain period of time. They didn't do that, did they?",
  "Justice Scalia spoke about the aficionada of Spanish bullfighting. Suppose that I am an aficionado of the sort gladiatorial contests that used to take place in ancient Rome, and suppose that some -- Rome or some other place decides that it wants to make money by staging these things and selling videos of them or broadcasting them live around the world. Do you have any doubt that that could be prohibitive?",
  "A gladiatorial contests where the gladiators fight to the death.",
  "Do you have any doubt that that could be prohibited?",
  "No, no, not under this statute, under a different statute.",
  "What about crush videos, which apparently were the focus of Congress's attention when it drafted these? Now, I suppose by an analogy to what Justice Scalia just said about the message of dog fighting videos, the people who produce crush videos think they have a message, and the message is that this is -- this is sexually exciting or it's exciting in some way to see a woman in high heeled shoes crushing a little animal to death. Do you think that is constitutionally protected?",
  "You are not -- you are not even willing to say that that could be prohibited?",
  "Under a properly drawn statute - -",
  "Might. I would really like you to tell me whether it would; whether you are willing to concede. Because we are trying to determine whether this is overly broad. And this is the category of activity that Congress particularly targeted. So to me at least it's important to know whether at least as applied to what Congress principally had in mind, the statute could -- could pass constitutional muster. If it were, you know, as applied.",
  "But in determining whether this is over -- overly broad, do we -- do we think of all of the hypotheticals that we possibly can think of that might fall within this statute: somebody hunting in the District of Columbia, somebody producing fois gras with a goose and say, \"Well, we've thought of a lot of hypothetical situations where this statute might apply and therefore it's overly broad\"? Or do we look at what's going on in the real world?",
  "So we really think of all the hypotheticals. That's how you think we determine the constitutionality of this under the overbreadth doctrine?",
  "If it's the fact that during the ten years when this statute has been in effect there has been no decrease in hunting videos and hunting shows on TV, and all of the rest -- the only perceptible change in the real world is that these -- is that the market for crush videos dried up, at least until the Third Circuit's decision, does that have any relevance?",
  "Well, isn't that -- isn't that due to changes in technology? Before people could show -- could watch videos at home, this sort of thing would -- would be very difficult.",
  "And is there -- in the real world is there a market for sketches of dog fights?",
  "People get a thrill from seeing that?",
  "Well, if that's 100 percent, then what about people who --who like to see human sacrifices? Suppose that is legally taking place someplace in the world. I mean, people here would probably love to see it. Live, pay per view, you know, on the human sacrifice channel.",
  "They have a point of view they want to express. That's okay?",
  "And what if there is no chance of drawing up the activity? Suppose you have the ethnic cleansing channel on cable TV, and there is no - - this is taking place in a country that's beyond our power to influence. Congress couldn't prohibit that?",
  "What are the practical consequences of something being designated as a national memorial?",
  "When this injunction was first entered the statute -- nobody contemplated that this statute was going to be enacted; isn't that correct?",
  "Yes. So isn't the sensible interpretation of the injunction that it was prohibiting the government from permitting the display of the cross on government property, and not on private property that happens to be within the Mojave National Preserve?",
  "Wasn't your argument that this was a violation of the Establishment Clause because it was on government land? Did you make the argument that even if this was on one of the ranches within the Mojave National Preserve, it would still be a violation of the Establishment Clause?",
  "Yes, it was a totally -- so the situation completely changed and the district court either modified the injunction -- it seems to me modified the injunction by interpreting it to mean something quite different from what anybody contemplated it meant when it was originally entered?",
  "When the Solicitor General represents to us that the VFW will be perfectly free to modify this memorial in any way it chooses if they obtain title to this land, do you think that there's any realistic fear that they will be required to maintain this cross, even if they wish to -- to change it in some way?",
  "Well, I thought your argument was that although there was going to be a formal transfer of title, as a practical matter, the government was still involved with the maintenance of the cross on this land. And when the government says that that's not the case, I don't know why that doesn't cure the practical problem.",
  "Well, I -- I thought the government's position was it had to be maintained as a national war -- as a war memorial, but not that it had to be maintained as a cross.",
  "Well, wasn't -- isn't this very different from the situation in Toledo Steel because -- Scale, I'm sorry -- because, if the merits issue that was before the Ninth Circuit was, if not technically moot, nearly moot, by the time they reached it, because of the passage of the new statute. This wasn't -- they said it's not moot because this is simply the voluntary cessation of conduct that's been held to be unlawful, but that is typically applied in the situation where there is a legitimate fear that the -- the party that has been held to be violating the Constitution may simply return to its bad old ways, once the litigation is over. But, here, you have the intervening enactment of a statute by the Constitution -- by the Congress of the United States, and I think it would be quite far-fetched to presume that Congress is simply going to repeal the statute and go back to the way things were, once the litigation is over. So you have a merits issue that's not -- if technically moot, nearly moot. The real merits issue in the case is -- is expressly not decided by the Ninth Circuit. They say, take that back to the district court. And you say that the standing issue goes away because the government didn't appeal the standing issue at a time when the real merits issue in the case had not been decided.",
  "I -- I still don't understand your answer to the Chief Justice's question about how the panels -- how these panels -- how the board, in your view, is supposed to go about making some sort of sensible procedural rules about establishing the that conferencing took place. They can't do it by rulemaking, and you seem to argue that they can't do it by adjudication, so what -- they can't do it at all? There -- this is just going to be chaos, that there is no way to establish a regular procedure to establish that there was conferencing?",
  "Could they -- could they adopt a rule that says that, if the -- if the parties go through -- do everything that is necessary prior to the time of the adjudication, they can't pop up at the very last minute and send in a letter saying: Oh. By the way, there was no conferencing; could they adopt a rule like that because it's just a big waste of everybody's time to leave it to -- to the last minute?",
  "What does the government party define - -",
  "How does the party filing the grievance know exactly which facts are in dispute at the time when they made the submission? Here, there's a dispute about whether there was a dispute about conferencing.",
  "Why would it be limited to a decision to plead guilty? What if a decision to plead guilty would have lesser immigration consequences than a guilty verdict after -- after going to trial? Wouldn't you have the same situation there?",
  "Well, what if -- what if an offer is made for a plea to an offense that would have lesser immigration consequences than the offense for which the person might be convicted if the person goes to trial?",
  "And the -- and the attorney doesn't fully apprise the client of the situation?",
  "Right.",
  "But do you see a difference in principle between the two situations with respect to the issue that is before us here?",
  "Your argument has -- has an appeal because removal is such a harsh consequence, particularly for someone like your client who had been in the United States for a long time. But what troubles me about it is the situation in which the defendant claims -- you know, let's say 5 years after entering a guilty plea or after the passage of some time – that misadvice was given, and the -- the attorney on the other side is a busy public defender who by that time has handled 500 cases and is unable to remember what, if anything, was said about the immigration consequences of the case; there is nothing in the file. I mean, how are those cases going to be handled?",
  "Well, isn't there -- isn’t it different in that the ordinary Strickland claim concerns things that happen at trial and relate to strategy in a criminal case, as to which the public defender or other defense attorney is presumably –- has expertise? But what's -- what’s the answer to this question: The defendant takes the stand and says: My attorney said that, don't worry about it, you are not going to get removed. And the lawyer says: Well, here's my file; I have nothing in this whatsoever about having said anything about removal, and I can't remember the particulars of every single conversation I had with this attorney 5 -- with this client, 5 years ago.",
  "But what are you going to do in the situation where the defendant is concerned about removal -- the removal consequences? And this is -- let's say this is a case out in some rural jurisdiction, you have got a public defender or a retained attorney, and the -- the attorney is -- you know, provides advice based on the criminal law consequences and the client says: Well, I'm also concerned about the immigration consequences. And the lawyer says: Well, immigration law is very complicated, and I'm not an expert on this and I'm not going to tell you. And so the client says -- and the lawyer says: If you want to know about that you've got to get a deportation –- you’ve got to get an immigration lawyer. And the alien defendant says: Well, I have no money; that's why you were appointed to represent me. How am I going to get advice on the immigration law issue? And the lawyer says: Well, that's just too bad for you. And that's the line you want us to draw?",
  "What about the situation where the attorney says nothing about -- I mean, removal is -- is out there as -- as a real possibility, but it just doesn't occur to the -- the defendant, and the attorney doesn't even mention, you know, you might -- you might want to think about the removal consequences of this?",
  "What about the situation where the -- the defendant would have made sacrifices and obtained competent immigration advice, were it not for affirmative misrepresentations by criminal defense -- by criminal defense attorneys? The criminal defense attorney says: Don't worry about it, you are not going to be removed. And the defendant says: You really sure about that? Because, you know, if you’re not, my relatives are going to get a second mortgage on the house and we are going to go hire an immigration lawyer so we can be absolutely sure about that -- this. And the criminal attorney says: I'm an expert on this. I've just had, you know, six hours of CLE -- -- on immigration law. And in reliance on that faulty advice, the defendant pleads guilty and finds himself facing removal.",
  "Well, just to be --",
  "Just to be clear about the scope of your argument -- maybe you could just clarify. Which, if any, of the following would you not put in the same category as advice about immigration consequences: advice about consequences for a conviction for a sex offense, the loss of professional licensing or future employment opportunities, civil liability, tax liability, right to vote, right to bear arms. Are they all in the same category? Or do you -- do you draw a line some place?",
  "Have you ever heard or read a defense summation that was more derogatory of the defendant than the summation here?",
  "But defense counsel -­",
  "-- goes so far as to say: Don't look to him for sympathy because he demands none. But isn't that exactly what he has to appeal for in order not to get a death verdict, sympathy based on -­ on mental illness, despite the horrific crimes that this person committed and the things that he said on the stand.",
  "Well, I think that assumes that the State courts are -- what the Supreme Court of Ohio and all the other State supreme courts are doing is waiving briefs for Federal habeas courts.",
  "Do you think that's what AEDPA was intended to do?",
  "Well, what is your answer to the first question that Justice Sotomayor asked? Half of you say that -- that the State court's decision was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly-established Federal laws determined by the Supreme Court of the United States, i.e., Mills v. Maryland, when Mills v. Maryland hadn't been decided.",
  "And are there -- are there not quite a few instances of contrary statements in our opinions?",
  "As to the -- as to the time when the -- the law has to be clearly established by a decision in that court.",
  "This Court has not said that clearly established Federal law refers to this Court's decision as of the time of the relevant State court decision.",
  "Well, has there ever been a case in which this Court has considered the merits of a dispute where the individual claims of the named plaintiffs expired before we heard argument and a -- and a class had not yet been certified?",
  "No, but that wasn't my question. The class has not yet been certified, has it?",
  "And the -- the claims of all the named plaintiffs are -- have expired?",
  "I ask you this about the government's interest involved here and the practicality of the situation, and I want to put aside the innocent owner defense, which I hope to ask your adversary about. But putting that aside, let's take what I envision as sort of the typical case where the police officer arrests someone in a vehicle for a drug offense and -- without a warrant -- and then has to file a complaint in court. What -- what is the government -- what is the burden on the government, and what would be the burden on Chicago or the State of Illinois in a requirement that within some reasonably brief period of time after that that there must be the equivalent of the filing of a complaint in court, just as you would for the arrest of an individual without a warrant, where the only issue would be whether there was probable cause for the seizure, not whether there, you know, is some innocent owner defense, but just whether there’s probable cause?",
  "May I ask you --",
  "-- exactly what you think needs to take place at this hearing? And the hearing you think has to take place within 10 days? Is that your figure?",
  "Well, whatever the period is: 10 days, 14 days, whatever. Some short period.",
  "I have two questions: Must it be an adversarial hearing, and must the State disprove the innocent owner defense?",
  "Well, but my understanding of Krimstock is that a lot of those seizures –- and others know more about this than I do -- were for DWI, and that it is possible to assert an innocent owner defense there. And that's where I see a great impracticality in this. I -- I don't see how you can expect the State to come into court within such a short period and have any burden of contesting an innocent owner defense without compromising a criminal investigation.",
  "Well, let me give you this example which is pretty much based on something that you –- you wrote in your own brief. Joe is arrested on a drug offense driving a car, and there are drugs in the car. But Joe isn't the owner of the car; John is the owner of the car. Then John comes in 10 days later or 14 days later and says, well, you know, I never had any inkling that Joe was using the car to deal in drugs and had no reason to know that. And you think that within that short period of time the State has to disprove that, you know, that John didn't have --",
  "-- reason to believe that Joe was involved in drug dealing?",
  "Well, the situation is much worse than that, that they don't have the -- that they need time to investigate. They may have the registered owner under investigation. They may think he is involved in the drug conspiracy as well. They may have him on wiretaps. They may be preparing to arrest him. Now, you want to force them to come into court within 10 or 14 days and disclose the details of a -- of a pending criminal investigation and prepare to -- that makes a great --",
  "Well, then I don't understand how this -- how you can possibly have the innocent owner issue adjudicated at this quick hearing. I can understand the argument that you have to have the filing of the equivalent of a -- of a complaint when you -- that has to be filed when someone is arrested without a warrant, where it's not adversarial and you establish probable cause for the seizure. But when you start to go beyond that in drug forfeiture cases, at least, not -- not DWI cases, I just don't see how that's workable.",
  "But sometimes there’s a great advantage in doing things mechanically, because it -- it provides an element of fairness. And I’ll tell you what troubles me about this, and maybe you can convince me that I shouldn't be troubled by it. Here the district judge in effect takes four plus million dollars from the taxpayers of Georgia and -- and awards it above the lodestar calculation to these attorneys and says -- and I -- I certainly take him at his word -- this was the best performance I have seen in 28 years. But it seems totally standardless, and I see no way of policing it, and I see a great danger that trial judges are going to use this as a way of favoring their favorite nonprofit foundation or their favorite cause or their favorite attorneys, because they think they generally do good work. And this is not -- this is not like private litigation where the money is coming out of the pocket of a corporation. It's coming out of the pocket of taxpayers. So that is very troubling. And I don't know how you can provide standards for determining whether this kind of transfer is based on anything reasonable.",
  "Maybe -- maybe your perspective has changed too, Mr. Clement.",
  "But your argument is that, you know, for $495 an hour you really can't get a good lawyer? You need to have -- you need to pay more than that?",
  "But you, yourself, make the point in your brief that the -- that legal fees are changing. And do you think that’s relevant? Are they going up? Or are they going down now?",
  "When I look at that number, I -- and maybe I don't understand this, so maybe you or your adversary can clarify it for me. But when I look at that number, it seems to me there are two ways to interpret it. One is that she is saying: I want the full amount that I'm allowed by law. And the other is: That I want the value of my equipment, and it just so happens to total exactly to the dollar the amount that I'm entitled to by law. Am I correct that those are the two possible readings of that?",
  "And the question is which of those is the more plausible reading?",
  "Well, when she put down the figure $10,718 on page 58a of the Joint Appendix, what did she mean by that?",
  "Yes.",
  "She meant that that was --",
  "She had -- she had figured out the value of the property, and her estimation of its fair market value was $10,718?",
  "It wasn't $10,717? It wasn't $10,719? It was $10,718? That's what she meant?",
  "But that's a -- that's a totally different question. It’s just -- it is –- your submission is that it is a pure coincidence that her good faith estimation of the current market value of this property just happens to add up, to the dollar, to the amounts that she was entitled to exempt under the specific statutory provisions that she cited in the previous column?",
  "Is there any other area of the law in which the parties to a contract can, in effect, dictate the substantive standard of administrative review for challenges raised by nonparties?",
  "Putting aside the fact that the Jenkins Act information would be sent to the State rather than the city, why -- how can you -- how can it be said that at this stage of the litigation that it's farfetched that having a statement on the website \"No taxes due\" is -- doesn't cause people to purchase those cigarettes for the very purpose of avoiding the taxes?",
  "Why isn't that just a question -- a substantive fraud question, rather than a proximate cause question?",
  "Is it -- is it fraudulent to say \"sales are tax-free\" as opposed to, you know, saying no taxes are due?",
  "In order to -- in order to -- to prevail on that theory, would you have to prove that these -- these alleged misrepresentations in fact caused people not to pay taxes?",
  "You would have -- you would have to prove that?",
  "And you think you could prove that?",
  "What -- what percentage of the -- of the residents of New York State or New York City voluntarily pay a use tax on their income tax returns for items that they purchase on the Internet?",
  "Would you make a guess?",
  "I don't see a difference - - would appreciate if you would tell me the difference between your argument as to this situation and the typical Internet site where I think a lot of people buy goods on the Internet, because they're convenient and also because they know that they're not going to have to pay State sales tax when they make those purchases.",
  "You have a company that is selling televisions, cameras, whatever over the Internet and they -- you know, you put your -- you put in your credit card information or whatever, and then it tells you, \"sales tax due,\" and if they have no outlet in the State, it says \"sales taxes due: Zero.\" What is the difference between that situation and this situation?",
  "When the issue, when the - - the claim is based on the evaluation of the truthfulness of a witness who eventually testifies at trial, where's the line to be drawn between the investigative stage and the prosecutorial stage?",
  "What concerns me about your argument is the -- is a real fear that it will eviscerate Imbler. Now, maybe you can convince me that it will not have that effect, but as the Solicitor General argued at the end of his argument, a very -- in the typical criminal case, the witnesses are not John Q. Public with -- who have never engaged in any wrongful activity. A typical witness is -- well, let's take the case of the prosecution of a -- a white -- of the CEO of a huge corporation for insider trading or some other white-collar violation. And the chief witness against this person is, let's say, the CFO of this company, who when initially questioned by law enforcement officials and investigatory officials, made -- made statements denying any participation in any wrongdoing, but eventually changed his story and testifies against the CEO at trial in exchange for consideration in a plea deal. Now, your argument, in a case like that - - or you could change the facts, make it an organized crime case, make it a prosecution of a drug kingpin who's testifying -- the witness against him is a lower-ranking person in the organization who has a criminal record, maybe has previously committed perjury, has made numerous false statements, is subject to impeachment. In all of those cases a claim could be brought against the prosecutor.",
  "Well, I mean, that might be true as an empirical matter, but I don't understand why it would be hard to allege.",
  "What would you have to allege to get by Iqbal or to get by summary judgment? You allege that the testimony at trial was false and that the prosecutor knew that it was false. And in support of that you have prior inconsistent statements by the witness, and you may have the evidence that was introduced by the defense at trial that is inconsistent with that. You have a triable issue.",
  "You certainly get by 12(b)(6).",
  "Why is it difficult to allege fabrication? The -- the allegation is that at point A this witness denied that the defendant did anything wrong, and then at point B the defendant told an entirely different story after having received from the government a plea deal that promises no prosecution and entry into the witness protection program or something like that. That certainly is sufficient evidence to -- of fabrication, is it not?",
  "That's an entirely false picture of the way any sophisticated prosecution is handled today, completely false. You want -- the prosecutor may not know whether there's probable cause until the prosecutor interviews the witness.",
  "And so then you have to go back and determine whether there was -- if there wasn't probable cause before the interview, then there is liability. But if there was probable cause before the interview, then there isn't liability.",
  "Before the re-interview, because the prosecutor doesn't want to take the case to the grand jury before looking this witness in the eye and seeing whether this -- this guy who's got a lot of impeachment baggage is -- is a -- is a credible witness.",
  "In -- in answer to Justice Breyer's question, would -- would it be a -- would it be practical and conceptually correct to draw the line at the stage at which the prosecutor is interviewing witnesses to evaluate credibility? So, at that stage, the prosecutorial function has begun and absolute immunity would kick in.",
  "Not on whether there is probable cause because probable cause is -- is evanescent. It comes, and it goes. It is -- it is - - it is inextricably intertwined with what the prosecutor is doing in questioning the witness.",
  "But with a line toward investigating credibility for use at a trial, which is -- which is, at that point, foreordained, but, if the evaluation is being done for the purpose of determining whether there should be a trial, then, no. That's your answer?",
  "Why is this question properly before us in this case? The argument that you seem to be making, and it's an argument to which you devote a lot of your brief, seems to be that the -- the State courts unreasonably applied Strickland to the performance of the attorneys at the penalty phase. Now, that is a, a (d)(1) argument, 2254(d)(1). But the two questions on which cert were granted have to do with findings of fact. So they have to do with (d)(2) and (e)(1) and not (d)(1) at all.",
  "But that's an entirely different question. I think that's the question. Did the validity of the -- the conclusion made by the State courts that there was a strategic decision not to present this evidence until the -- the final judge stage of the -- of the proceeding, and not whether there was a reasonable investigation or whether they -- there was reasonable performance overall at the penalty phase. It's purely this question of the validity of a finding of historical fact and how that is to be evaluated under -- under (d), under (d)(2) and (e)(1).",
  "Well, let me give you an example involving exactly those two provisions and facts very similar to the facts here. The State court finds that a strategic decision was made, and that raises a question under (d)(2): Was the State court's rejection of the Strickland claim the result of a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding? There are also a host of subsidiary findings of historical fact because the attorneys testify and documents are produced, and there are conflicts in the testimony. And so there's a question of did -- did Dozier and Ralph talk about this on a particular day? Did Trotter write a letter to so-and-so? And so forth. So you've got all these subsidiary -- all these findings of historical fact, and they are to be reviewed under (e)(1), under the plain language of (e)(1).",
  "And then after they're reviewed under the plain language of (e)(1), you turn to the question under (d)(2), which is whether the decision about whether there was a strategic decision was based on -- based on an unreasonable determination of facts.",
  "So there's no conflict.",
  "You’re making a --",
  "And you are making a per se argument, no? You can imagine someone who is a month short of his 18th birthday, and you are saying that, no matter what this person does, commits the most horrible series of non-homicide offenses that you can imagine, a whole series of brutal rapes, assaults that render the -- the victim paraplegic but not dead, no matter what, the person is sentenced shows no remorse whatsoever, the worst case you can possibly imagine, cannot -- that person must at some point be made eligible for parole. That's your argument?",
  "If we agree with you --",
  "If we agree with you, at what point must the parole consideration be given? There is a suggestion in your brief that maybe the Colorado statute, which says that a person can get parole consideration after 40 years, would be constitutional. Is that your position?",
  "But Florida has abolished parole, has it not, going forward?",
  "So eventually, if things are allowed to take their course, the Florida parole board will go out of business.",
  "And why isn't the -- the most sensible way to deal with the problem that you are raising, the one that the Chief Justice suggested, to permit as-applied proportionality challenges that take into account the particular circumstances of the juvenile in question, rather than this per se rule that you are advocating, which would deprive the State of Florida from reaching the judgment that there are some -- there are some juveniles, some individuals who are short of their 18th birthday, who cannot -- who deserve imprisonment in -- life imprisonment without parole? Some of the actual cases that -- in which this sentence has been imposed in Florida involve factual situations that are so horrible that I couldn't have imagined them if I hadn't actually seen them. Raping an 8-year-old girl and burying her alive. Are you familiar with that case?",
  "Raping a woman in front of her 12-year-old son and then forcing the son to engage in sexual conduct with the mother. Are you familiar with that case?",
  "But do you know anybody who is willing to say that, as a categorical matter, that -- you know, the 18th birthday is the magical date for every single person?",
  "Because the Court, up to this point, has said that death is different, and the rules -- the Eighth Amendment rules in capital cases are entirely different from the Eighth Amendment rules in -- in all other cases.",
  "If we -- you know, if we abandon that, then one of two things has to happen, either the rules for noncapital cases have to change dramatically, or the rules for capital cases have to change dramatically, unless death is different, in fact.",
  "I know you are not asking for that, but that -- isn't that where this, logically, is going? If death is not different, then there should be uniform rules across the board.",
  "Why does it say that? Why doesn't it just say that, in this particular case, what this individual has done is so bad that, even if this person can be rehabilitated and would not present a danger to -- to society at age 60 or 70, that this person is -- should be sentenced to life without parole? That's -- that's what it means for an adult offender.",
  "Your argument is that because the -- the State judge had to decide whether Roper dictated or required the result that you were asking for, that -- that it's not an independent State ground. That's the argument?",
  "No, but I'm -- I'm interested in how we decide whether it's independent. If you had cited -- if you said Marbury v. Madison dictates this result, well, the judge would have to decide what Marbury v. Madison required. That’s a Federal -- that can be characterized as a Federal question. That would make the -- that would make it -- the State law ground not an independent ground?",
  "What is the categorical rule that you would like us to adopt?",
  "What is your response to the State's argument that these statistics are not peer-reviewed? And these are statistics, am I right, that you generated yourself?",
  "And you address this in footnote 35 of your reply brief, and it would have been a little bit helpful if you had raised it initially, so that the State would have had an opportunity to reply, but you introduced the citation there with “for example,” and then you cite some cases. Are there others?",
  "There are -- there are other cases in which the lower Florida courts have used -- have said that this particular subsection is appropriate for raising a constitutional challenge.",
  "Near -- near the end of your Brief, you argue that -- that the patent here is -- is not -- is unpatentable on the independent ground that it would pre-empt the abstract idea of hedging consumption risk. If you -- if you are right about that, is this a good case for us to get into these –- into the very broad issue that Petitioner has raised?",
  "I didn't do the math fast enough in my head when you were answering Justice Kennedy's question, but is he correct that the effect of accepting your argument is about 2,000 additional appeals that -- that the Department of Justice will have to brief and the courts of appeals will have to decide?",
  "Yes. On the assumptions that you made, do you know what the -- the result is?",
  "In your view, must an administrative report be a report that is generated by some government unit? Could it be a report by the administration of a university, for example?",
  "But I'm not sure why. You -- if -- unless \"administrative\" is informed by the other adjectives in that prepositional phrase, \"in a congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office,\" presumably GAO, \"report,\" it -- unless that is the -- you know, unless it's informed by those other references, and that's why it has to be governmental, I'm not sure how you limit \"administrative\" to governmental reports.",
  "You think the Federal Government is focusing on everything that is disclosed in every civil proceeding that occurs in Federal court?",
  "Suppose that the second phrase said \"in a congressional, news media, or GAO report.\" Would you read \"news media\" to be governmental?",
  "What's the difference between that and the way it's phrased now?",
  "No, no. Right now we have \"in a congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office report.\" And you say you have to read \"administrative\" in light of \"congressional\" and \"GAO.\" But what if it said \"in a congressional, news media, or Government Accounting Office report\"?",
  "Why wouldn't you make the same argument with relation to \"news media\"?",
  "Why is that?",
  "Your arguing that if the -- if the plaintiffs' attorneys made diligent investigation, they would have uncovered facts about the safety of Vioxx that the FDA was unaware of?",
  "Because the FDA never took any action during this period, other than changing the label.",
  "Well, if actual knowledge means things that the plaintiff doesn't actually know, then I don't know what the difference is between actual knowledge and constructive knowledge. It's a meaningless distinction if that's how actual knowledge is defined.",
  "Well, what is the problem --",
  "What is wrong with the -- with the inquiry notice rule that the court of appeals in this case set out on pages 29a to 30a of the joint appendix? This is from a Seventh Circuit -- quoting from a Seventh Circuit decision: \"The facts constituting inquiry notice must be sufficiently probative of fraud, sufficiently advanced beyond the stage of a mere suspicion, sufficiently confirmed or substantiated, not only to incite the victim to investigate but also to enable him to tie up any loose ends and complete the investigation in time to file a timely suit.\" So that the statute would run upon inquiry notice, provided that within the 2-year period, the plaintiff could, if the plaintiff diligently investigated, find sufficient facts to -- to file a complaint that would satisfy -- satisfy the PLRA?",
  "Now, your -- your position is that the statute begins to run at the time when a -- a plaintiff is -- has constructive knowledge, at least, of information that would be sufficient to file a complaint that would satisfy the PLRA?",
  "Well, my question -- why, then, did Congress allow 2 years after that? At that point, the plaintiff has everything that’s necessary to file a complaint. So why does the plaintiff need 2 years after that point?",
  "Was there also a substantial support in the lower court case law prior to the enactment of this provision for the existence of inquiry notice? And is that therefore also incorporated into this?",
  "But, under your position, as -- the concept of inquiry notice becomes essentially very unimportant, if not completely meaningless. You just ask at what point would a reasonably diligent investor have obtained knowledge of the necessary facts. And so, what difference does it make when a person was put on inquiry notice?",
  "Why does the --",
  "What do you think that means? What do you think \"in contemplation of bankruptcy\" means?",
  "Well, let's say someone goes to the lawyer and they discuss the person's debt situation and the decision is made that a bankruptcy petition is going to be filed at some future date. Do you think that everything that that person does after that point is done in contemplation of bankruptcy?",
  "Well then, why not? The person drives home in contemplation of bankruptcy, the person has lunch in contemplation of bankruptcy.",
  "Doesn't it mean -- \"in contemplation of bankruptcy\" means because of the expectation of filing a bankruptcy petition later?",
  "If a law firm -- if a law firm provides representation for debtors in bankruptcy, what is misleading about requiring them to say: We help people file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code?",
  "Isn't something in contemplation of bankruptcy done only -- isn't something done in contemplation of bankruptcy only if it is done because of the anticipation of filing a bankruptcy petition? So that if -- if a person takes on additional debt in order to obtain life-saving treatment, that is not done in contemplation of bankruptcy; it's not done because of the bankruptcy. It's done because there is an emergency that requires immediate expenditures.",
  "But isn't it misleading for an attorney to say, I'm a -- I'm a debt relief agency? Nobody is going to know what a debt relief agency is, unless they are familiar with this statute.",
  "A perspective client looks at that, and they say, well, I don't want a debt relief agency, I want a lawyer.",
  "That's misleading.",
  "What if there’s no objection? The bankruptcy judge sees a chapter 13 plan, and it -- it provides for the discharge of student debt; it covers student debt. It's labeled \"student debt.\" Is it improper for the bankruptcy judge to say you can't do this by this mechanism, you have to start an adversary proceeding?",
  "Was the Ninth Circuit correct in saying that an attorney can't be sanctioned under the bankruptcy rules' equivalent version of Rule 11, for attempting to sneak through a discharge of student debt in a chapter 13 petition?",
  "No, I understand that. But in the absence of circuit -- controlling circuit precedent, is it -- can an attorney be sanctioned for attempting to get the discharge of student debt through a chapter 13 petition, knowing, as I assume every bankruptcy attorney knows, that that is not the proper way to attempt to get discharge of a student debt -- student loan?",
  "I am not interested in what Ninth Circuit law is.",
  "No, I'm asking you -- I'm asking you, under -- under Bankruptcy Rule 9011.",
  "And why isn't it a fundamental --",
  "Why isn't it a fundamental change in Florida property law to extend these concepts of accretion and avulsion to things that are done by the State? If someone owns beachfront property, they accept -- they -- they understand the risk that a hurricane may cause avulsion, a hurricane may knock down their house. Does that mean the State could come in and knock down the house and say this is an artificial avulsion?",
  "Well, what's the difference? You're taking a concept that has to do with a risk that you bear because of the -- the vagaries of -- of the weather and storms, and you're applying it to something that's done by the State.",
  "Yes, talking about a label, and putting the avulsion label and the accretion label on something that the State does, doesn't -- doesn't eliminate the fact that there's been a fundamental change. You have taken a doctrine that applies to things that occur as a result of nature and you've applied it to things that are produced by the State.",
  "Well, suppose that -- suppose that a city decided that it wanted to attract more students who are going to the beach in Florida for spring break, and so therefore it decided it was going to create a huge beach in front of -- of privately owned homes. Under the decision of the Florida Supreme Court, I don't see anything that would stop the city from doing that. So you could have -- you could have televised spring break beach parties in front of -- of somebody's house. Now, in -- as a practical matter, doesn't that have a real effect on the value of the property?",
  "No, I understand that, but if the -- but the Florida Supreme Court said that there isn't any right -- if there is a manmade extension of the beach, there is no right to exclude people from it; it's -- the beach is owned by the State. So all of that could take place, couldn't it?",
  "Can I just ask you this, Mr. Kneedler, before your time expires, what -- I agree, Martin v. Busch seems to be the case that's most -- provides the greatest support for what the Florida Supreme Court did here. But what do we do about the fact that the Florida Supreme Court didn't rely on it?",
  "Do you think that the average person hearing this warning would envision the sort of procedure that occurs before a grand jury?",
  "That's what it would be taken to mean?",
  "If this warning is read the way we might -- lawyers might read a statute or a contract or something like that, then I don't know why saying, \"You have the right to remain silent,\" isn't potentially misleading. It says you have the right to remain silent. But once you break your silence, there is nothing in there that says you have the right to resume your silence.",
  "Would you agree with that?",
  "Do you think that is defective, too?",
  "So once you break your -- you have the right to remain silent, but once you break that right, the fact that you have that right to use that right to remain silent in the future doesn't mean you can stop answering questions.",
  "Well, you said that the average person wouldn't take this warning to mean -- to -- wouldn't envision a procedure like the grand jury procedure. What does it mislead the average person to think?",
  "But the latter part of that is the grand jury question. You have a right to consult an attorney, but you don't have the right to have an attorney present.",
  "Okay. So then your argument is that this -- that what -- what a normal -- an average person would take this to mean is that you -- you can talk an -- to an attorney before starting to answer questions, but not once the questioning begins. That's what you take it to mean?",
  "Well, all of those people are lawyers, and lawyers are known to read legal documents very precisely. The average person may read them very differently.",
  "As a practical matter, does the President have any ability to control what the board does?",
  "Well, why is that --",
  "Well, let me give you an example. Suppose the President objects to the -- the very large salaries that the members of the board receive. What are their salaries?",
  "And they -- did they decide that themselves?",
  "Suppose the President reads about this and he says: This is outrageous; I want to change it. How can he do that? Remove --",
  "-- remove that -- remove the SEC commissioners unless they take action against the board?",
  "Well, do you dispute the proposition that the more layers of for-cause removal you add, the -- the less control the President has? Suppose there were five layers.",
  "I mean, the mail fraud statute carries a very heavy penalty, and are you -- you are arguing that Congress intended to impose this penalty on individuals who breach some Federal or State disclosure requirement, even if that is viewed by the body that is responsible for the disclosure requirement as a very minor thing.",
  "But that's what you’re asking us to do. I understand you are saying that -- that there cannot be a conviction without the violation of some duty. But if we agree with that, then we are going down the road of deciding what sort of duty suffices, and does it have to be a duty that is backed up by a State criminal sanction? What if -- what if it's a 1-year felony? What if it's a misdemeanor? What if it's a -- simply a civil penalty? What if it's simply some sort of precatory code of ethics --",
  "-- for legislators?",
  "What if there's a statute that prohibits a legislator from engaging in certain conduct and attaches a significant penalty to it, but there is no statute that requires the disclosure of the conduct?",
  "I imagine -- I'm sorry. I imagine legislators must vote on all sorts of things that have a -- an impact on their own financial interests or the financial interests of their family or associates. For example, suppose this -- the Petitioner was a practicing attorney. Suppose he’s voting on an overhaul of the rules of civil procedure, and some of them may benefit him and his practice. Or suppose he’s voting on a new tax code, and the provisions may benefit him or his family or his associates in a -- in a variety of ways. Don't you need some kind of a disclosure code to separate the things that have to be disclosed from the things that don't have to be disclosed, because they are just too common?",
  "Well, since the -- since the body of pre-McNally lower court cases was hardly completely consistent, do you think this is a workable approach?",
  "Could you just take a moment and explain why any error in the honest services instruction wasn't harmless as applied to the Forum/Paxton transaction?",
  "Yes.",
  "As I understand it, there was no evidence there that the $600,000 was a -- a recharacterized management fee; isn't that correct?",
  "Didn't you just --",
  "Didn't you just say that the parties agreed that there was no meeting of the minds on this issue?",
  "What is your understanding of what Mr. Persky says at 77a of the joint appendix? He was -- I take it he was counsel for AnimalFeeds? Is that right?",
  "And he says all the parties agree that when a contract is silent on an issue, there has been no agreement that has been reached on that issue; therefore, there has been no agreement to bar class arbitrations.",
  "So then I don't understand what issue there was for the arbitrator to -- arbitrators to decide --",
  "-- other than to impose a rule like the rule that had been adopted by South Carolina. But that would not be within their power, unless they could presumably find that rule in Federal maritime law or New York law.",
  "So what was the issue for them to decide?",
  "It's not clear to me what your answer to these questions is. If all the prosecution does is call the analyst on the stand and admit -- have the analyst provide a foundation for the admission of the report, let's say, pursuant to the hearsay exception for recorded recollection, and does nothing more, would there be a Confrontation Clause problem?",
  "What's the difference between that situation and the situation in which the report is -- is admitted, subject to -- and the analyst is available, and the defense can question the analyst if the defense wishes to?",
  "How can you say that? We have an amicus brief from 26 States plus the District of Columbia arguing exactly the contrary.",
  "They say that there is a very substantial category of cases in which defendants really have no interest whatsoever in contesting either the nature or the quantity of drugs involved, but they will refuse to stipulate to those things simply for the purpose of putting a financial burden on the prosecution, because they know, if they do that, it may be helpful for them in getting a better plea bargain, plus there is a certain risk that the analyst will not show up, and they will get the benefit of that.",
  "If this is not a burden on these 26 States plus the District of Columbia, why are they bothering to make this argument? Just for amusement?",
  "Well, does that square with where we started out? We have situation A, where the prosecutor calls the lab analyst, and the lab analyst says, this is my report, and I stand by it, period. Now, it's up to the defense to cross-examine. That's situation A. Situation B is the report is admitted without the analyst present, but the defense can then -- without the analyst on the stand --",
  "But the defense can then cross-examine the analyst.",
  "There’s such a slight difference between those two situations. Now, how is that a fundamental transformation of the way Anglo-American trials are conducted?",
  "No. Let's just not get beyond the facts of this case, where all -- all that we are dealing with is a -- an analyst's report relating to the -- the nature of the substance that was tested and, if it's a controlled substance, the amount. That's it. It doesn't extend to anything else, videotapes or anything more. There’s such a slight difference between those two situations.",
  "But I take it your position is it wouldn't matter. If the -- if Virginia said that the -- the Commonwealth bears the risk of a no-show, that wouldn't make any difference?",
  "So we have to assume that that's the case.",
  "Well, would you like us --",
  "Would you like us to grant, vacate, and remand in this case and say because it's unclear who has the risk of a no-show?",
  "And then Supreme Court of Virginia on remand could decide whether in fact the -- the prosecution bore that risk?",
  "Do you think Melendez-Diaz addressed the question of the order of proof? Where did it address that?",
  "What is your position -- what do you say that the States contemplated regarding the financing of these -- of these projects? That the State that was unfortunate enough to be selected as the second State would have to pay the full cost, even if it was $200 million, and then would -- how long would it take for that State to get that money back? Would it have to wait until, you know, 80, 100 years later to get the benefit of some other State having to finance a project?",
  "Isn’t it the case that --",
  "Well, I was going to ask, is it the case that the unwillingness of States to step into this area in these instances is a consequence, at least in part and perhaps in large part, of the Federal incarceration, that as a result of the Federal incarceration, the person is no longer viewed by the State as -- as having domicile within the State, the State of prior domicile has no way of knowing whether that person would return to a domicile in the prior State? Is that -- do you think that is a fair understanding of the reason for the enactment of this?",
  "But do you -- do you think that the Congress has the power to remedy problems that are caused by the operation of the Federal prison system, caused by incarceration?",
  "What about the general proposition that if -- if the incarceration causes a problem, then the Federal Government has the power, ancillary to the power to operate the -- the criminal justice system, to remedy the problems that it has caused by the incarceration?",
  "Why as a matter of constitutional law does it end at that point?",
  "Well, what if the person is simply injured in prison as a result of, let's say, an attack by another prisoner, and now the sentence expires. The Federal Government has no power to set up hospitals or facilities to care for that person for the duration of the -- of the injury that’s -- that was caused during the period of incarceration?",
  "Could you explain why the constitutional power that provides the basis for a Federal criminal conviction is exhausted at the end of the -- either the maximum term of imprisonment that Congress chooses to establish when it enacts the statute or at the end of the particular term that is given to this prisoner? I understand why it's relevant for statutory purposes. It may be relevant for other constitutional purposes -- double jeopardy and due process -- but why as a -- why does the power, the Commerce Clause power, the power to make rules for Federal property and so forth, why is that exhausted at the end of the -- either of those two periods? I don't quite understand that.",
  "Well, only to the extent that that's what the statute says. Take whatever the offense is, would it be a violation of the Necessary and Proper Clause? Let's say it's a commerce -- it's based on the Commerce Clause. Would Congress exceed it's powers under the Commerce Clause if it imposed a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole? I mean it raises other constitutional questions, but why does it raise a question as to the extent of the power that’s being exercised by -- by Congress?",
  "Well, suppose there’s a court order that prohibits the -- one of the parents -- the parent with whom the child lives most of the time from moving more than an hour's drive from the prior place of residence, would that be -- would -- would the -- the other parent then have custody?",
  "Suppose the court order says that the -- that the child may not move from the house where the child lives now. Would that be custody?",
  "Well, what’s the meaning of the phrase \"determine the place of residence\"?",
  "Well, okay. So, if -- it there’s a court order that says the child shall not move from 123 Maple Street without the consent of both parents, do both parents then have custody?",
  "Which is more important, determining the house in which the child is going to live or determining the country in which the child is going to live?",
  "Why would the signatories of this convention have wanted to regard a parent as having custodial rights if the parent has the right to veto a change of address within a country, but not when the parent has the authority to veto the future nationality and cultural background of the child?",
  "I don't want to belabor the point too much, but maybe you could just give me an example of a court order that you believe would give a parent the right to determine place of residence and, therefore, would constitute custody within the meaning of the convention.",
  "Even if the -- even if the error of law is completely reasonable? Let's say in this case the Sixth Circuit had a case directly on point. Still, it was just too bad.",
  "Do you think that a -- a mistake of law has to be substantively reasonable in order to fall within this defense, and if so, where do you get that? Where do you find that in the statute?",
  "Well, suppose that a lawyer spends a whole week researching a question, but arrives at a conclusion that is plainly incorrect, does not, therefore, intend to violate the statute and proceeds in good faith. Would that -- how would that work out?",
  "It would be an unreasonable decision, and yet, would it -- it would fall within your understanding of this provision; is that correct?",
  "Well, let me give you another example that you mention in your brief. The NFL teams agree among themselves regarding scheduling: They’ll play 16 games a year and they will have a playoff schedule and they won't play any other games. Now, would that be a clear case under the rule of reason? You mention and some of your amici mention that, for example, the English football leagues operate very differently.",
  "Well, what if one of the team wants -- one of the teams wants to play additional games --",
  "-- against a rival team where they will get more money?",
  "Well, then you could have sued on an agency claim, couldn't you?",
  "Am I correct that neither you, neither Granite Rock nor the local, thinks that the December collective bargaining agreement really was fully retroactive? They don't think it was --",
  "-- it meant that the no­ strike clause was in effect on the day when the old collective bargaining agreement expired, and you don't think that the new arbitration clause was in effect on the day when the old collective bargaining agreement expired, or do I not understand your positions?",
  "And you say no, but what do you say about the -- but you say that the arbitration clause was intended to be retroactive.",
  "But you say that the arbitration clause -- or do you? -- in the later -- in the agreement that was ratified in December was retroactive?",
  "Neither one is retroactive?",
  "No, I understand that. I've having difficulty -- can we just put the December -- in the view of both sides, can we just put the December agreement aside? It has nothing to do with the argument that's before us. The argument before us has to do with the -- whether there was a ratification on July the 2nd.",
  "So in substance, you -- you think that the arbitrator would decide the issue of contract formation, whether --",
  "Well, I thought you just said that the arbitrator would decide whether there was an agreement on July the 2nd.",
  "But that would be an issue for the -- you think that that would be an issue for the arbitrator to decide, whether there was a contract ratified on July the 2nd?",
  "And if the arbitrator thought that it was in existence on July 2nd, then --",
  "-- you would lose?",
  "So that's an issue of contract formation; is it not? In substance it is.",
  "Well, what is the government’s --",
  "Well, what is -- what is the difference between your understanding of an implicit termination, which is what I take it you have just been describing, and a constructive termination?",
  "So if the franchisor completely refuses to supply gas, that's an implicit termination?",
  "But if he charges $1,000 a gallon, that's not a termination?",
  "If the conduct on the part of the franchisor is raising the price of gas, how does the factfinder determine whether it's sufficient to justify a constructive termination? And assume that the franchisee leaves -- the price of gas is raised, and this particular franchisee says: I can't operate if gas is sold to me at that price. What's the standard for determining whether there was a constructive termination?",
  "But what's a reasonable franchisee in that situation? Presumably some have a small profit margin; some have a bigger profit margin. Some could operate if the price of gas is raised; some could not. How is that to be determined?",
  "You are putting a jury in sort of the situation of a -- of a rate regulator, aren't you, if you do that?",
  "Was it a reasonable rate?",
  "Well, what are these --",
  "Now, these Petitioners remained in -- in business, is -- that's right?",
  "Did they make money during this period?",
  "All but one remained in business, isn't that correct?",
  "What does that mean, \"effectively eliminated\"? The -- the First Circuit said, if \"the breach of the lease was such a material change that it effectively ended the lease, even though the plaintiffs continued to operate the business\" -- I have no idea what that means. What does it mean to effectively end the lease even though the lease continues?",
  "I know, but could you put that in somewhat more concrete terms, or can you not get any more specific than to say the lease is effectively ended?",
  "The statistical issue is very interesting, but I -- I wonder, if we were not looking at this through AEDPA, why we -- why a court should necessarily have to start with the question -- with the elements of the prima facie -- with the question of whether there is unconstitutional underrepresentation, when in the end, as I understand Duren, the defendant has to identify some aspect of the jury selection process that has a disproportionate impact on the group involved and is unreasonable? And unless that can be done at the outset, why struggle with these statistics? Now, here, to illustrate, the aspect of the jury selection process that the Sixth Circuit thought was unreasonable was the prior practice of choosing the jurors first for the district courts, the misdemeanor courts, rather than the circuit courts, the -- the felony courts. But the -- the trial judge, it seemed to me, address this in -- in a very thoughtful way, and he said there just isn't any proof that this old system had that effect. And it's hard for me to see how it could have that effect, unless the -- the number of jurors chosen for the district courts in Grand Rapids was disproportionate to the number chosen for the district courts in the other jurisdictions within the county. So that seems to me to be the end of the case. And why does it make sense to -- to struggle with this rather complicated statistical problem, if at the end of the day, it's going to come down to something of that nature?",
  "But concluding that it's systematic doesn't mean that the defendant wins. It just means that the State has to -- has to justify the -- the mechanism that's causing -- that's causing this -- this situation.",
  "It says that the State has to show that it has a reason, a good reason, for -- the aspect of the selection process that has been identified as causing the disparity. But does it say that it's the State's obligation to go through every factor that may cause the disparity and justify every one? Or is it the defendant's obligation to point to some aspect of the selection -- of the -- of the system that causes the disparity? Then once the defendant identifies that, then the State can show if it -- can try to show that there's a good reason for it.",
  "But that's the only factor that the Sixth Circuit identified as illegitimate, was this -- was this siphoning system.",
  "It rejected everything else, didn't it?",
  "Are there -- are there courts that you know of that do what you are suggesting needs to be done? When a juror does not show up, the judge issues a bench warrant, and -- and the police are sent out to arrest the person and drag the person into court, or somebody says, I am a single parent, and I have children, and I'm too poor to have a nanny or an au pair, and, therefore, please excuse me; and they say, no, you have to find some way of getting here. Are there courts that do that?",
  "Isn't that the case --",
  "If -- if Grand -- if Grand Rapids uses a disproportionate number of jurors in its district courts, then you are going to have this problem -- the only way to fix the problem would be to have a separate jury system for the district courts. If you have the -- the circuit courts going first, then the people in the district courts are going to have the problem that you identify. If you have a system in which it's all done randomly -- circuit court, district court -- the people who come toward the end are going to have the problem. So I don't see any way out of this, if in fact there was a statistical basis for it, other than having a separate selection process for the district courts. Is that what you think is necessary?",
  "Well, if there’s no --",
  "If there's no bad faith, then how many shots does the plan administrator -- who I don't think is named Sam -- gets to --",
  "-- to try to answer this question?",
  "If this is not a discretionary decision for the district court -- let's assume it's not a discretionary decision for the -- for the administrator. But if it's -- and if it's also not a discretionary decision for the district court, if what the district court is required to do is to say what the plan means, what would you suggest that the district court should have looked to, when the -- the provision, the -- the plan language that the district court has to look at is very bare bones?",
  "Well, Respondents say that this was a -- sure, it's a -- a benefit to them to be -- to have this offset only by the amount that they received and not take into account the time value of money, but this was an incentive that lured them into accepting employment again with Xerox.",
  "But even if the -- even if no deference was owed to the administrator, could you explain why the task for the district court was not then simply to interpret what the plan means? What puzzles me about -- something that puzzles me about the -- the two decisions by the Second Circuit are (a) why this is remedial; why isn't it just a reinterpretation of the plan; (b) where their -- what do equitable principles have to do with this; and why should it be a discretionary decision for the district court? What does the plan mean? That would be the issue. Isn't that the question, if there’s no deference due to the administrator?",
  "Well, if this is a discretionary decision for the court that finds the initial abuse of discretion by the administrator, what are the factors -- what are the relevant factors in determining whether the administrator should get a second shot and which ones are present in this case?",
  "Then I don't understand what the purpose of the remand from the Second Circuit to the district court, after the Second Circuit's first decision, was. In other words, you’re saying that they -- they found that anything other than an offset for the amount of money that was actually received by the beneficiary upon leaving Xerox would be -- would violate the notice requirements.",
  "So that interprets the plan. There’s nothing left to do, then.",
  "I understand you to be saying that the concept of any appreciation of that amount based on the time value of money is invalid, because there wasn't proper notice for that. So there’s nothing left to do on remand, it seems to me. I don't understand what the purpose of the remand was.",
  "Isn't it true that the Commissioner of Social Security in the past paid EAJA awards directly to attorneys and that this is still done in cases in which the client has assigned the payment to an attorney?",
  "What gives the Federal Government the right to override State law on that issue? Suppose the situation was that another creditor would have priority over the attorney if the money had been paid directly to the claimant. What gives the government the right, in effect, to override that by paying the money directly to the attorney, unless the government believes that this is payable to the attorney under -- under EAJA?",
  "Do you happen to know how much the -- the Treasury typically collects in a year under these EAJA offsets? Does it put a dent in the Federal deficit?",
  "Isn't this argument circular? The -- the issue is who is -- to whom is this payment to be made. And if it's to be made to the -- the claimant, then it's not for the beneficial interest of the -- of the attorney.",
  "Your position may -- may follow from the language of Title VII, but you began by saying that it also represents the best policy. And I wonder if you could explain why that is so. Here, the City of Chicago continued to use this test for quite a number of years after it was administered. And so as you interpret the statute, I gather that someone could still file a disparate impact claim 6 or 7 years after the test was first administered, and quite a few years after it was first used in making a hiring decision. And how can that be squared with Congress's evident desire in Title VII to require that an EEOC charge be filed rather promptly after the employment action is taken?",
  "Why would Congress have wanted to allow a question like this to be left open for such an extended period of time? Why would it not have wanted everybody who is potentially affected by it to understand where things stand at a much earlier point, at some reasonable period of time after all of the information is in the -- in the possession of a potential plaintiff to determine whether there has been a disparate impact and whether that -- that person is going to be adversely affected by it, particularly if at a later point the effect of a remedial decree can be to upset the employment -- the employment status of other people who have been hired in the interim?",
  "Well, somebody getting -- someone getting a letter that you sent to people who were qualified didn't know that. The only thing that I see that you sent to the people who fell into the qualified category was that it was unlikely, which I take it means less than 50 percent, that they would be called for further processing, but it was possible that they would be called for further processing. You didn't tell them anything about -- you didn't tell them that you were going to fill all of your available positions with people who were classified as well qualified in that letter --",
  "-- did you?",
  "Right. That's right.",
  "Well, why did the City say that it was planning to give a new test in 3 years and then wait more than a decade before giving a new test? If I received one of these qualified letters, and I also -- and I knew in addition that the City was going to give a test in 3 years, that might well affect my incentive about bringing a lawsuit to challenge this.",
  "But you don't challenge that.",
  "You don't challenge that. You now acknowledge that the Plaintiffs were treated unlawfully.",
  "And were you prejudiced by the delay in the filing of the EEOC charge?",
  "And that applies --",
  "And that goes for all forms of training? No form of training or expert assistance can be prohibited unless the individual specifically intends to further -- that the training will be used to carry out terrorist activities?",
  "Well, just out of curiosity, I thought your position was that no form of training or assistance could be prohibited -- -",
  "-- consistent with the First Amendment. That's not your position?",
  "And doesn't that lead to -- kind of logically lead to the conclusion that mere membership could be prohibited? Could you explain how someone could be a member of one of these organizations without providing a service to the organization? Simply by lending one's name as a member -- that might be regarded as a service. If you attended a meeting and you helped to arrange the chairs in advance or clean up afterwards, you’d be providing a service to the organization.",
  "Why is O'Brien the correct standard? How can you argue that training and providing advice is not speech?",
  "Mr. Rothfeld, I wondered if I could ask you about three interrelated points concerning your textual argument. And if I could just lay those on the table and get your reaction to them, I would appreciate it. The first is that it appears that there is a pretty universally accepted modern legislative drafting convention that statutes should be phrased in the present tense. The Senate drafting manual, for example, says: Always use the present tense unless the provision addresses only the past, the future, or a sequence of events that requires use of a different tense. And the House manual is to the same effect. The second is that when the section that's involved here, 2250, was drafted, the drafters didn't know whether SORNA would apply to pre-SORNA sex offense convictions. That was left up to the Attorney General. And so when they were drafting this, they had -- it was natural, perhaps, for them not to make a special provision for the possibility that there might be some pre-SORNA conduct involved. If the Attorney General had determined that only post-SORNA convictions would qualify, then only -- then the only travel that would qualify would be -- would be post-SORNA travel. It was only when the Attorney General decided that pre-SORNA convictions could qualify that the question that's presented here became a possibility. And the third is that once the Attorney General decided that SORNA would apply to pre-SORNA sex offense convictions, that necessarily meant that conduct constituting a -- a SORNA -- constituting a qualifying sex offense could occur in the past. And yet there are at least four provisions of SORNA that refer to the conduct that constitutes a sex offense and uses only the present tense, although in those instances it seems that those provisions have to be read as also covering past conduct, pre-SORNA conduct. These are all in 42 U.S.C. 16911, which is reproduced -- the relevant provisions are on 3a to 3-6 of the government's brief. I’ll just mention a couple of them to provide a flavor for this. Under 42 U.S.C. section 16911(3)(C), on 3a of the government's brief, an offense may qualify as a tier II offense if, among other things, it, quote, \"occurs after the offender becomes a tier I sex offender.\" But there \"occurs\" and \"becomes\" have to be read as applying to past conduct. 42 U.S.C. 1691(4) on the same page says that an offense may qualify as a tier III offense if, among other things, it involves a kidnapping of a minor. But \"involves\" there has to mean also “involved.” And the other two are subsection (7) on 5a and subsection (8) on 6a. So I wondered if you could comment on that. Maybe you have a reaction to it.",
  "I thought that the sequence argument that the government was making was that the events have to occur in this sequence: the conviction, the interstate travel, and the failure to register.",
  "Well, they might be wrong on that. And I understood that you agreed that the interstate travel has to take effect -- has to occur after the sex offense conviction. It wouldn't -- you couldn't violate -- you wouldn't violate SORNA if there’s interstate travel, then the conviction, and then the failure to register.",
  "Well, but they might be wrong that the sequence -- that the way these set out -- are set out in the statute dictates a temporal sequence --",
  "-- that you can argue that the temporal sequence that's necessary -- conviction, travel, failure to register -- follows from the purpose of this provision, which is to catch people who, after having committing a sex offense and being convicted of a sex offense in State A, move to State B. It would follow from the purpose of the statute, not necessarily from the sequence of subsections in this provision.",
  "Well, that makes -- that makes a lot of sense. But you can get that from the purpose of the statute, rather than from the sequence in which these elements are listed. Is it -- is it usually the case in a criminal statute that sets out a number of element that they have to be satisfied in some kind of temporal sequence? I'm not aware of that.",
  "Well, let's compare two cases. We have this case, where you have conviction, interstate travel, SORNA takes effect, failure to register. We change that. That's case A. Case B is just like this case except the sequence is different. You have conviction, SORNA takes effect, interstate travel, failure to register. Now, why would Congress have treated those two situations differently?",
  "Isn't the concern that the State of conviction knows that an individual who has been convicted of a sex offense has been released from custody and, if that person is a resident of the State, presumably knows that the person is likely to still be in the State, but if the person moves to another State, the State to which the person moves doesn't know that a sex offender has moved into the State, and that's the reason for the Federal law that imposes a penalty for failing to register in the new State after having traveled across interstate lines?",
  "Do you happen to know what Indiana law provided at the time? Within what period of time after moving to Indiana was the Respondent required to -- rather, the Petitioner required to register?",
  "Well, should the reasonable time -- should the period under SORNA, which isn't specified by statute, be the same as the period under the law of the State into which the person moves?",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "But all of those provisions refer now -- as a result of the Attorney General's determination that pre-SORNA convictions qualify, all of those provisions use the present tense to refer to activities that can have taken place in the past.",
  "This very -- this very statute. Isn't that correct?",
  "No, but your main argument is that \"travels\" is in the present tense, and that means present and future. But there are provisions of this very statute that use the present tense to refer to past conduct. So why doesn't that knock the legs out from under your textual argument?",
  "Well, Mr. Gannon may have made an argument that’s not helpful to his position, but you can accept that the first provision means exactly what it says: \"is required to register.\" And that takes effect on day when SORNA is enacted. There’s nothing in the statute that says that those three events have to take place in -- in a temporal sequence. It doesn't say \"is required to register and thereafter travels in interstate commerce.\" It doesn't say that. In fact, an earlier version did say that, and it was taken out, wasn't it?",
  "It doesn't if that results from the aim of the statute, rather than the order in which those elements are set out in the statute.",
  "Can I ask you this? Prong three of -- of Olano looks to prejudice, right? And then it's your position that prong four also looks to prejudice? Where you have two prejudice inquiries, one is more searching than the other, perhaps? How do they fit together in that relation -- in that regard?",
  "So under -- under three, the court could conclude that the defendant has shown that it isn't clear beyond a reasonable doubt, for a constitutional error, that the error didn't affect the outcome, so the defendant would clear prong three, but in prong four, a defendant might still lose if it's fairly clear, but not beyond a reasonable doubt that -- is that -- that how it would work?",
  "Does the --",
  "What if the -- what if the period -- the -- the period that was charged started 1 day before the statute took effect?",
  "Would -- would the test be different? Now, if you have 1 day of pre-enactment conduct, it's possible that the jury could convict based on that -- the evidence relating to that 1 day, isn't it? And so, therefore, if the test is any possibility, the result is automatic new trial in that situation. Is -- is that where your argument leads?",
  "Well, what if the conduct that -- we didn't have -- what if we did not have pre-enactment conduct? What if we -- if this statute applies only within the United States, as I assume that it does, and all of the conduct that's now pre-enactment was conduct that took place outside the United States? Would that -- would the case be different for these purposes?",
  "Instead of having pre-enactment conduct, you have conduct in Canada, Mexico, someplace else.",
  "No, of course, but the question is whether the mere possibility standard would apply in that case as well, or whether you think this mere possibility standard applies only in the case of pre-enactment conduct?",
  "Do you really think that if -- if there had been a much more lengthy voir dire and if the trial judge had been more willing to -- to grant motions to dismiss for cause, that it would have -- that it would not have been possible to find a fair and impartial jury in the district?",
  "Well, rule 21 says that the judge must grant a transfer if the judge is satisfied that a prejudice against -- that so great a prejudice against the defendant exists in the transferring district that the defendant cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial there.",
  "Well, doesn't that suggest that if you could find a fair and impartial jury with an adequate voir dire, then the transfer need not be granted?",
  "Were there any pre-McNally cases that involved a situation like this, where the benefit to the employee was in the form of the employee's disclosed compensation?",
  "Your argument is that you can infer waiver of the right to counsel from conduct, but you can't infer waiver of the right to remain silent from conduct?",
  "So, basically what you’re saying is that if the defendant here had said at the beginning, I don't know whether I -- I want to talk to you or not, but I'm going to listen to your questions and I might answer some and I might answer others -- that would be a different case?",
  "And where is there -- what Supreme Court case establishes the distinction between those two situations clearly?",
  "I'm not sure I really understand.",
  "I thought your answer was that there does not have to be a waiver before questioning can occur.",
  "There must be --",
  "So, what if the person says: I'm not waiving, but I'm not saying that I will never waive. I’ll listen to your questions.",
  "When he says --",
  "-- I'm not waiving?",
  "Can I interrupt? Before I can understand your case, I would like to understand this hypothetical. If the person says: I'm not waiving, but I'm not telling you that I won't waive at some point in the future. I’ll listen to your questions.",
  "That's a waiver.",
  "The facts here -- the facts here are quite extreme, but I am troubled by where you think the line should be drawn. If it is just mere negligence, would that be enough for equitable tolling?",
  "Well -- the difference between mere negligence and gross negligence -- one of the things I remember most clearly from torts in law school is that that's pretty -- that's an ephemeral distinction. But that's the one you one you think we should draw, between mere -- if it's gross negligence, then there's equitable tolling; if it's mere negligence, it's not?",
  "Could you just tell me in a sentence or two what test you think we should apply for equitable tolling? What is necessary in order for there to be equitable tolling?",
  "What does \"extraordinary circumstances\" mean?",
  "What if the lawyer lies to the client and the client says my time is running out, have you filed my -- my Federal habeas petition, and the lawyer says, yes, I filed it and here it is, and it has a -- a forged date stamp on it? No equitable tolling there?",
  "Isn't there at least one additional thing here? Holland filed a request -- a pro se request to be relieved of Collins's representation, and that was rejected by the -- that was rejected by the court because he was pro se. And therefore he couldn't ask -- he couldn't file something himself?",
  "Was that denied on the ground that he was pro se?",
  "What I don't understand is, how can a -- how can a client request to have -- to be relieved of representation, if the client can't file that motion pro se? I understand the other things, but I don't understand why -- how -- how you can deny the request to get rid of this lawyer? Unless he has to have the lawyer file the motion for him?",
  "What were the lies?",
  "What was -- give me an example of a lie that he told him?",
  "Doesn't that go without saying, that every attorney -- and every attorney presumably undertakes not to miss the statute of limitations? Is there a difference between the attorney who simply says nothing and the attorney who says, yes, I'm not going to miss the statute of limitations?",
  "That’s a lie?",
  "Well, I thought your --",
  "Maybe we should go back --",
  "Well, Mr. Clement, why shouldn't we go back completely to Justice Harlan's view about the way in which the Bill of Rights applies to the States?",
  "And your position is that a -- a State or local government could completely ban all firearms?",
  "Let me see if I understand your argument. I thought you said a minute ago that if a State or local government were to ban firearms completely, this Court might hold that that violates substantive due process because the right to use a firearm for self-defense is -- might be held to be implicit in the concept of ordered liberty; is that right?",
  "And -- but I thought you began by saying that the right to keep and bear arms is not implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.",
  "But if we took the approach that --",
  "If we took the approach that Justice Breyer outlined, would -- why would we not do the same thing with respect to all the applications of all of the amendments that up to this point have been regarded as being completely incorporated, along with all of our decisions? So why would we not look at all of our decisions under the First Amendment and the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment, and rank all of those interpretations on some scale of ordered liberty?",
  "Well, does it include the right to contract?",
  "Isn't that an unenumerated right?",
  "Are they paid less than other -- than other Federal employees who perform similar functions? And what do -- what do physicians who are not -- were not employees of the Public Health Service do about liability for Bivens actions? Are they responsible for getting their own malpractice insurance?",
  "If section 2679(b)(2), instead of saying paragraph (1) does not extend nor apply, had said the remedy against the United States provided by sections 1346(b), et cetera, and repeated that language from (b)(1), and then said: \"Is not the exclusive remedy in any civil action against an employee of the government,\" and continued with subsection (2), then the result here would be different, wouldn't it?",
  "How will a court determine whether an official was acting within the official scope of the official's responsibilities?",
  "What if the court can't tell by looking at the complaint? Is there going to be direct communication between the court and the foreign government on this issue?",
  "It's something of a -- it's something of a mystery that the FSIA doesn't say anything at all about this form of immunity; doesn't codify it, doesn't abrogate it, doesn't preserve the preexisting law. Do you have an explanation for that?",
  "But was this Act originally drafted by the Executive? Do you know?",
  "What is there to suggest that Congress was looking to domestic analogies? This has nothing -- immunity of officials under domestic law doesn't bear very much resemblance to the immunities that are available to foreign officials, does it?",
  "Well, do you agree with the Solicitor General's position about the preservation of the immunities that existed before?",
  "Yes.",
  "No, but whatever immunity existed previously for an official or former official was not abrogated by the FSIA. The FSIA just doesn't address that subject at all.",
  "There's no -- there was no immunity for someone who is the equivalent of a -- of a cabinet officer, previously?",
  "The minister of this or that in another government -- they have no official immunity?",
  "Do you think as a practical matter --",
  "-- there’s a -- I'm sorry. Do you think, as practical matter, there’s a difference between a $10 million judgment against a state for something that is official state policy in relation to defense, and a $10 million judgment against the current foreign -- defense minister of that state for exactly the same policy?",
  "But isn't it the case that before the 2005 amendments, bankruptcy courts were recognized as having discretion in calculating projected disposable income to take into account changes in the debtor's income after the filing of the plan, and shouldn't we presume that -- that Congress intended to continue essentially the same regime, unless Congress provided some clear indication that they wanted to depart from it?",
  "It is odd that Congress provided this very detailed formula and -- and that they would provide such a detailed formula and then say: But the bankruptcy court can modify that based on a projection. But still we have the word \"projection\" -­ \"projected.\" And your interpretation leads to very strange, really absurd results; isn't that true? And you have to devise some really elaborate escape strategies in order to allow a debtor to avoid those very strange results.",
  "But you say that that can be done only if the debtor fails to file a form that the debtor is required to file; isn't that right?",
  "What do you do with the situation in which the change that is projected to occur and in fact may be almost certain to occur is one that causes an increase in the debtor's income? Let's say the debtor was unemployed through almost all of the lookback period and then just before the filing of the plan gets a job with a good salary. You would say that the -- if you just look at the lookback period, the debtor would be required to pay practically nothing.",
  "What is a creditor to do in that situation?",
  "But can the -- can the plan be modified based on -- can the plan be modified based on something that was known before the plan was confirmed?",
  "Well, if it can't, then how is this modification remedy going to work?",
  "Your argument is that the Court has to confirm a plan that is really not confirmable because the debtor can't possibly make the payments under the plan, but then can turn around immediately and modify the plan so that it does call for payments to be made.",
  "Well, I thought that -­ explain it, then?",
  "What do you say about cases in which moving the 6-month period can't solve the problem? For example, if the debtor had good income for many years going back, but then slight -- shortly before the filing of the plan loses his or her job, and there is no prospect that the debtor is going to get another job? Or it could be the converse, has very low income for a long period and then right before gets a job. So you are not going to be able to cure those problems by moving the 6-month period. What do you do then?",
  "Can I ask you this. There seems to be at least a subtle difference between your position and the government's position. You say that the projected disposable income will be different from the disposable income calculated during the lookback period when it is known or virtually certain that there will be differences in income or expenses. And the government says that there is a difference when something is likely to occur in the future. Where do you -- where do you get from the statute your known or virtually certain differences?",
  "But do you think bankruptcy courts are supposed to be economic forecasters? For example, if you -- after calculating the debtor's income during the 6-month period, the 6-month lookback period, should the bankruptcy court said, well -- say: Well, it's -- inflation is projected to be such-and-such over the term of this plan, so I am just going to increase it by the amount of inflation; or: This person works in a particular industry where historically, over the last five years or ten years, there's been a 3 percent increase in salary per year, so I'm going to multiply it by -- multiply the disposable income figure like that?",
  "Well, why not? You say that the bankruptcy courts should take into account things that are likely to occur in the future.",
  "What if the debtor is a waiter and during the last month of the 6-month period, because of some change of the economy the waiter's tips have gone up either way up or way down? What's the court supposed to do then?",
  "Do you think it's -- it's correct -- in relation to Hibbs, is it accurate to say that you think that this case is different from Hibbs for essentially three reasons: That this one involves a complicated analysis of State law and Hibbs did not; that this one would potentially have a substantial financial effect on the State and in Hibbs that would not happen; and this case involves claims under the dormant Commerce Clause and equal protection rather than the Establishment Clause? Does that -- are those -­ does that capture it or is there something more?",
  "Well, suppose if this -- you have the dormant Commerce Clause claim and it doesn't require a complicated analysis of State law. You have different rates of taxation, let's say, for two different categories of entities, and it's really not a very important tax credit, so pulling the thread isn't going to have much effect. And this case -- then the case would come out differently? Comity would not bar that action?",
  "May I come back to your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question? Would it be beyond the ability of the Arizona courts, had that case been -- had Hibbs been brought in Arizona, to hold that under whatever principles of severability Arizona has, the tax credits for some private schools could not be stricken without striking the entire provision?",
  "The point is that -- that one possible -- if there was an Establishment Clause violation, one remedy would be to prohibit credits for payments made to religiously affiliated schools, but allow the credits for other private schools. But under principles of severability, couldn't an Arizona court say that can't be severed from -- from allowing the credits for payments to secular private schools?",
  "Doesn't that suggest Hibbs should have come out the other way?",
  "Well, in Hibbs, were all the beneficiaries of the provision that was challenged parties -­",
  "In Hibbs, were all of the beneficiaries of the provision that was challenged parties in that case?",
  "Was there a due process problem there because of that?",
  "Do you -- do you recognize that comity is broader than the Tax Injunction Act, and if it is, how do you justify your argument that would essentially limit the comity doctrine to the contours of the Tax Injunction Act?",
  "As far as the interests of your client are concerned, is there any functional difference between what happened here and what could happen very routinely even if the board had five members, namely that after the case was assigned to a three-member panel one of the three members of the panel became unable to sit on that case, but the remaining two members were able to reach agreement so the case could be decided?",
  "There is a well-established practice on the court of appeals that when a three-judge panel for some reason loses one of the members due to a death or resignation or recusal, the panel can continue to decide the case if the remaining two judges can agree. And -- and do you see -- do you think the -- the situation is different with the NLRB for some reason? Or do you think that that -- that those decisions on the courts of appeals are unlawful as well?",
  "I was surprised by your answer to -- I was surprised by your answer to one of the earlier questions, because one of your amici says that any member of the board, regardless of whether he or she sits on the panel hearing a case, may request that the case be heard by all five board members. Is that -- is that not correct?",
  "The amicus says that the members of the board not serving on a panel are given the opportunity to review draft decisions, thus no case will issue unless it reflects the majority opinion of the full board.",
  "So that can be, in effect, the opportunity for full board review before a draft decision is issued in final form; is that the way it works?",
  "But it provides an opportunity for them to vote to hear the case en banc before it's ever issued.",
  "It begs the question -­",
  "But hasn't the situation that has prevailed now for some time changed the -- the decision-making process of the board in at least two important ways? First, there isn't any opportunity for full board review of cases. But more important, if you have only two members on the board and only two members on the panel, the process is very different from a panel in which there were three members, or in which two members can be supplemented with an additional member if they can't agree. What are the two to do? They have to -­ they have to split the difference all the time. And there have been decisions in which the members have -­ basically have suggested that that's exactly what has happened.",
  "2244 doesn't make any reference to judgment, 2244(b). And now you bring in the concept of a judgment by looking at another provision. But if \"second or successive application\" means a second or successive application with respect to a particular judgment, then I don't see why the important and seemingly common sense point that you make in footnote 8 of your brief can be correct; namely, that when a prisoner such as Petitioner obtains habeas relief from his sentence but not his conviction, any habeas petition after his resentencing that challenged his conviction would be successive. You suggest that there are two judgments; there is a judgment of sentence and there is a judgment of conviction. But for habeas purposes, the only thing that is relevant is the judgment pursuant to which the Petitioner is held in custody. And that is the judgment -- that is the sentence. So I -- I -- if your argument is correct that you look to whether there's a second or successive application as to a judgment, then the point you make in footnote 8 just cannot be true. So that if Petitioner gets sentencing relief, gets resentenced, in the second petition the Petitioner can challenge the conviction.",
  "I understand that.",
  "Well, if a -- if someone has a -- a judgment of conviction, but is no longer in custody, that -- that person cannot bring habeas petition, isn't that right?",
  "So it -- it is the judgment pursuant to which the person then is held in custody to which the habeas petition goes.",
  "Well, I don't want to belabor -­",
  "I don't want to belabor this point, but once you get beyond the formal argument that you just look to whether it's a new judgment -- if you -- if you take a step beyond that, and if you -- if you don't take a step beyond that, then footnote 8 is wrong. If you take a step beyond that, then there -- then there isn't a textual basis for drawing this distinction between the sentence and the conviction. And what you need to ask is what is consistent with the scheme of that; isn't that right?",
  "Well, wouldn't your clients have an adequate remedy under Australian law in Australia, in the Australian court system?",

  "May I ask you another question about what happened? After the foreperson said: No, Judge, we are not going to reach a unanimous verdict, the judge says: All right, I hereby declare a mistrial; the jury is dismissed. And then the next entry in the transcript that we have is: Well, Mr. Gordon snuck away before we could set a new trial date. Now, Mr. Gordon was defense -- was the defense attorney?",
  "So when did he leave? Do we know when he left? He was present when the judge said that she was going to declare a mistrial?",
  "Well, certainly it's good practice. If both counsel agree that there is manifest necessity for a mistrial, then there isn't going to be a double jeopardy issue in the case, isn't that right?",
  "Why would it have been difficult? Why would it be difficult for counsel to say, may we have a sidebar, and say, Your Honor, I don't think that there should be a mistrial, I think you should ask the jury to deliberate further?",
  "That isn't what the judge said just before she got the response. She said: Are you going to reach a unanimous verdict or not?",
  "And the foreperson said: No, judge.",
  "The Michigan Supreme Court cited four factors in support of its decision: the length of the deliberations in relation to the complexity of the case, the heated discussions among the jurors, the fact most importantly that the foreperson said that the jury would not be able to reach a unanimous verdict, and the fact that there was no objection by defense counsel. Is there any decision in this Court that says that under -- that in a case in which those four factors are present, that the trial judge may not grant a mistrial?",
  "And is there -- could you give us a long list of -- of lower court cases holding that in a case where those four factors are present, a trial judge may not grant a mistrial?",
  "The question is when those four factors are present, why are they not sufficient to establish that the judge was exercising sound discretion? Unless there is a decision of this Court or perhaps a huge body of lower court case law, saying that, no, even when those four factors are present you may not grant a mistrial, how do you justify the conclusion that you are asking us to draw?",
  "Well, why is that -- why is that so? If Mr. Gordon thought that this jury was 11-to-1 for acquittal, do you think he would have been reluctant to ask for a sidebar and object to the granting of a mistrial?",
  "Are you really saying that? You're saying that a lawyer in your office defending a client who thinks that the jury is leaning, is 11-to-1 for acquittal, and the judge says, well, we're going to have a mistrial and the acquittal is going out the window, the lawyer is going to be reluctant to say: Judge, may we have a sidebar, and then go to the sidebar and object to the granting of a mistrial?",
  "Well, I'm not suggesting that they were or they weren't. I'm just asking about what defense counsel would do in that situation. Maybe they are more timid in Michigan than the ones I'm familiar with. I would think that they would not be hesitant to raise an objection if they thought it was going to prejudice the client.",
  "So are you suggesting that whenever the trial judge abuses his or her discretion in granting a mistrial, there can be relief under AEDPA? It is clearly established that whenever there is an abuse of discretion, relief can be granted under AEDPA. It is an unreasonable application of our precedent?",

  "You don't think it's a fair inference from the note that the jury was stuck?

  "You don't think there's an -- you can draw an inference fairly that they were -­ that there was substantial disagreement?",
  "But why isn't the term of imprisonment most reasonably understood to mean the term that is imposed viewed at the time when it is imposed? So that if someone is sentenced to a term of 360 days, 5 years, and begins serving his sentence on January 1st, year 1 of the term imposed ends on December 31st of that year; year 2 of the term imposed begins on January 1st of the following year, and so forth.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, hang on. I understand what you are arguing, but I don't understand why the term of imprisonment changes. We look at the -- we look at the term of the imprisonment on the day when it is imposed and the day when the defendant begins serving the sentence, and you can say: Year one ends at the end of 2010; year two ends at the end of 2011. Why do you think that the term -- the phrase \"term of imprisonment\" has to change as -- the understanding of the \"term of imprisonment\" has to change as the prisoner progresses in serving the sentence? I totally fail to understand that.",
  "But you don't know whether that -- you don't know whether that prisoner is going to be eligible for the 54 days until the 365 days are over.",
  "Well, I'm not sure where you get that -- I'm not sure where you get that out of the statute. But I still don't think you have answered my question. I don't want to belabor it too much. On the day when the prisoner in my hypothetical begins serving his sentence, if you said, When will your first year of imprisonment -- first year of your term of imprisonment end? You would say December 31st, 2010. When will the second year of the term of imprisonment end? December 31st, 2011. That's what you would have to say at that point, because you don't know whether the prisoner will earn any good time credits. So why do you think that the meaning of the year of the term of imprisonment changes as the sentence goes on?",
  "No, not at all. No. At the end of -- at the end of 2010, in my hypothetical, you would take the 54 days off the end, just as Justice Sotomayor suggested.",
  "And -- but it doesn't mean that the service doesn't -- your -- your argument is predicated on the idea that service of year two begins on the 311th day.",
  "But I don't understand that. I will not belabor it. I don't understand why the parties have spent so much time sparring over that issue, which seems to me to be totally unnecessary and irrelevant.",
  "Well, the statute says that it is -- the credit, it can be received, quote, at the end of each year of the prisoner's term of imprisonment beginning at the end of the first year of the term.",
  "Now, when does -- when is that point, in your opinion?",
  "Okay. So the -- day 365 is the end of the first year of -- of the term of imprisonment?",
  "The statute says that they -- that the prisoner may receive credit at the end of each year of the prisoner's term of imprisonment beginning at the end of the first year of the term.",
  "And what I'm asking is, when is the end of the first year of the term within the meaning of that language?",
  "Is it day 3 -­",
  "Is it day 365, or is it day 311?",
  "Well, I didn't understand them to be saying that. I understood them to be saying that the determination could be made at the end of 365 days, but if it's determined that the prisoner is entitled to 54 days of credit, then year 1 should be regarded as having begun on the 312th day, rather than the 366th day.",
  "Well, I think that they would say you won't know when the second year has begun until the full calendar year has been completed.",
  "Why is that even relevant? Why do you even get to that? Isn't the question what the parties understood the plea agreement to mean?",
  "But, well -- well, with respect, even if the Constitution permits this, if the parties understood the plea agreement to mean that this was going to be barred, then why isn't that the end of the matter?",
  "And I suppose the argument could be that the -- that the government has no authority under D.C. law to enter into such an agreement, as well require these two -­",
  "Can I ask you this: The District of Columbia Court of Appeals said we are satisfied that no objectively reasonable person could understand that Mr. Robertson's plea agreement bound Ms. Watson and precluded her contempt proceeding against Mr. Robertson. If we accept that, is there any other issue in this case?",
  "And did you preserve that? If -- if Mr. -- Mr. Robertson had said, I understand this only means that I am not going to be charged with a -- a criminal offense by the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, and it has no application to this civil contempt proceeding.",
  "But that's a separate question. So the first question is: What was agreed to under the plea agreement, right?",
  "Just so I understand what is before us, you preserve -- you saying -- you are saying you preserve the issue that even if your client fully understood that this plea agreement had no application to a criminal contempt proceeding, he preserved the argument that he could contest the criminal contempt proceeding on the ground that it would be unconstitutional?",
  "No, I understand that. I understand there's the contract issue. But did you -­ in the lower court, did you argue even if he gave that up, under the plea agreement, the criminal contempt proceeding still could not be brought?",
  "Even if he didn't get that -- a bar to that under the plea agreement, the contempt proceeding would still be barred for some other reason? Did you make that argument?",
  "Isn’t the --",
  "Isn’t the crux of your argument that for present purposes the term \"conviction\" must include a determination of recidivism?",
  "Well, what would you say --",
  "What do you say about 21 U.S.C. section 851, the Federal recidivism provision, which says: \"No person who stands convicted of an offense under this part shall be sentenced to increased punishment by reason of one or more prior convictions.\" So under that statute, the conviction does not include the recidivism determination.",
  "Isn’t that right?",
  "Could I ask you this question --",
  "If -- suppose a State makes simple possession a felony. Now, that doesn't make it a felony for these purposes, right?",
  "All right. But in sentencing the -- the defendant in State court for this felony, the -- the defendant concedes that he had a prior conviction, and the judge finds that and takes that into account in imposing the sentence. What would happen there?",
  "But what's missing there?",
  "What is the difference between that and -- and a situation where, just because of the vagary of State law, recidivism is something that has to be proven in order to bring the offense into the -- into the felony level?",
  "That seems to be a totally formalistic distinction that's based on the vagaries of State law. What -- what is the difference between someone who is found by a court under a State recidivism provision to have -- to be eligible for an increased punishment as a result of that finding and someone who is found by a court in the context of sentencing, discretionary sentencing, to have a felony possession, to have a prior -- a prior conviction and receives an increased sentence as a result of that?",
  "What is the -- is there any functional difference between those two situations?",
  "But does it matter in that situation that that's an element, that has to be an element of the offense?",
  "Could a -- could a defendant whose prior conviction was under a State recidivism statute claim that that conviction was invalid because that defendant was at that time deprived of the right of counsel? Do you see a difference between that situation and the situation in which -- and the situation in the sort of case we have here with respect to the issue of whether the prior conviction was invalid because of the deprivation of the right of counsel?",
  "Well, why are they distinguishable? You could -- you can -- you could -- a person faced with removal could challenge a prior conviction on the ground that there was a deprivation of the right of counsel, whether or not it was pursuant to a recidivism -- whether or not there was a recidivism issue in it, couldn't -- couldn't they?",
  "If someone wanted to send a message to one of these pagers, what sort of a device would you need? Do you need to have another pager, or can you -- could you send a message to one of these devices from some other type of device?",
  "Yes. What other type of device could you use to send a message to one of these pagers?",
  "Well, that's -- that's a little bit puzzling because there are -- electronic communications are stored all over the place in -- and there isn't a history -- these are -- these are relatively new. There isn't a well-established understanding about what is private and what isn't private. It's a little different from putting garbage out in front of your house, which has happened for a long time. If -- if statutes governing the privacy of that information don't have any bearing on reasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment, it's some -- I -- I'm at something of a loss to figure out how to determine whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding any of those things.",
  "What was the arrangement that Lieutenant Duke had in place? I thought all he said was: I don't have an intent to read these, because it's too much trouble, so if you go over and you pay me the extra, I'm not going to read them.",
  "Did he ever say that -- that I'm not -- that you have a privacy right in these things?",
  "Well, suppose it was perfectly clear that -- I mean, suppose that the department gave Mr. Quon a policy -- a statement that says: Sign this, you acknowledge that your pager is to be used only for work and that you have no privacy interest in it whatsoever; we’re going to monitor this every day. And then these other individuals sent him messages. You would still say they have an expectation of privacy in those messages?",
  "Can an officer who has one of these pagers delete messages from the pager --",
  "-- so that they can't be recovered by the department if the pager is turned into the department?",
  "They can delete them?",
  "Are you sure that -- are you sure about your answer to the question of deletion? It's not like deleting something from a computer which doesn't really delete it from the computer?",
  "Mr. McConnell, when I read -- when I read the papers that Hastings submitted to the district court at the same time that the joint stipulation was submitted, I saw one reference after another to an allegation that Hastings was applying its policy in a discriminatory manner, that it was not in fact insisting that all registered student organizations admit all applicants. And when I read their brief in the Ninth Circuit, I saw that point reiterated again and again. So that led me to believe that what was stipulated was not that in fact they had a policy which they enforced under which anybody who applied to any group would be admitted, but that this was what Dean Kane had announced. That was the stated policy, but not necessarily the actual policy that was employed. And that was the argument it seemed to me that CLS was making; isn't that correct?",
  "And was there any written document memorializing this policy prior to the time when the former dean gave her deposition?",
  "And is the -- is the policy as articulated by the dean in her deposition the same as the policy that Hastings now claims it has in its brief?",
  "Do you think this case deserved a two-sentence decision in the Ninth Circuit?",
  "So the answer is yes, this case which is -- before us has produced hundreds and hundreds of pages of amicus briefs, deserved two sentences in the court of appeals?",
  "But hasn't it been -- hasn't it been CLS's position from the very beginning of this case that Hastings has not in fact required every group to admit any student who applies? Don't they say that over and over again in their district court papers, in the court of appeals briefs, and in the cert petition?",
  "But you now say --",
  "You now say in your brief that it is okay for a group to impose membership requirements that are neutral and not based on beliefs. Isn't that right?",
  "Well, let’s explore --",
  "Let's explore the implications of this policy. Suppose at a particular campus there is a great deal of anti-Muslim animus. And there’s a small Muslim group; it has 10 students. If the group is required to accept anybody who applies for membership, and 50 students who hate Muslims show up and they want to take over that group, you say the First Amendment allows that?",
  "Well, CLS obviously thinks this is a real threat. Now, what do you propose that they do? Suppose that you win this case, and then when the case -- and then when this all-applicants policy is administered, then precisely what they fear begins to take place. Do they have any recourse?",
  "No, do they have any --",
  "Do they have any recourse?",
  "If they have 10 members, and 8 who are completely hostile to the organization sign up?",
  "I understand the answer to that question. So, if -- if hostile members take over CLS, the former members of CLS can form CLS II?",
  "If an orthodox --",
  "If an orthodox Jewish group or a Muslim group applied for recognition and the group said part of our beliefs is -- one of our beliefs is that men and women should sit separately at religious services, would Hastings deny registration to that group?",
  "We have -- we have two amicus briefs from orthodox Jewish groups and a brief from a Muslim group. So, your answer is that they could not be recognized under Hastings' policy because of their religious beliefs regarding the way religious services should be conducted?",
  "As I understood the position, your latest position in your brief, you really don't say you have an all-comers policy. There are certain criteria that can be applied, like interest, knowledge; is that correct?",
  "Could a -- well, could a group, consistent with your revised all-comers policy, require that members who want -- anyone who wants to become a member show a particular level of knowledge about the subject of the group?",
  "So if the CLS required anybody who wanted to become a member to pass a test on the Bible, that would be okay?",
  "If the school adopt an all-comers policy --",
  "-- for the purpose --",
  "Well, could I just ask one quick question relating to that? If -- if an all-comers policy is adopted for the purpose of discriminating on the basis of viewpoint, does it violate the First Amendment?",
  "If this were an employment case, and when an employee is denied promotion the employee said it's for reason A, and then after litigation begins the employer says, well, no, it really wasn't for reason A, it was for reason B because of a policy that we’ve long had, but there’s never -- there’s no written documentation of this new policy; and then at a later point in the litigation the employer says, well, it wasn't really either for reason A or reason B; it was for reason C -- do you think that summary judgment could be granted in favor of the employer on the issue of pretext?",
  "Well, section 66270 applies to programs conducted by a post-secondary educational institution, and your position is that if -- if a religious group complies with your policies and then it conducts religious services, those religious services are conducted by Hastings?",
  "Your position is that if the court puts off the order of restitution for 90 days, during that period, the defendant cannot take an appeal?",
  "Isn't that dramatically contrary to the way criminal appeals have been handled for a long time? There's a very short period of time for a defendant to file a notice of appeal in a criminal case, and you’re saying that that is dramatically extended by the possibility of -- of restitution later on or by the fact that the restitution order will be entered later?",
  "Yes, I understand that. But you’re saying the defendant is -- the defendant is incarcerated, let's say; is convicted, is sentenced to prison. The defendant wants to take a quick appeal. The defendant thinks he's going to win on appeal. And you’re saying, well, no, you have to wait 90 days before you can file your notice of appeal?",
  "How is your position -- how is your position consistent with the thrust of the victims’ rights legislation that Congress has enacted in recent years, including the statute that’s before us here? Now, in this case, the victim -- the victim's medical bills were paid by the United States. But that isn't always going to be the case, and sometimes victims are going to have a lot of lost income. So you have the victim, like the victim here, who is beaten to a pulp by a defendant and loses a substantial amount of future income as a result, and you say that if the judge makes a mistake, it's just too bad for the victim. The victim gets nothing because the judge waited too long.",
  "Do you think that’s what Congress had in mind?",
  "Yes, but wasn't -- wasn't the whole thrust of the victims' rights legislation that up to that point, Congress thought prosecutors were not sufficiently attending to the rights and the interests of victims? They were doing their own prosecutorial thing, but they weren't involving victims, making sure they knew about court proceedings, and so forth. And you’re saying, well, if the court makes a mistake and the prosecution falls down in its responsibility, the person who suffers is the victim who gets victimized again.",
  "Well, why isn't the --",
  "But isn't there a difference between those two situations? A fine is a criminal penalty. It goes -- it -- the prosecution is brought in the same of the sovereign. The fine goes to the sovereign. It's a traditional criminal penalty. Restitution is not a traditional criminal penalty. It's much like, arguably, attorneys' fees in a civil case. It is -- it is like -- it is really a -- a benefit for the victim. It is not something that inures to the benefit of the sovereign. And so why doesn't it make sense to view that judgment of restitution as a separate judgment, just as the award of an attorney’s fees is a separate final appealable order in a civil case?",
  "It can also include forfeiture. What’s -- what is the rule for forfeiture?",
  "What is the difference -- in response to the last argument that your opponent made, what is the difference between the provision here and Rule 32(b)(1) of the criminal rules, the court must impose sentence without unnecessary delay?",
  "So if the -- I didn't understand the answer. If the sentence is not imposed without unnecessary delay, the consequence is that there can be no sentence?",
  "Why does that even matter? I'm not really sure I'm following this argument. Let's say that the answer was filed during the limitations period, and the lawyer -- the plaintiff's lawyer is a solo practitioner, and he or she is out of the office because the lawyer's on a cruise --",
  "-- and doesn't come back for 2 weeks. And by that time, the limitations period has run. It's still a mistake.",
  "Well, where -- just -- where do you -- where in the rule is there anything that relates to the reasonableness of the mistake? What if it is the most foolish, negligent mistake you can possibly imagine? Is it not still a mistake?",
  "Well, that's evidence from which the absence of a mistake might be inferred. I agree with that, but that doesn't establish that it wasn't -- it wasn't a mistake.",
  "Mr. Garre, the Respondents argue that we should dismiss the writ here as improvidently granted, and I wonder if you could explain why that isn't the preferred course of conduct. They contend that when this was before the Ninth Circuit, your firm could have but did not contest the -- the vacatur of the APHIS deregulation order. It’s argued that an environmental impact statement is likely to be issued very soon, or fairly soon. Maybe the Solicitor General could give us an estimate. If we agree with your argument that the Ninth Circuit applied the wrong preliminary injunction standard and remand for them to apply the right preliminary injunction standard, the case may be moot by the time they do that. And the alternative is for us to plow into the extremely fact-bound question whether applying what you contend to be the correct preliminary injunction standard of relief would be warranted on this record. In light of all that, why shouldn't we take their suggestion?",
  "How do you answer Mr. Robbins’s --",
  "I'm sorry to interrupt. How do you answer Mr. Robbins's imminence argument?",
  "Well, Mr. Bopp, if a voter -- if the legislature passes a statute and someone is -- is satisfied with that statute, how likely is it that that person is going to sign a petition to have a referendum to see whether the statute should be blocked?",
  "It's possible --",
  "-- but if you were in the real world, if you were to poll the people who sign a referendum petition with respect to a statute that was passed by the State legislature, what percentage do you think would be opposed to that legislation?",
  "Well, to follow up on Justice Sotomayor's question, do you think an agency could say, if you want to comment on proposed -- on a proposed rule, you have to disclose to us your name and your address and your telephone number and your political affiliation, and all sorts of -- your marital status and your income level and all sorts of other demographic information?",
  "Could they do that?",
  "-- in the last questions --",
  "Well, I’d like to know how far you -- you are -- you want to go. You say in your brief that the availability of the referendum signature petitions allows Washington voters to engage in discussion of referred measures with persons whose acts secured the election and suspension of State law. So would -- would it be consistent with the First Amendment to require anybody who signs a petition to put down not just the person's name and address, but also telephone number, so that they could be engaged in a conversation about what they had done?",
  "I thought that you were saying that one of the interests that's served by this is to allow people who -- to allow Washington citizens to discuss this matter with those who signed the petition. So putting down the telephone number would assist them in doing that.",
  "So you would --",
  "You would endorse that? MR. McKENNA: That would be a policy determination for the legislature to make, Justice Alito.",
  "No, I'm not asking the policy question. I'm asking whether the First Amendment would permit that.",
  "Now, one of your Co-Respondents says that supplying this information provides insight whether support comes predominantly from members of particular political or religious organizations. Would it be consistent with the First Amendment to require anybody who signs a petition to list the person's religion?",
  "Well, let's say somebody is thinking of circulating a petition on a sensitive subject and fears that people may be dissuaded from signing because they fear retaliation. At what point could they bring this as-applied challenge? Do they have to -- could they do it before they even begin to circulate the petition, arguing that if -- if these names -- if people are not assured ahead of time that their name and address is not going to be revealed to the public on the Internet, they’re not going to sign this?",
  "And how would they --",
  "How would they prove that there’s -- that there’s a -- a threat, a sufficient threat of harassment in that particular case, before the petition is even signed?",
  "Well, the -- the hypothetical is that before this petition is circulated, the supporters came into court, and they said: Look what has happened in California with -- with Proposition 8. Don't disclose -- enter an order prohibiting the public disclosure of the names and addresses here. Would that be sufficient?",
  "Can I ask you this question? It seems to me your -- the strongest State interest here is detecting fraud. And you mentioned that the records are digitized. And maybe you can correct my impression of this, but it seems to me that if the records are digitized, there are very simple ways of detecting fraud that would not require the disclosure of the list to the public. If somebody wants to see whether his or her name has been fraudulently put on the list, wouldn't it be very simple to set up a Web site where the person could put in a little bit of identifying information and see whether that person's name is on the list? And if the -- the purpose is to see whether a particular person lives at a particular address, couldn't you just cross-reference by means of a computer program the information on the referendum with the -- with the voting lists? So if you've got John Jones who lives at 10 Main Street, you see whether there really is a registered voter John Jones who lives at 10 Main Street? Why does this all have to be put out on the Internet?",
  "Well, what's the answer to my question? Couldn't you -- couldn't this be done very simply? If I want to see whether somebody has fraudulently signed my name, very quickly go to a Web site, wouldn't be expensive to set up, put in your voter ID number, and see whether -- and your name, and see whether you’re on the -- on the --",
  "-- whether you -- somebody signed your name to the petition?",
  "Well, what is the -- to finish your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, what is the non-speech component of signing a petition?",
  "And what's the State's interest in regulating the non-speech component? When you -- when you talk about the vote cast by an elected representative, of course, there's a strong interest in knowing how an elected representative voted, because the representative is answerable to the voters. But somebody who signs a petition isn’t answerable to anybody -- any other citizen. So what’s your interest?",
  "It’s the fraud interest?",
  "Well, but how far does that go? When I asked whether you could -- you want to know the religion of the people who signed, no, you can't do that. How much more demographic information could be -- could be -- does the -- does the State of Washington have an interest in making publicly available about the people who support this election? Let's say it's -- it's a referendum about immigration. Does the State of Washington have an interest in providing information to somebody who says I want to know how many people with Hispanic names signed this, or how many people with Asian names signed this? Is that -- that what you want to facilitate?",
  "Then I don't understand what information is being -- what information you think you’re providing to the public. Outside of the fraud area, if I see that John Jones from Seattle signed this petition, that tells me absolutely nothing.",
  "You know, if somebody called your office and said I'd like the -- the home address of all the attorneys who work in the Attorney General’s Office because we want to -- we want to go to their homes and have uncomfortable conversations with them --",
  "-- which is what has been alleged here, would you release that information?",
  "Well, if the text of this is so clear, how is it that Mr. Gould and Mr. Abbott propose different interpretations of this provision?",
  "But they are not the same, are they?",
  "Isn't there -- isn't it -­ there is a missing prepositional phrase in this -- in the provision that we are looking at? It says, \"except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided.\" For what? And all of you have to -- are filling in the prepositional phrase. For an offense of conviction, for -- for an offense that's part of the --of the underlying transaction, for a violation of this particular provision or one that's very similar to it. There is just no way of getting around the fact that something has to be read in there. Something is implied; isn't that right?",
  "Where would we look to find the definition of a criminal transaction for these purposes?",
  "What if there were several 924(c) offenses committed during a rather brief period of time? What if on the same afternoon an individual engaged in a number of drug trafficking offenses and during each of those used or carried a firearm? Would they -- would they be part of the same criminal transaction?",
  "Well, you say \"different transactions,\" but I'm looking for the definition of a criminal transaction. The criminal law has labored with this for a long time. It's not a self-defining concept, is it, a criminal transaction?",
  "Well, it gives broader effect. It gives broader effect to the \"except\" clause, but the government's argument gives effect to the \"except\" clause, doesn't it?",
  "3559(c), which was enacted at the same time as this \"except\" clause, wasn't it, and makes explicit reference to -- to 924(c)?",
  "Yes.",
  "Whenever Congress uses a phrase like that, \"notwithstanding any other provision of law,\" does that mean that Congress must think that there is some provision of law that falls within that?",
  "Doesn't Congress commonly do that to make sure that something covers any existing statute there might be that would fall within that, without necessarily saying, well, there are two of them -- if there are two, maybe there are three? Going through the entire code to find out how many there might be, or if there is any?",
  "But it's not consistent with your main argument about the \"except\" clause, is it?",
  "No, but your argument is the \"except\" clause has to have some pretty substantial effect, or otherwise the \"any other provision of law\" part of it -- otherwise, they wouldn't have put it in.",
  "Why is that the crux of it? Congress made reference to the local standards, right?",
  "And were the -- was the commentary in the Collection Financial Standards in existence at the time when Congress enacted this provision?",
  "And that explains what the IRS understands the local standards to mean; isn't that right?",
  "Well, I understand that, but Congress decided to make reference to the local standards in this bankruptcy provision, didn't it?",
  "Yes.",
  "And this -- and at the time when it did that, there was official IRS commentary regarding the meaning of those standards, correct?",
  "And your argument is that Congress intended to adopt the standards promulgated by the IRS, but not the IRS's interpretation of the standards.",
  "Look at the local standard, which is on page 8 of the appendix to your brief, right? And all it says is \"Ownership Costs,\" \"First Car,\" \"$471.\" That's the relevant text, isn't it?",
  "What if a person leases a car? Do you think they get ownership costs?",
  "But they don't own the car, so how can they get ownership costs?",
  "Where do you get that, from the -­",
  "-- from the Collection Financial Standards?",
  "Where do you get the definition that somebody who leases something owns it?",
  "Then how do they get ownership costs?",
  "If somebody rents an apartment, do they own the apartment?",
  "What if you own a car, but it's completely inoperable and it has no value? You buy it for a dollar. It's a junk car, and you're planning possibly to restore it at some point. Do you get the deduction then?",
  "What if -- what if the definition of -­",
  "-- ownership costs was moved into the local standards themselves? Would the outcome be different then?",
  "No. It's moved from the CFS to the local standards, which are referred to in the -­ in the code provision.",
  "Do you think that the -- do you -­",
  "Do you think that the Bankruptcy Code provision freezes the -- the national and local standards to some degree or completely as they existed at the time when the statute was enacted?",
  "But the IRS can change -­ otherwise, they can -- going forward, they can completely change the national and local standards?",
  "In a situation like this, do you think it's meaningful to ask what the primary purpose of the victim was when he responded to the police and said who shot him? You have a man who has just been shot. He has a wound that's going to turn out to be fatal, and he's lying there on the ground bleeding profusely, and he says: My primary purpose in saying this is so that they can respond to an ongoing emergency. No, but I also have the purpose of giving them information that could be used at trial, but it's a little less -- that's a little bit less my purpose than responding to the ongoing emergency. It seems like it's totally artificial.",
  "If it were established that this was a dying declaration and was done in -- made in contemplation of death, would it be barred by Crawford?",
  "I understand -- I understand that, but assume -- assume for the sake of argument that it would be consistent with Crawford if it were a dying declaration, which the Court has suggested. What does that tell you about the understanding of the scope of the confrontation right at the time when the Sixth Amendment was adopted? Because a dying declaration may very well be testimonial under -- is likely to be testimonial under the Crawford test.",
  "Can there be -­",
  "Can there be a situation in which the primary purpose for a statement or for the question that elicits the statement is to respond to an ongoing emergency rather than to gather evidence for subsequent use in a legal proceeding when the statement relates to something that has occurred, perhaps just a few seconds before, but it relates to something that has occurred as opposed to something that is occurring at that very moment?",
  "Well, I understand, but we need to know where to draw the line. So, you concede that the line is not between a statement about he's hitting me with a baseball bat as opposed to he just finished hitting me with a baseball bat and is headed out the door? That's not where the line is drawn.",
  "No, no. I really would like a clear answer to this. Is -- can there be an ongoing emergency where the statement relates -- where the statement recounts something that has occurred, not something that is occurring?",
  "Well, suppose they get a 9-1-1 call. There's -- a man has just been shot on the corner of Fifth and Main. They go to Fifth and Main; they find a man there; he's shot; he's bleeding profusely; he's in shock; and they know nothing more about what's happened. And they say, well, what happened? Well, he shot me. Who shot you? It's John Jones. Now what about that?",
  "Well, the police under those circumstances don't know whether John Jones is going on a shooting spree; this is just the first of numerous victims. Maybe it's a gang fight. He's shot one member of an opposing gang; now he's going to go shoot another member of an opposing gang. How can they -- how can you answer that question, what's the primary purpose there? I just don't understand it.",
  "Well, I'm still trying to understand your conception of the scope of the ongoing emergency doctrine. Would it be fair to say that your idea is that the police have to have specific evidence that there is an immediate threat of physical violence that they want -- they need to respond to, in order for the ongoing emergency doctrine to apply?",
  "And in a case of doubt, they can't do it. So if they don't know whether there is an immediate threat or not an immediate threat, then that doesn't fall within that exception. That's your idea?",
  "I thought you just said that wasn't the test, past versus present. Didn't you say that about 10 minutes ago -- it's not the difference between something that's taking place and something that has taken place?",
  "The witness has to say there is an emergency?",
  "There's a shooting -­ there's a report of shooting at a school, and the police go and they find two students lying on the ground. One is dead, and the other is severely wounded. And they ask the one who is wounded: Who did it? It's John Jones. Now, does that -- is that an ongoing emergency.",
  "No?",
  "Well, why is that not an ongoing emergency? What would be an ongoing emergency?",
  "You have to have very specific information?",
  "What if there are three students who have been shot, four students who have been shot, but nobody says, well, I think he's still in the building, he may have an interest in shooting some more students?",
  "Of course that -- of course that's the emergency because how are they going to find the person that they -- that they're looking for if they don't know who it is? What if he's thrown away his gun? Of course, if they come upon him and he has his gun in his hand, then it's not a question. Bu what if he has disposed of it? They have to know who to -- who to go for.",
  "But I still -- I'm totally puzzled now as to what you -- when you think there's an ongoing emergency and when there isn't.",
  "It has to be made by the -­ by the declarant? It can't be inferred from the circumstances?",
  "Well, the Respondents here argue, don't they, that you should have created a procedure on your own, right?",
  "Now, if the -- presumably, that could be brought to the -- that could be brought before someone who is a County policymaker, couldn't it, when you are talking about something that's going -­ that's ongoing in the future?",
  "And then that would fall within Monell.",
  "So that's why I'm somewhat puzzled about what this case is about. When are we going to get into a situation in which the plaintiffs are asking for prospective relief and the matter cannot be brought before a municipal or County policymaker?",
  "Now, if that's the case, why wouldn't one of the following be possible? If you -- you say we have no discretion here. We are required to -- we are totally bound by the State procedures; we can't add any new procedure. They say, well, that's unconstitutional. So -- and you're choosing to do something that's unconstitutional because it's required by State law. Then, haven't -- in that situation, won't you have adopted a policy?",
  "It would be an Ex parte Young situation.",
  "Well, what would happen under California law if you said, we agree with the Respondents that additional procedures are constitutionally required. So, even though California law doesn't allow this, we are going to create these procedures because we have to comply with the Constitution. What would your situation be under California law? Would you be subject to -- what could the State do to you?",
  "I'm sorry -­",
  "Well, I have a question similar to Justice Sotomayor's. Suppose we were to hold that the Monell requirement applies to prospective relief, injunctive and declaratory relief. Can you provide an example of a -- an unacceptable consequence that would follow from -- from that holding, a situation in which that holding would -­ would, in your judgment, be one that we would not want to accept?",
  "What difference does it make?",
  "All right -­",
  "Now we have a situation. The clerk denies the marriage license. And then I presume you can take the matter before a municipal policymaker, and the municipal policymaker will say: This is our policy, license denied. Or this is not our policy. And then Monell is satisfied, right?",
  "If the policymaker says, it is our policy to deny licenses under this -- under these circumstances, that's a policy.",
  "I'm still waiting to hear -­ I'm still waiting to hear what cases it will screen out. I haven't heard an example of a case that it will screen out.",
  "But whether you were free to do it or not under California law, how can there not -­ how can it not be your policy that you have refused to provide these procedures which they say are constitutionally required? Your policy is to follow an arguably unconstitutional State requirement, rather than comply with what is arguably required by the Constitution. Why isn't that a policy? Now, all that's at stake is -- and, of course, it's a matter of practical importance, but all that's at stake is a monetary dispute between the State of California and the County of Los Angeles, which, as far as the federal Constitution is concerned, is the same thing as the State of California. So why should we be concerned about this at all? I don't understand why there's not a policy here.",
  "Yes, but all that's involved is money between -- between California and a creature of California. As far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, California could abolish the County of Los Angeles. California could subsidize you for your attorneys' fees, or they could levy some sort of -­ something upon you and require you to pay them additional money. None of that -- what's the constitutional concern in all of that?",
  "But do you think that the Federal court has to decide the issue of California law, namely whether you have freedom under this particular statute to add additional procedures to the California statute?",
  "Why isn't that something that ought to be decided in State court? Why isn't this a beef between the State and the State's creature, the County of Los Angeles?",
  "How can the Court determine that the right is not violated here without having some idea about either the existence or the contours of the right?",
  "Is it -- is it your argument that the Government can collect whatever information it wants from private individuals so long as the information is not publicly disseminated?",
  "What is the test -- what is the test for determining what sort of questions can be asked in the employment context? Is there any limit? Suppose the -- suppose the Government says, well, we want to know all about your diet; we want to know whether you smoke cigarettes; we want to know everything you read; we want to know what your hobbies are, what forms of entertainment you enjoy, sexual practices, every aspect of your private life, just because that gives us a better picture of who you are as an employee. Is that okay?",
  "Well, I had thought before the argument that one of the purposes for asking about treatment was to identify employees who may have undergone treatment on numerous occasions and dropped out of programs and been unsuccessful, so as to identify chronic drug abusers. But I guess in light of what you've just said, that this only reaches back 1 year, that is not a purpose of this -- this question.",
  "I don't see what the alternative, as a practical matter, is to asking this sort of open-ended question. The -- the alternative would seem to be to try to compile a list of every possible thing that the -- the person might do that would raise serious questions about suitability for employment or would be disqualifying for employment. And that seems to be impractical. There's almost no limit to the -- the sorts of things that might be relevant in that respect; isn't that right?",
  "Well, suppose the person who works at the -- at the gift shop or the snack bar -- I think that's what you mentioned -- has a big sign on his front lawn that says, \"I hope the space shuttle blows up.\" Is that information the Government has a legitimate reason to get?",
  "And now, what's the alternative to acquiring that information through an open-ended question? You have to have a specific question on the form: Does this individual have a big sign on his front lawn that says - -",
  "-- \"I hope the space shuttle blows up\"?",
  "Do you see what I am getting at? I don't see how you are going to do this, other than by asking an open-ended question.",
  "May I ask you this question about the question on drug treatment? Would it be unconstitutional for the Government to take the position that to require an employee or applicant for employment to disclose whether this individual had violated Federal or State drug laws and take the position that if the person gave an affirmative answer that was disqualifying, would that be unconstitutional?",
  "So they could -- they could say, have you bought, sold, used drugs in violation of Federal or State law? If so, you're disqualified, unless you can show that you have had treatment. And then it's up to you to disclose whether you've had treatment.",
  "What's really the difference between that regime and this -- and what you have here?",
  "How much of the information that's at issue here can be released and to whom?",
  "Can we just -- can we clear something up?",
  "Are you -- are you accepting the proposition that Brady always requires that lab reports be turned over?",
  "I know you concede that there was a Brady violation here - -",
  "-- but in answer to some of the questions, it seems to me you were possibly -- or at least you did not express an opinion on the suggestion that it is always a violation of Brady to fail to turn over a lab report.",
  "Yes, if you could -- could you just say as succinctly as possible what you would tell assistant district attorneys if you were the district attorney for this jurisdiction, and you, with the benefit of hindsight, having seen this case, what kind of -- what would you tell them they should do with respect to Brady?",
  "No, but you are training them, so: Now I want to tell you what you have to do under Brady.",
  "What do you tell them?",
  "I really would appreciate it if you'd get to my question. Brady requires that exculpatory evidence be turned over. Now, do you -- do you think the assistant prosecutors didn't even know that?",
  "Okay. Now, you phrase - - you are the instructor. You phrase the lesson that you think is required by Brady that has to be given to them.",
  "I mean, with respect, I really don't think, as a young district -- assistant district attorney, that you have told me anything that's going to be really helpful to me other than, you know, follow the law, which you certainly should do, in dealing with my obligation to turn over physical evidence, which is what's involved here.",
  "Or a lab report regarding physical evidence. Now, suppose I have -- I have several cases. I have this case, where I have got blood -- I have physical evidence, I have a blood test. I have another case where all I have was physical evidence, but there has been no testing of it. Now, do I have to turn over that physical evidence?",
  "I have to turn over all physical evidence that's in my possession?",
  "Okay.",
  "Now, what's the instruction that you're going to give me to tell me where I'm going to draw that line?",
  "Well, how do I know that before the - -",
  "How do I know that before the physical evidence is tested? Suppose I've got all sorts of items that were found at the -- at the scene, and they might have DNA on them. They might have epithelial samples on them -- you know, all this fancy forensic testing that's done these days. Do I have to turn over all of that?",
  "Now, you see what I'm getting at is that you're dealing with a very specific situation. So the instruction would be: If you have physical evidence and you have tested it for blood and you have a -- you have the result of the blood test, but you don't know whether -- you don't know the blood type of the accused, that -- that's Brady evidence, and that has to be turned over. And you're saying that the failure to provide training to every assistant district attorney on a question of that specificity gives rise to a -- a potential claim, gives rise to a claim?",
  "But the judge actually, though, instructed the jury -- this is back on J.A. 828 -- in order to find that the district attorney's failure to adequately train, monitor, or supervise amounted to -- deliberate indifference, et cetera. So liability could have been predicated not on the lack of adequate training, but the absence of a process by which superiors in the district attorney's office reviewed all of the Brady decisions that were made by more junior prosecutors; isn't that correct?",
  "Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't that be error? That the -- the head of a very large office is personally liable under Canton for violations that are -- that are produced by actions taken by subordinates, unless there is an elaborate process to review all of the decisions that are made by those subordinates? Doesn't that go well beyond anything Canton permits?",
  "Mr. Cooney, when you -- when you gave the specific instruction that you think should be provided to assistant district attorneys, what you stated was a questionable understanding of Brady, I think. You -- did I understand you correctly? You said that Brady means that if the prosecutor has physical evidence which, if tested, might establish the defendant's innocence, that is exculpatory evidence that must be turned over.",
  "Is that consistent with Arizona v. Youngblood?",
  "Well, if it was willful - -",
  "Is there anything to suggest that the Maryland legislature, in enacting that statute, intended to occupy the field of regulations of events that occur at funerals?",
  "Do you think that the epic is relevant as an explanation of some of these arguably ambiguous signs that were displayed at the funeral? For example, \"You're Going to Hell\"; \"God Hates You\" -- who is \"you\"? If you read the epic, perhaps that sheds light on who \"you\" is.",
  "Well, yes, but the signs say \"you,\" and the argument is made \"you\" doesn't mean Matthew Snyder; it means a larger group. And then you have the epic, which is directed directly at Matthew Snyder. Doesn't that show -- shed light on what \"you\" meant on those signs?",
  "Is this a situation in which all conduct that complies with the Maryland funeral protest statute is lawful? If the Maryland legislature said this is the -- these are the exclusive regulations that apply here, so that if someone came up to Mr. Phelps at the funeral and spat in his face, that would not be -- that wouldn't be illegal?",
  "Because it's not specifically prohibited by the statute?",
  "But is it - -",
  "Is it your -- is it your argument that the First Amendment never allows a claim for the intentional infliction of emotional distress based on speech unless the speech is such that it can be proven to be false or true?",
  "Is that your -- is that argument?",
  "All right. Well, Justice Kagan gave you one example. Let me give you another example along the same lines. Let's say there is a grandmother who has raised a son who was killed in Afghanistan or in Iraq by an IED. And she goes to visit her son's -- her grandson's grave, and she's waiting to take a bus back to her home. And while she's at the bus stop, someone approaches and speaks to her in the most vile terms about her son: He was killed by an IED; do you know what IEDs do? Let me describe it for you, and I am so happy that this happened; I only wish I were there; I only wish that I could have taken pictures of it. And on and on. Now, is that protected by the First Amendment? There's no false statement involved, and it's purely speech.",
  "Well, it's an older -- it's an elderly person. She's really probably not in -- in a position to punch this person in the nose.",
  "Well, if that - -",
  "Well, if that -- if that's a possibility there's a claim there, then what distinguishes that from this case? Now, I thought you were beginning to say that my hypothetical is different because Mr. Snyder made his son into a public figure, and the question I wanted to ask in that connection is whether every bereaved family member who provides information to a local newspaper for an obituary thereby makes the deceased person a public figure?",
  "But if the grandmother called up the local paper and said: Let me tell you something about my grandson - -",
  "-- who was just killed in Iraq. You know, he liked football and camping.",
  "That makes him -- that makes her a public figure?",
  "But your argument depends on the proposition that this is speech on a matter of public concern; is that correct?",
  "So let me -- let me give you this example. Suppose someone believes that African-Americans are inferior, they are inherently inferior, and they are really a bad influence on this country. And so a person comes up to an African-American and starts berating that person with racial hatred. Now, is that -- this is just any old person on -- any old African-American on the street. That's a matter of public concern?",
  "Why aren't the members of the family - -",
  "Why aren't the members of the family of the deceased a captive audience at the funeral?",
  "Well, I thought the targeted picketing of a person's house is not protected by the First Amendment.",
  "What's the difference between that and picketing around the site of the funeral?",
  "So it doesn't have to do with whether this is a -- what you characterize as a public funeral as opposed to a private funeral? That's not the distinction you are relying on any longer?",
  "And what if a parent is called after the -- he puts in the obituary information and called by the local newspaper and asked for a comment, and he says or she says, I'm proud of my son because he died in the service of our country? Does that -- is he stepping into a public debate by doing that?",
  "Section 22(b)(1) refers to side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings. If the term \"unavoidable\" was intended to carry its ordinary meaning, what need was there for the rest of that language: \"Even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings\"? If it was improperly prepared or didn't have the proper directions and warnings, then the side effects are avoidable. So that language is surplus, isn't it, if \"unavoidable\" really means unavoidable?",
  "But isn't it true that at the time, there was a distinct minority view that you could not recover for design defects for vaccines?",
  "What would happen if a drug manufacturer sought FDA approval of an alternative vaccine and the injury occurred during the period while that was under consideration by the FDA? That's -­ that's just too bad?",
  "May I ask you this question about something that Mr. Horwich said? Under your understanding of this scheme, if a -- a person suffered a very serious injury as a result of the Sabin vaccine during the period when the CDC recommended that over the Salk vaccine, would the -- would that injured person have a claim for design defect if the person could -­ could produce experts who said the CDC was wrong, that they should never have made this recommendation?",
  "Well, this may be -- this may be what Congress wanted and may be the better policy, but your answer to my question is that -­",
  "-- that would permit a lay jury relying on experts produced in court, the CDC got this wrong, the Salk vaccine was really the better one.",
  "If you looked back at a sample of the cases in which they have simply said \"denied,\" would we find cases in which no procedural bar was raised by the State?",
  "But you didn't raise -- you haven't argued that it's procedurally barred.",
  "So you may have waived that. On the other hand, your opponent has, as I gather, until they got here, never argued that it was based on anything other than the merits. So they might have waived that.",
  "So everything might be waived here.",
  "Unless the -- sorry.",
  "Was there additional physical evidence found not at the scene?",
  "Could I ask you a question about California procedure? Is what happened here unusual? Is there -­ doesn't -- does the prosecution have an obligation to provide notice before trial of its intention to call expert witnesses?",
  "And if the defendant requests that, does -- what's the defendant's reciprocal obligation, if any?",
  "And what is your theory about why he -- why Johnson would have a motive to go through this exertion? He's -- he's wounded. And let's say there really was a gun -- a gun fight, and Klein fell someplace else. Johnson wants to make it seem like Klein was -- that there wasn't any gun fight. Why -- why is it so valuable to him to move Klein's body from the location where you think he fell to the couch?",
  "But he could have -- if he's going to make up a story, he could have made up the story that Klein jumped up and he was shot without having engaged in any firing himself, and he fell wherever he fell. Putting him on the couch doesn't seem to -- unless I'm missing something and I wish you'd explain it -- doesn't seem to aid this purportedly false story very much. And if you weigh whatever benefit there is from that against the exertion of moving this guy, it doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense. But maybe there's something there that's not apparent.",
  "Well, he had not received notice from the State that they were going to call any experts, so why wasn't it reasonable for him to assume they're not going to call any experts, they're not going to be able to pull experts out of their pocket in the midst of the trial, and the judge isn't going to allow them to do that without providing a -- without granting a recess? What seems to have happened here seems pretty unusual.",
  "But under your example, isn't there a majority for the proposition that there's a procedural default, but disagreement as to the particular procedural default?",
  "If it's just a binary choice between procedural default and merits, isn't there -­ and everybody agrees it should be denied, then there's going to be a majority for one or the other, right?",
  "Is there more than one possible procedural problem here?",
  "I thought it was just timeliness.",
  "What does your office do in this situation, all right, a client is indicted in Federal court and you anticipate that there are all sorts of motions that you might make if this case is going to trial, but at an early point the prosecution offers you what looks like a really good plea bargain. Now do you litigate all those motions? If you have, you know, you have a chance of winning, of suppressing some statements that your client made, suppressing physical evidence, getting certain evidence excluded with a motion in limine, maybe you could win on a severance motion, do you think you litigate all those rather than grabbing a good plea deal when it's offered to you?",
  "So if you take the deal, then you want it later to be open to the Defendant if he's not, you know, after the Defendant has spent some time in jail, he's not too happy with the deal any more, he can now come back and say, well, the Federal public defender's office was ineffective because they could have moved to suppress my confession and the illegal search, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, that is all open for relitigation years later?",
  "No?",
  "Even without his testimony, isn't there a very strong case of kidnapping? Let's just take it step-by-step. What would have been the defense to the kidnapping charge?",
  "He didn't -- that he didn't go to the -- to the victim's RV with the other men? That would have been the defense?",
  "Excuse me. Where was the citation for this?",
  "Could I just clarify something? Is it your position that the prosecutor, in making his offer of proof at the plea on 227 to 228, affirmatively said that this was an accident or did not -- did not allege that it was intentional?",
  "Where is that? I -­",
  "You read that as a -- as a claim that there was no intent to kill?",
  "I have to say, I think that's a very aggressive reading of what was said here. It was not necessary for the plea to this offense to prove an intent to kill, and the statement that the intent that was necessary, which is lesser intent but sufficient to support this plea, was present is not a statement that a greater mens rea was absent. And I thought you argued to us that the prosecutor said this was not intentional. It was an accident.",
  "Let me give you this example. Suppose a company has an established policy that if you want to make a complaint, there's a particular supervisor you should go to. And let's say they say you can make this complaint in writing, you can make it orally. Now, there's -- something's going on in the workplace and the supervisor happens to be walking by, maybe a machine is broken, an employee has been hurt, and an employee walks up to the supervisor who is walking briskly by, taps the supervisor on the shoulder and says the company is violating the Fair Labor Standards Act because of the placement of a clock. You said that filing has no formality requirement. Would that be the filing of a complaint?",
  "It's one thing to say that filing doesn't necessarily mean that something is written, although that's usually what the word means, isn't it?",
  "Are you filing your comments right now?",
  "You are? Really?",
  "That's the ordinary usage of the word. But to say that it includes no degree of formality, that's your argument?",
  "If that's the law and the employee gets fired and the employee says, well, this was done in retaliation for my having filed an FSLA complaint three weeks ago, and the employer says what complaint? We have no record of any such complaint and the employee says, oh, yes, I said it orally to a supervisor who was passing by and my buddy Joe was there and he's going to corroborate this. So now we have a trial about whether a complaint was filed?",
  "With whom?",
  "It would really be helpful if you could just give us the rule that you think should apply. Is the rule -- your -- your -- Mr. Kaster's argument seems to be anything goes, any oral communication to a supervisor goes.",
  "Let me go back to the example I started out with. A worker has been hurt, a supervisor is going to attend to the hurt worker, and an employee says, the company is violating the FLSA. And the supervisor says, don't tell me, and don't tell me about it now. I'm doing something else. That's enough?",
  "In the real world, a prisoner who wants access to DNA evidence is interested in overturning his conviction.",
  "Do you deny that?",
  "And isn't the emergence of the Rooker-Feldman argument in this case an illustration of the absurdities that pursuing the 1983 path produces? Because habeas is not subject to claim preclusion, is it?",
  "It's not subject to Rooker-Feldman?",
  "But since you've squeezed this into 1983, now have you to deal with both of those issues.",
  "Well, aren't -- aren't the -- the exculpatory nature of the evidence and its materiality elements of the Brady claim itself?",
  "Well, this gets to what troubles me about this case. Although the Sixth Circuit referred to summary judgment in its opinion, it seems to me the Sixth Circuit actually reviewed the evidence at trial and determined that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the evidence at trial. So I don't know why this case actually presents the question on which cert was granted. It seems to me it presents a question of -- a purely factual question in the end, whether there was -­ whether judgment as a matter of law was appropriate. And you never raised the judgment as a matter of law. You never raised in the court of appeals, as I understand it, the argument that the defendants' ability to object to the entry of judgment as a matter of law was waived because they never filed a Rule 50(b) motion. Isn't that right?",
  "Well, suppose we were to hold that they -- that they couldn't review the denial of summary judgment. The case is remanded to them, and they say: Okay, well, we made a slip of the pen when we referred to summary judgment in the prior decision. We really were saying that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and, although there wasn't a Rule 50(b) motion, that was waived because it wasn't raised on appeal. So we are -- we come back to exactly where we are now. All we've done is to correct a slip of the -- what was arguably a slip of the pen, perhaps motivated by their belief that the Rule 50(b) issue is jurisdictional. But it really is not under our cases distinguishing between jurisdictional questions and claims processing questions.",
  "Well, Mr. Mills, I got you started on this, but this -- none of this is the question on which we granted review, is it?",
  "We didn't grant review to decide whether a court of appeals can consider judgment of a -- judgment as a matter of law where there isn't a 50(b) motion and no argument is made that the -- that issue was waived by failing to make the motion. We didn't grant review on that.",
  "And your argument is that where a --the district court denies summary judgment on a qualified immunity issue that is based even purely on an issue of law, there can't be a review unless that's renewed -- there can't be appellate review unless that purely legal question is renewed in a Rule 50(b) motion. That's your -- that's your argument?",
  "But what if the facts are utterly undisputed? There's a videotape of exactly what went on. Nobody has the slightest disagreement about the facts. The only question is whether the right was clearly established, and the district court rejects that at summary judgment. What benefit -- what is the point of saying that the defendants have to raise that same issue again in a Rule 50(b) motion? It's utterly a -- a pointless exercise.",
  "The -- what's -- determining what is a mixed question is notoriously difficult. What about the -- the situation where the -- the ruling is, assuming certain facts to be true, the -- the right was not clearly established? Now, is the fact that certain facts are assumed to be true enough to make that a mixed question?",
  "Mr. Mizer, is it your understanding that -- that Unitherm was based on Seventh Amendment considerations, or was it based on prior decisions that in turn were grounded on considerations of fairness to the verdict-winner, namely the opportunity, when a -- a motion for judgment as a matter of law is made after the verdict, to move for dismissal without prejudice or move for a new trial?",
  "I mean, the answer is it's a -- it's a pointless gotcha rule. That's -- that's -­ isn't that the answer? It's a pure issue of law, and the district court has already said: I ruled on this on summary judgment; don't bother me with this again. And we're going to say, well, you still have to raise it in a 50(b) motion? What -- that'd be -- that's -- that there's no point. We might as well say that the lawyer has to stand on his head when the motion is made or jump up and down three times.",
  "Isn't it argued that a possible purpose of that was to make it clear that the Federal Government couldn't sue a State to recover money that had been given to it?",
  "You addressed the -- the effect of the issue here on persons who are in State institutions other than penal institutions. What would be -- what's the effect of the issue here on land use restrictions? Are there many cases in which issues involving land use restrictions are -- are raised in litigation against the State as opposed to a municipality?",
  "Suppose Congress passes a statute that creates a private right of action against both the Federal Government and against the States and in both instances authorizes all appropriate relief. Are damages available in the action against the Federal Government as well as the State government?",
  "Well, the State -- the State provision is a Spending Clause provision.",
  "And what about the Federal Government?",
  "What sense does it make? Other than -- I know you are representing a client and so special pleading for your client is -- is to be expected, but I find that very difficult to accept. If \"all appropriate relief\" includes damages as against the State that accepts Federal money, then you know, what's good for the State should be good for the Federal Government.",
  "Before you do that, Barnes and Franklin were cases involving implied rights of action; isn't that right?",
  "Okay.",

  "How can they -- how can they do that? Isn't the average person likely to think that what's appropriate for a 17-year-old may not be appropriate for a 10-year-old or an 8-year-old?",
  "Well, I think what Justice Scalia wants to know is what James Madison thought about video games.",
  "Did he enjoy them?",
  "Do you think there's any barrier in California to minors' access to sexual material?",
  "Does your office spend a lot of time enforcing that?",
  "But what if -- what if a State passes a -- what if California took the list of video games that your association rates as mature and said there's a civil penalty? And you apparently don't want your -- you don't want vendors selling those games to minors; isn't that right?",
  "You don't want that. And, now, what if California said there's a civil penalty attached to that?",
  "You seem to argue that -­ that there really is no good reason to think that exposure to video games is -- is bad for minors, exposure to really violent video games is bad to minors; is that right?",
  "So why -­",
  "But we have here a new -- a new medium that cannot possibly have been envisioned at the time when the First Amendment was ratified. It is totally different from -- it's one thing to read a description of -- as one of these -- one of these video games is promoted as saying, \"What's black and white and red all over? Perhaps the answer could include disposing of your enemies in a meat grinder.\" Now, reading that is one thing. Seeing it as graphically portrayed -­",
  "-- and doing it is still a third thing. So this presents a question that could not have been specifically contemplated at the time when the First Amendment was adopted. And to say, well, because nobody was -- because descriptions in a book of violence were not considered a category of speech that was appropriate for limitation at the time when the First Amendment was violated is entirely artificial.",
  "Let me be clear about exactly what your argument is. Your argument is that there is nothing that a State can do to limit minors' access to the most violent, sadistic, graphic video game that can be developed. That's your argument?",
  "Is it or isn't it?",
  "And you say there's no problem because 16-year-olds in California never have $50 available to go buy a video game and because they never have TVs in their room, and their parents are always home watching what they -- they do with their video games, and the parents -- and the video games have features that allow parents to block access, to block the playing of violent video games, which can't be overcome by a computer-savvy California 16-year-old; that's why there's no problem, right?",
  "Well, before we jump to agency law, shouldn't we take a look at the language of the statute?",
  "And the statute says that a prima facie case is made out if it is shown that military service, anti-military animus, was a motivating factor in the employer's action. The employer's action here was discharge, right?",
  "And the word \"motivate\" means to provide someone with a motive to do something, right?",
  "And the person who did something here was the person who discharged, discharged Mr. Staub, right?",
  "So why doesn't it follow that the motivation that's relevant under the statute is the motivation of the person who -- who performs the action that is challenged?",
  "No, but the -- what is -­ what is made illegal are certain employer actions, right? Not everything that's done, not -- just writing up a bad report for a biased reason is not actionable under this statute; isn't that correct?",
  "Could I just ask where -­ could I ask where your argument leads? Let's say that an employer calls in an employee and says: Now, we have to decide who to lay off, and we've looked at your record over the last 10 years, and here it is, all the evaluations you've gotten over the past 10 years, and based on all of that, we -- we've decided that you're going to be the person to be laid off. Now, if it turns out that one of those evaluations was rendered by someone who had an anti-military bias, would that make the employee -­ would that be a prima facie case against the employer?",
  "Even if the -­",
  "Even if the employer at that time did every -- made every reasonable effort to investigate the validity of all the prior evaluations, still the employer would be on the hook?",
  "That isn't what the statute says. You -- you jump over the language of the statute. It has to be a motivating factor in the decision to discharge. And that speaks -- that looks natural -- the natural reading of that is that it looks at the motivation of the person who actually makes the decision to discharge. Now, I'm not suggesting that's the right rule. That's a very unattractive rule. But the rule that you have suggested is also a very unattractive rule, one that I doubt the Congress intended to adopt. Is there no reasonable middle position here? It's all or nothing?",
  "What happens in the situation where a prior evaluation or some disciplinary action does have a substantial effect on the decision that's -- the employment decision that's made, but the employer has no notice that the prior evaluation or disciplinary action was based on a biased ground, or any reasonable way of finding out that it was based on a biased ground? What happens in that situation?",
  "How do you get around the statutory language that says that the motivating -- it has to be a motivating factor in the -- in the action that is challenged?",
  "And the employer's action here is -- is discharge.",
  "Yes, but those other people -- everybody who has been delegated authority under the -- by the employer are not -- is not involved in the action that is challenged.",
  "Does not take the action that is challenged.",
  "So maybe then the test is whether they were delegated some of the responsibility for the challenged action. Were they delegated responsibility for making the discharge decision?",
  "Well, do you think that the standard for employer liability is different under this statute than under other Federal antidiscrimination statutes? Is that what you're - you were just suggesting?",
  "So that if we -- if we hold here that -­",
  "If we were to hold here that the \"cat's paw\" theory doesn't apply under this statute, the Seventh Circuit and other circuits could continue to apply the \"cat's paw\" theory under Title VII or under the ADEA or under the ADA?",
  "Mr. Jay -- I'm sorry.",
  "Isn't it true that for a period of 10 years the lower courts uniformly held that there wasn't any preemption here? And if that's the case, why didn't the Federal Government come forward at any point during that time and say that this is preempted?",
  "If the child were injured by a Type 2 belt, would a suit based on that be preempted?",
  "Yes.",
  "If we adopt your view, would Geier apply to any other regulation?",
  "By 1989, hadn't the agency decided that the child safety concerns were no longer applicable?",
  "Would you say the same thing about a tax deduction?",
  "That it's the government's money?",
  "Because they were kind enough to give me a tax deduction -­",
  "Because they are kind enough to give the taxpayer a deduction for certain contributions?",
  "But why isn't that true of a tax deduction also? And this is a very modest tax credit. The tax deduction that a wealthy person would get by making a contribution to a college or university that has a religious affiliation is much more valuable than this $500 credit.",
  "I completely don't understand that. Somebody does know. It's December 31st. They know -- they figure out how much tax they're going to have to pay for that year. They know exactly. They can know exactly what their taxes will be. And it will be X, and if they make a -- a deduction, then it will be X minus Y. What is the difference?",
  "What difference does it make what they say on their Web sites? There's a very important philosophical point here. You think that all the money belongs to the government -­",
  "-- except to the extent that it deigns to allow private people to keep some of it.",
  "It doesn't take it by taxes.",
  "That's what your whole argument is based on.",
  "So if Arizona had a statute that gave an income tax deduction only to individuals who make charitable contributions to educational institutions, there would be a problem there, because they -- it wasn't a general tax exception for charitable contributions?",
  "I thought your answer to Justice Ginsberg was the difference between this and the Federal tax deduction for charitable contributions was that the Federal tax deduction is available for a broad range of charities, whereas this is available only for a very narrow range.",
  "And that would be true if even if the -- if the top marginal rate was 90 percent?",
  "But the Federal rate has been that high -­",

  "If you -- you have STOs that say we will only give -- we will only give scholarships for religious affiliated schools, but we will not discriminate on the basis of the student's religion.",
  "And if this is the government's money, you think that would be -- that would not be an Establishment Clause violation?",
  "What do you say \"made\" means?",
  "See, I'm with you, and I think you -- the text supports you up to the point where you add the qualification. But once you've added that qualification, I think you're -- you're outside the text, just as Costco is outside the text with the qualification that they had.",
  "How often does this situation -­",
  "How often do issues involving 602(a)(1) come up with respect to things like books, musical recordings, movies, as opposed to the copyrighted -- the -- the -- the material that is copyrighted here, a little -- a little insignia, a place to a label -- put on a label or put on a -- on goods?",
  "Well, what is your answer to the argument that if \"lawfully made under this title\" means basically made in the United States, that provides a great incentive to manufacture goods abroad and that can't possibly be what Congress intended?",
  "Why do you accept the word \"incident\"? Incident is not in the statute.",
  "Well, why isn't the answer that the -- that the noneducational aspect of the service has to be incidental to what they're doing?",
  "If the question is whether someone is predominantly a student or an employee, why shouldn't we ask: Why are they enrolled in this program, and why is the institution enrolling them in the program? Why are residents enrolled in the program? Are they enrolled in the program to make money, or are they enrolled in the program either because it's a licensing hurdle they have to clear or they want additional education, and why is the institution hiring them? Is the institution hiring them to get the value of their services or is it hiring them for educational purposes?",
  "Well, in general, though. In general, why are residents -- why do medical school graduates become residents? Do they do -- are they doing that because they want to earn the 40 to $50,000 a year that they're paid, or are they doing it for some other reason?",
  "What if they -- on average they were paid $10,000 a year? Would it be the same?",
  "But I thought clinical work could qualify as a course. Is that wrong?",
  "We now have a lot of briefs -- we now have a lot of briefs filed in this Court by -- in which a lot of the work is done by students in law school. I assume they're getting credit for that. Is that -- is that not a course?",
  "But is it a course? Is it not a course?",
  "I understand that. I'm -­ I'm questioning why you're resisting the proposition that clinical work can constitute a course.",
  "What happens to the -­",
  "But isn't it the California rule that a hearing had to have been conducted unless they concluded that the petitioner was not entitled to relief based on the facts alleged in the petition?",
  "Well, to get back to the question the Chief Justice asked before, trial counsel did consult a psychiatrist, Dr. Stalberg, and his report was very unfavorable. Now, it's your -- it's your argument that it was ineffective for them not to continue their search for a helpful expert and come upon Drs. Vinogradov and Olson or someone like them during that period of time? Is that -- is that the claim?",
  "Well, suppose a petitioner in the State post-conviction proceeding proffers an affidavit from one mental health expert alleging one type of mental disorder, and then after relief is denied in the State court, the petitioner files in Federal court and asks for an evidentiary hearing at which the petitioner is going to call a dozen highly distinguished mental health experts who will testify to a very different mental disorder. Now, has the petitioner developed the factual predicate for that claim in the State proceeding?",
  "Well, that's very complicated, just as your opponent's idea of what constitutes a claim is very complicated and fact-dependent. What -- would it not be better to say that the petitioner in the example that I gave did not -- was not diligent in developing all of the additional evidence that could have been brought forward at the State proceeding, assuming that it could have been, but was not brought forward until the Federal proceeding?",
  "The factual predicate of the claim is the new evidence that's brought forward in -­ in the Federal proceeding, and unless there is a good reason why that wasn't brought forward in the State proceeding, it shouldn't be considered.",
  "I thought that -- I don't want to interrupt your complete answer.",
  "But I thought that was the gist of your argument, the heart of your argument, that traditional unconscionability in California and elsewhere focuses on unfairness to the party who is before the tribunal. So here it would be unfairness to the Concepcions, rather than unfairness to other members of the class who are not before the court.",
  "Well, maybe you can explain it this way. Compare what the Concepcions have available to them under the contract with what going through the arbitration, all the procedures leading up to arbitration and arbitration, against what they would get at best if this were allowed to proceed on a class basis.",
  "Why is -- why are they better off with a -- with a class adjudication?",
  "And -- and isn't that what distinguishes this from the ordinary unconscionability analysis? If the district court correctly understood the way the AT&T Mobility scheme works and --and the district court said that under the revised arbitration provision nearly all consumers who purchase the informal -- who pursue, I'm sorry, the informal claims process, are very likely to be compensated promptly and in full, etcetera, etcetera. If the district court understood that correctly, the scheme here was -- is found to be unconscionable because it doesn't allow the enlistment of basically private attorneys general to enforce -- to enforce the law. And isn't that quite different from ordinary unconscionability analysis?",
  "Can I take you back to a question that was asked a few minutes ago, because I'm not sure I understood your answer. What is the difference between a State rule that says that the rules of civil procedure must be followed in any adjudication and a rule that says that class adjudication must always be available?",
  "Yes, uh-huh.",
  "No, I just -- I'm not putting this under an unconscionability label. These are just general rules, and the question is whether they -- whether they can be applied, whether they constitute discrimination against -- against arbitration.",
  "Why?",
  "No, but I really would appreciate it if you would answer my hypothetical on one that was posed before. What is the difference -- let me change it slightly -- between a rule that says you must follow the rules of evidence in every adjudication and a rule that says that class adjudication must always be available? I think your answer comes down to the proposition that the former is inconsistent with the idea of arbitration, and therefore, that's why it's not allowed, and the latter is not inconsistent with the idea of arbitration, and therefore, it is allowed. Is that correct or not?",
  "Well, okay. It amounts to the same thing. Insisting on compliance with the Federal -- with the California rules of evidence is an obstacle to arbitration, but allowing -- insisting on the availability of class adjudication is not an obstacle to arbitration. But in the end -­",
  "-- we have to make a value judgment about whether these things, one thing or the other, fits with arbitration. That's what it comes down to.",
  "And when it -- when it imposes the rule that the -- the rules of evidence apply across the board, it says it feels that these are necessary in order for parties to be treated fairly in every method of adjudication.",
  "Do you think we have to decide whether the appropriate comparison class is the rail carriers' competitors or some broader class?",
  "Well, you are arguing in favor of -- you are arguing in favor of a very idiosyncratic interpretation of the concept of a discriminatory tax, aren't you? In almost any other context, granting tax exemptions to one group but denying them to another group would be viewed as -- if there isn't a good reason for drawing the distinction, as discrimination, wouldn't it?",
  "And it did so with explicit language by -- in -- what is it -- (a)(4), by referring to property that is subject to a property tax levy.",
  "So what you're saying is that the ordinary interpretation of the concept of a discriminatory tax should not be applied here, because Congress used specific language to take tax exemptions out of the determination of discrimination under other provisions.",
  "What sense does that make?",
  "What sense does that make? The fact that they specifically took it out of some provisions but not out of this provision, you think, leads to the implication that they meant to put it in here, too, where they could have easily used language here to put it in.",
  "So it's a commodity that is purchased by only railroads and one other class, and there is a 4 percent sales tax on this commodity, but the other class is exempt from the tax. Now, is that -­ is that discrimination against the railroad?",
  "Let's say there is some commodity that is purchased only by railroads and truckers, and there is a 4 percent tax on the commodity, but truckers are exempt from it -- from the tax. Is that discrimination against the railroad, even though it takes the form of -- it's not discrimination against the railroad because it takes the form of a tax exemption?",
  "Once you say that, your argument that exemptions can't count as discrimination is destroyed, because you are conceding that an exemption can constitute discrimination.",
  "Wasn't that said in relation to the principle that only -- that where paternity was not established, the child would be regarded as having the citizenship of the mother under the law of virtually every country, if not every country, at that time?",
  "Until there is legitimation, it goes through the mother. It went through the mother under the law in virtually every country, right?",
  "There is another argument that you could make, other than the one you've been pressing, which is that collateral review means something other than a step in the criminal case. But you've chosen not to make that; is that correct?",
  "What about a motion -­",
  "Am I correct that you think \"post-conviction or other collateral review\" means anything that occurs after the conclusion of direct review?",
  "Then what does the phrase \"or other collateral review\" add? Why -- why wouldn't Congress just say \"post-conviction review\"?",
  "Can I return to the question Justice Ginsburg asked a couple of minutes ago? We have -- let's say we have a case in which a defendant convicted in State court has some exhausted Federal claims that this defendant wants to raise in a Federal habeas; also files a motion seeking a reduction of sentence based purely on a request for leniency, a sentence within the range prescribed by the statute. What purpose is served by tolling the time to file the Federal habeas during the pendency of this request for leniency in the State court? Now, you say comity, but in concrete practical terms, what purpose is served?",
  "In your experience, does that happen a lot? You have somebody who is sentenced to a 5-year sentence and that's within the range, also has legal challenges that would result in no conviction, no time whatsoever and no criminal conviction -- that person decides to give up on the legal challenge because the 5-year sentence might be reduced to 3 or 2 or 1?",
  "What would happen if the statutory maximum for an offense in Rhode Island is 5 years and the sentencing judge imposes a sentence of 10 years, and the defense attorney at that time says, well, you can't do that, that's more than a statutory maximum; and the judge goes ahead with it, and then an appeal is taken? You're saying that the appellate court in Rhode Island would not entertain that argument? They would say you have to go back and make a Rule 35 motion in the trial court? Maybe that's the procedure.",
  "It seems odd. Is that it?",
  "Could I return you to something more basic? Do you think the term \"collateral review\" is a legal term of art, or is it a term that we can -- we should interpret simply by looking up the word \"collateral\" in a dictionary?",
  "Isn't -- if I look up \"collateral attack\" in Black's Law Dictionary, won't I find a definition there? And won't it tell me that this is something other than the proceeding? This is an attack on a judgment outside of the proceeding that led to the entry of that judgment. Isn't that what the term generally means?",
  "Right.",
  "But it's part of the case.",
  "Well, what about just a regular motion for a new trial, not based on newly -- on newly discovered evidence? Is that collateral, or is -­ is that part of the -- the criminal proceeding?",
  "Well, what's wrong with the argument that nothing that occurs in the criminal case itself is collateral? What Congress had in mind when it spoke about collateral review was something like habeas. Let me give you an alternative interpretation of this, and maybe it's completely wrong, but you'll tell me why it's wrong. \"Post-conviction\" is a term of art. Many States, including Rhode Island, have postconviction review statutes. So Congress wanted to have that time, the time when those proceedings were tolled -- were pending tolled. But not every State uses that phrase. Not every State uses that term. They have other names for the proceeding, and that's what's meant by \"other collateral review.\" \"Collateral review\" is a term of art. It's not something that you understand by looking up the word \"collateral\" in a dictionary. What's wrong with that?",
  "I'm not saying it has to do with whether it's legal or something else. It has to do with whether it's in the criminal case or not in the criminal case.",
  "2255 is -- is in the original case, but it's a habeas substitute. It was adopted by Congress as a substitute for habeas; isn't that right?",
  "What if it's filed within 6 months and it's -- it's rejected as untimely, and the petitioner wants to try to demonstrate that this represents a grave departure from the way these are normally handled by the California Supreme Court? Is there any way for the petitioner to do that?",
  "Well, I -- I'm not -- I don't understand your answer, then. You have -- let me just adapt what Justice Sotomayor said. You have -- a case, a Supreme Court case is decided. And you have 10 -- 10 habeas petitioners in California who file on exactly the same day. And five of them, if you were to get to the merits of their claim under this new decision of this Court, five of them would be entitled to relief, five of them would not be entitled to relief on the merits. And the California Supreme Court holds that the five who would be entitled to relief are procedurally barred and the five who were not entitled to relief on the merits are not, and they are rejected on the merits. Now, would that be an adequate State ground?",
  "No, I know -­",
  "-- and I'm not suggesting that it would. But if it were to happen, would that be adequate?",
  "So fair notice is not the only requirement.",
  "Isn't your argument that the California timeliness rule was never an adequate rule, never can proceed, never can bar consideration of a Federal claim?",
  "What if Mr. Walker had waited 20 years; would it still be inadequate as to him?",
  "How many -­",
  "How may of these petitions are filed each year in the California Supreme Court?",
  "Approximately what?",
  "With that many petitions, is there any possibility that a multifactor test such as the one that California is applying could be applied with any degree of regularity, unless there's some sort of secret internal guidelines that are being applied by the California Supreme Court in deciding this?",
  "Mr. Phillips -­",
  "Yes.",
  "All this talk about what the receiver may think can be done seems a little bit perplexing to me, because the receiver did not testify before the three-judge court; isn't that correct?",
  "You were not allowed to question him.",
  "And now he has submitted what is styled an amicus brief where he doesn't address issues of law. He explains his views about -- he tries to explain prior statements and supplement those prior statements. Is that proper?",
  "Well, is that true? Can -­",
  "Can a witness testify -- can a witness submit an amicus brief that consists of an affidavit?",
  "Can you explain what the connection is between the 137.5 percent figure and the constitutional violations relating to the provision of medical care in general and treatment for -- for mental illness? My understanding of the 137.5 percent figure is that that has to do with the total number of prisoners in the -- in the system in relation to design capacity; isn't that right?",
  "Now, what does the ruling -­ that doesn't speak to the number of personnel who are available in the system to attend to medical needs or mental illness. It doesn't speak to the extent of the facilities that are available for those purposes. It seems to be -- there seems to be a disconnect between those two. Could you explain why that is narrowly tailored?",
  "See, that's what I don't understand. You can have a -- could you not have a prison where the cells are somewhat crowded -- and 137.5 percent of design capacity is not -­",
  "-- is not unconstitutional in itself, is it?",
  "You could have -­",
  "Or you could have a prison where the -- the cells themselves are crowded, and yet there are other facilities available for medical care and plenty of staff to attend to those things. So what's the connection?",
  "But why order the release of around 40,000 prisoners, many of whom, perhaps the great majority of whom, are not going to be within a class in either of these lawsuits? Why order the release of all those people, rather than ordering the provision of the construction of facilities for medical care, facilities to treat mental illness, hiring of staff to treat mental illness? Why not go directly to the problem rather than address what seems to be a different issue altogether?",
  "If all they do is to build more cells, they're not going to address the problem. So I -­",

  "That's a very indirect way of addressing the problem, and it has collateral consequences. If -- if I were a citizen of California, I would be concerned about the release of 40,000 prisoners. And I don't care what you term it, a prison release order or whatever the -­",

You don't -- that's not going to happen in California?",
  "Isn't it true that one of the main programs that they were -- that was cited as providing a safeguard is evidence-based rehabilitation programs?",

  "They -- they don't have to be released if you can build enough cells -­",
  "The 17 percent figure -- and the 17 percent figure goes to exactly my concern. This is going to have -- it seems likely this is going to have an effect on public safety. And the experts can testify to whatever they want, but you know what? If this order goes into effect, we will see.",
  "We will see, and the people of California will see: Are there more crimes or are there not?",
  "If the -- if the SPD is part of the plan, then where does the \"likely harm\" standard come from?",
  "No, but why is there any requirement whatsoever, other than the fact that it's in the plan? If the SPD is the plan and the SPD says you get certain benefits that you wouldn't get under the written document, then -- the previously executed written document, then you get the benefits under the SPD, period. It doesn't matter whether there's likely harm or reliance or anything else, right?",
  "Could I ask you this: If this were an individual action and it -- and it were under (a)(3), what would either the plaintiff or the defendant have to show, depending on what the burden -­ who has the burden, on the issue of likely harm? What would \"likely harm\" mean in that context? The person was likely to have left the employment of the company, or what? What else?",
  "If an administrator -- if an administrator issues a summary plan description that is 100 pages long and is basically the same thing as the written instrument, and that's a violation of the requirement in ERISA that it be a summary and that it be intelligible to ordinary readers, what remedy is available to a beneficiary?",
  "Well, doesn't that put the -- think of the incentives for the administrator in that situation or for the plan sponsor. If you issue a succinct SPD, you risk misleading the recipients as to the contents of the plan, and you may have financial liability. If, on the other hand, you issue -- you err on the side of issuing an SPD that is comprehensive, well, the worst that can happen, according to what you just said, is you can be faced with an injunction to provide a more concise and comprehensible statement.",
  "If this is a contract case, then where does the \"likely harm\" standard come from? If I'm owed something under a contract, I'm entitled to get that under the contract. I don't need to show that I was likely harmed by, that I relied in any -- in any way on anything.",
  "Do you think likely harm is required?",
  "Well, there was a -- there was notice, wasn't there?",
  "And is the claim based on that, or is it based on the SPD?",
  "Could I ask you this? The D.C. Circuit's decision in Crooker has been the leading decision in this -- on this issue for nearly 30 years, and there has been a great deal of reliance on it, certainly by the lower courts in general, and perhaps also by Congress and by the executive branch. Do you think there's anything to be said for deference to that decision based on the fact that it has been -- there has been reliance on it to such a great degree for such a period of time?",
  "I ask -- I ask the question because the world has changed in a lot of ways since 1981, and one is that there is now, I think, much greater concern about the disclosure of information that has perhaps profound security implications. That was not as much of a concern in -- in 1981. If you think about, for example, suppose there's a Federal building with a hallway that is accessible only to somebody who has a code key. Would that be -- is that -- does that have to be disclosed under FOIA? Or architectural plans for a Federal building that would disclose the size of the bomb that would be necessary to bring the building down or bring part of the building down; is there any FOIA exemption that covers things like that?",

  "Do these flights of prisoners from one facility to another come to a stop when -- you know, when the whistle blows on Saturday -­ on Friday afternoon?",
  "Suppose the petition here had simply raised one question, and that is the question of how you count time under -- under a version of Rule 45 of the Federal Rules Of Criminal Procedure that is not -- no longer in effect and as to which there is no conflict in the circuits. How would you grade the chances of the Court taking cert on that?",
  "If I could just come back to where you started before you go on to these additional points. Your argument is that if the Government petitions for cert on one issue that's a legal issue on which there's a conflict in the circuits and the Respondent in a criminal case says that the -- asks to have the decision below affirmed on 15 other grounds, we -- and raises those in the bio, we take the case anyway, we are duty-bound to decide every one of those 15 grounds?",
  "Congress thought about the Speedy Trial Act when it made those technical amendments, isn't it likely to have thought the courts had interpreted it as excluding the weekends up to that point?",
  "Didn't think about -- okay.",
  "Well, why aren't they trying -- why isn't the effect of what you're doing to prompt us to dismiss this case that the petitioner has improvidently granted? If we were to write an opinion that says that the -- the Sixth Circuit was wrong in its interpretation of subsection (f), and therefore, we're not going to get to -- and anything we then had to say about subsection (d) is just dictum, and that's the issue that we took the case to decide, why should we keep the case at all?",
  "How do you reconcile your argument with the situation in which the motion is pending for 30 days, so that's the period from the filing until the prompt disposition, and as a result of that motion, the trial judge says this has caused -­ this is going to force me, this is going to result in 10 days' delay in the date on which the case can begin, so the trial date is pushed back 10 days? Now, in that situation, how much time is excluded?",
  "So given the choice between a dismissal and an affirmance with good dictum about subsection (d), you would prefer the latter?",
  "You quote one definition of -- the noun \"base\" in your brief uses a point from which something can develop, but you omit another standard definition of the term, the principal element or -- or ingredient of anything, considered as its fundamental part. Why do you do that?",
  "Well, there's two -- there are two different definitions. One is something that provides a starting point for analysis. The other is the fundamental thing on which something is -- it rests.",
  "Now, if you use the latter definition, you have to decide which is more fundamental here, the agreement between the parties or the sentencing guidelines, which certainly provided the starting point for the analysis of the sentence by the -- by the district court.",
  "Well, wouldn't the guidelines, even in that situation, provide the starting point for analysis? Isn't the district court obligated, and isn't the -- doesn't the presentence report have to go through the guidelines calculation before the sentence is imposed? So you start out with the -- the guideline sentence of whatever the figure was that you mentioned, and then you go from there, and maybe you depart downward.",
  "So why wouldn't that be based on the guidelines? Just because there's such a big downward departure?",
  "Well, in every case, they have to go through the guidelines calculation, and the parties have the opportunity to object to the calculation, right?",
  "So what does paragraph 12 of the plea agreement contribute here, other than with respect to the fine and things besides the sentence that we're talking about? It doesn't seem to me to add anything substantively.",
  "What if there had been evidence here of that? What if the government in connection with this plea agreement had dropped counts or had decided not to seek a superseding indictment adding counts? Would -- would the situation be the same?",
  "How would that possibly work? Let's say the government drops count -- agrees to a plea on count 1 with a guideline range of 60 to 65 months; drops count 2, which would have increased the guideline range to, let's say, 100 to 105 months; and says this is our deal, you know, you agree to -- to 65 months and we're going to drop count 2. All right?",
  "And then the guideline for that is lowered, and you say in determining whether the defendant is eligible, what -- the government would then have to have a mini-trial and prove that the -- prove count 2?",
  "How would it work?",
  "Right.",
  "Right. MR. HEFT -- guideline range would be reduced, and then, as the judge said in this case said, if you have objections, let me know; file your objections. That's where the government could file -­",
  "Yes. The government files its objections and says, well, we dropped count 2. And the defendant says, well, I wasn't guilty of count 2.",
  "How is the judge going to decide that?",
  "Why doesn't this line of questioning lead logically to the conclusion that no sentence after Booker and Fanfan is based on the guidelines? Because, today, a sentencing judge can engage in the same analysis that the Sentencing Commission may engage in when it decides that a guideline range should be lowered and that that should be retroactive. The judge can do that at the time when the sentence is imposed. We roll the clock back on the crack -- on the crack cocaine guidelines. Under the authority that judges now have under Booker and Fanfan, a judge could say, well, I see that this is the crack cocaine guideline right now, but I think it is too harsh for all the reasons that were later persuasive in lowering the range, and therefore, I am sentencing below the range. So it seems to lead logically to the conclusion that 3582 is yet another provision of the Sentencing Reform Act that was tied to the old pre-Booker mandatory sentencing regime, and now that that is out the window with Booker and Fanfan, the whole -- the whole mechanism is -- is superfluous.",
  "Well, I find it hard to -- I find it hard to understand the analysis that would require courts to decide whether some (c)(1)(C) plea agreements are based on the guidelines and some are not based on the guidelines. Maybe they are all based on the guidelines, and then the obligation would be on the government to put a provision in a standard plea agreement requiring the defendant to give up the opportunity to move for a sentence reduction if the guideline range is subsequently lowered. Or maybe none of them are based on the guidelines because -- for the reasons I just mentioned: This whole mechanism is now needed no longer as a result of Booker and Fanfan.",
  "But your position is that even willful blindness is not enough. You have to have actual knowledge that -- that the item is patented, right?",
  "So if the attorney had called up your client and said, I have an answer for you, and the client said, well, you know what, on second thought, I really don't want to know, because if I -- if I have actual knowledge, that may put me in a box; so forget about it. Then there's no liability.",
  "When I look at the language of the statute, I see no scienter requirement whatsoever. Whoever actively induces infringement of the patent -- infringement is strict liability. So if you actively induce somebody to engage in conduct constituting infringement, you're -- you're liable as an inducer.",
  "You have intent, but intent to do what?",
  "What difference does that make? Because making, using, and selling equals infringement.",
  "Well, I don't see that. And not only that, I don't understand why the scienter requirement for inducing should be higher than the scienter requirement for a direct infringement. Isn't the standard rule for aiding and abetting that the aider and abetter -- if (b) is an aiding and abetting provision, as one of the congressional reports said, the -- the scienter for aiding and abetting is the scienter of the underlying offense? So if the underlying offense is a strict liability offense, then the inducement should be strict liability as well.",
  "If this is not willful blindness, I don't know what willful blindness is. Now, maybe you can explain what more would have been required to permit a reasonable jury to find willful blindness.",
  "But your client -- I don't know whether you're using your time most effectively by arguing this point, but your client thought that making a deep fryer that wouldn't burn people's hands if they touched it would be profitable, because there wasn't a lot of competition in that market. This was a useful product and apparently one that was different from other deep fryers. Isn't that in itself -- doesn't that in itself suggest, gee, there might be a patent on -- on this?",
  "One company is making this and it seems to be better than what the other companies are making; maybe it might be patented.",
  "Mr. Cruz, while we are certainly interested in what the standard should be. But in terms of the deposition of this case, maybe you could help me with this. The -- the instruction to which there was an objection on, 124A to -- well, wherever it is in the joint appendix -- was the newer should have known, right?",
  "And the objection that I see was that the words \"or should have known that their actions\" -- this is 135A of the joint appendix -- should have been stricken. So am I right that the only issue that was preserved is the question whether actual knowledge was required? Because that was the only -­ that was what -- that was the error, the alleged error that was identified by Mr. Dunnegan.",
  "So if he is wrong on that, then the judgment should be affirmed.",
  "So you want actual knowledge of the patent? That is your test?",
  "Do you want actual knowledge of the patent?",
  "And that is the issue you preserved with your objection?",
  "What have universities been doing for the last 30 years? Have they been proceeding on the assumption that title to inventions vested in them automatically or have they been very careful about getting assignments from all of their employees?",
  "There are two things that cut very strongly against your argument. I mean, there are many things that cut in favor of it, but the two things that seem to me to cut pretty strongly against your argument are: First, that it has long been the rule that inventors have title to their patents initially, even if they make those inventions while working for somebody else. And the second is that you are relying on a provision that says that the nonprofit organization may elect to retain title, which means hold onto a title, that the -- the organization already has. There's just no accepted definition of the word \"retain\" that corresponds to the meaning that you want to assign to that word. \"Retain\" does not mean obtain.",
  "Isn't it the case that at least some components, possibly many components, of the Federal Government for the last 30 years have been proceeding on that assumption that assignments were necessary? The grants here were -- were from NIH, isn't that right?",
  "And one of the amicus briefs points out that the NIH compliance guidelines say by law an inventor has initial ownership of invention; however, awardee organizations are required by the Bayh-Dole Act to have in place employee -- employee agreements requiring an inventor to assign or give ownership of an invention to the organization -­",
  "Well, isn't there a -­",
  "Isn't there a big difference between the statute and the prior vesting statutes? The prior vesting statutes said if the government pays for the research, then the taxpayers ought to get the benefit of the patent. But this statute says if the taxpayers pay for the research, if the research is 100 percent funded by the taxpayers, taxpayers don't get the first priority. The first priority goes to the universities. So it's totally different from the vesting statute. This is a Federal subsidy for universities and other nonprofits, isn't it?",
  "If we agree with you, how should a judge instruct a jury to determine whether a substance is crack? Should the judge use the definition in the sentencing guidelines?",

  "It has to have all three of those characteristics?",
  "But I thought you just said that freebase would qualify, and freebase would not have the second of those characteristics; isn't that right? It was -- it would not be prepared using a base?",
  "So if it had any base?",
  "Other than crack and free base, are there other forms of cocaine base that are actually in use in any substantial amounts in this country by drug users?",
  "Are there actually people in the United States who are smoking coca, coca paste? I thought that that was exclusive to South America.",
  "Are you aware of cases where that's happened?",
  "To go back to your definition of crack, just so I'm clear on it, if a substance -- in the second prong of your definition, if a substance is tested and chemically it is pure C17H21NO4, no trace of sodium bicarbonate, no trace of ammonium, is it possible for a defendant to be convicted and given the crack penalty?",
  "That's right. And I don't think -- could you just reiterate what the second prong of your test is because I thought -- I was under the impression it required the presence of a reactant.",
  "So you need extrinsic evidence about how this particular substance was prepared in order to satisfy it? If you don't have the trace elements of the reactant, you need evidence that that's how this was made?",
  "What if it's pulverized? I don't know whether that's possible, but could you grind it up so that it's not rock-like anymore, so it's like a powder -­",
  "-- and smoke it after it's in that form?",
  "No, but you could have -- in Romanette (iii), they could have said 50 grams or more of a mixture or substance which contains cocaine base, period. There was no need to have it described in clause 2 if there's nothing implied in Romanette (ii) that is not also in Romanette (iii) with respect to cocaine. On your submission, it's just bad draftsmanship?",
  "What about optical and geometric isomers of cocaine? Those -- those fall under Romanette (ii), Roman (II), but not under (iii). Are there such things?",
  "Well, my understanding of how coke -- how the paste is produced is the following: You start with the leaves; then people vigorously macerate the leaves by stomping on them for an hour or more; and then this mixture is -- this -- what's left is mixed with an alkaline material such as sodium bicarbonate, an organic solvent, such as kerosene, and water; and what you end up with is a gummy, yellowish solid called coca paste; is that -- that's correct?",
  "Yes. Now, if a chemist analyzed that or then analyzed crack or freebase, wouldn't there be present in the coca paste lots of other substances that would not be present, in quantities? Other substances would be present in quantities in the coca paste that would not be present in the crack or the freebase?",
  "So a DEA chemist could test -- could test a substance and say this is coca paste of the type that is smoked in South America by some people. This is crack or freebase that has been mixed with water into a pasty substance -- a chemist could make that -­ that differentiation, couldn't they?",
  "Mr. Camreta would be protected. He would presumably still be entitled to qualified immunity because a vacated alternative holding certainly could not really establish something, I would assume. But municipalities, if they continue to participate in -- in questioning of this nature, would not be protected; isn't that right?",
  "But you want to have the Fourth Amendment decision preserved and have it govern an enormous chunk of the country so that all the States in the Ninth Circuit have to comply with it, and anybody -- any individual officer who doesn't comply with it would do so on pain of personal liability, but you don't want that ground-breaking decision to be subject to review by this Court on the merits. Is that a summary of what you want? Does that make any sense?",
  "What is there in the Ninth Circuit's opinion, which -- which generally requires a warrant, to suggest that the length of the interrogation was relevant to their decision? I mean, at least the child protective services need to decide whether they need a warrant before they begin the questioning, no matter how long it's going to last. Where does it say that the length is relevant to the -- to the issue that they decided?",
  "On the issue -­",

  "If you were designing what you would regard as an ideal system, and you're very knowledgeable in this -- in this area, and you concluded that some kind of approval by a detached individual should be required before something like this is allowed, would you set the standard at probable cause?

So that, suppose the Department of Labor issued what everybody would concede is a report and appended to that certain documents, wouldn't those documents be in the report, even though they are not the report themselves?",
  "Well, could we talk about the test that you propose? You say that a report is a usually formal account of the results of an investigation given by a group or person authorized to make it, right?",
  "And then an investigation is most reasonably understood as an official probe into fraudulent conduct.",
  "So if the report does not investigate fraudulent conduct, then it isn't -- if something does not involve information about fraudulent conduct, it's not a report?",
  "Well, could I ask you about a document to which your adversary referred? The Department of Justice and all of the other departments are required annually to issue what are termed Freedom of Information Act reports. Now, is that a report -­",
  "-- under the False Claims Act?",
  "But this report is -­ doesn't seem to involve a process that's any less mechanical than responding to a FOIA report. It's basically a compilation of statistics: how many requests were filed, how long it took to process them, exemptions that were claimed, and so forth. So what's the difference?",
  "Well, I -- I understood the definition that I read to be the position that you are advocating, not simply some dictionary -- some definition that happens to appear in the dictionary. I understood that to be the test that you were saying we should adopt. Am I wrong? Did I misread your brief?",
  "But if we adopt your definition, isn't it true that a lot of things that are labeled Department of Labor report, Justice Department Freedom of Information Act report, are not reports?",
  "So you're withdrawing from the definition that you proposed in your brief?",
  "Well, may I ask you why a FOIA response doesn't satisfy the Second Circuit's test? An investigation, the Court says, quote, \"implies a more focused and sustained inquiry toward a government end.\" Now, the government end in responding to a FOIA request is compliance with FOIA, and somebody has to search for these records and determine whether any exemptions apply, and that would seem to be focused and sustained. So what element is missing?",
  "How do you determine which government ends count and which government ends don't count?",
  "That's the only government -- compliance with FOIA is the only government end that doesn't count?",
  "So a report that goes to a department or agency's compliance with some law that is not directly related to the mission of that department, that would qualify as a -- as a government end for these purposes, but FOIA's the only thing that doesn't count?",
  "Your test, am I right -­ this is page 21 of your brief -- that it has to go to the uncovering of the truth of the matter or inquiring into wrongdoing. Is that your test?",
  "Isn't the test whether -­ the test is whether there's a substantive analysis of facts?",
  "So -- but when the -- when the DOJ pulls together at the end of the fiscal year the number of FOIA requests that it received and calculates the length of time they were pending and discloses that in the annual freedom of act -- Freedom of Information Act report, that is a report?",
  "Every report is a mean -­ means of public disclosure. Does -- the Freedom of Information Act report is a means of public disclosure, that's the reason that Congress required it.",
  "But I'm -- I'm still struggling to find out what the definition is of -- of a report or an investigation. You say it's a substantive analysis of facts. Does not the person who processes a FOIA request have to engage in a substantive analysis of facts to determine whether particular documents fall within the scope of the request, whether certain materials are covered by exemptions?",
  "Well, that's not -- I don't think that's what Melendez-Diaz' footnote 1 says. It says that the State may be able to prove chain of custody by testimony other than the actual individuals who handled the sample, and then it has to take its chances as to whether the trier of fact is going to believe -- is going to believe that. Isn't that right?",
  "But as to those persons who -­",
  "Okay. Go ahead. Yes.",
  "Could we break this down in -- in this way? I see three things that the -- three statements that the -- the State was attempting to -- to prove. The first was that the sample that was tested was the sample that was taken from the defendant. Second was that the standard procedures were followed in this case, and the third was that the result was .21. Would you agree with that? Those are the three things?",
  "All right.",
  "That the sample had not been tampered with. Now, as to the first three, in other words, everything other than the results, could the State prove those things without having -- simply by introducing testimony regarding the way things were generally done in the lab, and ask the jury to infer that the general procedures were followed in this particular case?",
  "It wouldn't be a Confrontation -­",
  "All right. Now, in this case, as I read the record, it seems to me that's what the prosecutor was attempting to do. This is on page 50 of the Joint Appendix. The analyst is beginning to testify, the second answer on page 50: So what we do is we will get the sample in the mail, et cetera. The analyst is beginning to testify about standard lab procedures, and then defense attorney says, \"Your Honor, I'm going to object to what's done in the status quo.\" I take that to mean what is generally done. \"I don't object to what was done in this case.\" So the defense attorney is preventing -- is objecting to the prosecution's attempting to discharge its responsibility with respect to those first three propositions through testimony about standard procedures, and is insisting that the analyst provide the testimony that you say was a violation of the Confrontation Clause; namely, testifying as to what was done in this particular case.",
  "But if the -- if the machine had expelled a piece of paper that said .21, that piece of paper would not be a -- introduction of that piece of paper, the contents of the piece of paper, would not be a violation of the Confrontation Clause?",
  "Well, how can -- how can you debate it? The purpose of the Confrontation Clause is to allow cross-examination. How are you going to cross-examine the machine?",
  "But all of those other things could potentially be proven by indirect evidence, by establishing standard procedures and asking the jury to infer that the standard procedures were followed in this case. They might -- they might believe that; they might not -­",
  "They might make the inference; they might not.",
  "But as to this case, didn't the defendant actually testify that he was drunk at the time of -- at the time when the blood was extracted? He took the stand and he testified that after the accident he went off into the woods and he came upon people who were drinking vodka and he drank, they drank -- what was it -- a gallon of vodka together, and then he went back to the scene and his blood was tested?",
  "Isn't that correct?",
  "But the State can't -­",
  "The State can't immunize those people from testifying. You could have subpoenaed Caylor, couldn't you? You could have asked for a continuance and -- and a subpoena, and brought him in to testify? It's just a question of who has to take the step, right?",
  "Are these lab analysts civil service employees? Are the lab analysts civil service employees?",
  "Is there any way in which your office or prosecutors or the police could cause them not to get promotions if they weren't producing the kind of lab reports that the police and the prosecution might like?",
  "Well, in light of these restrictions, I would like to come back to the question that I understood Justice Scalia to be asking. If the Court were to hold that obtaining a material witness warrant does not violate the Fourth Amendment where the statutory requirements, and in particular establishing materiality, are met, why would it be necessary for the Court to decide whether there's absolute immunity when a prosecutor seeks a material witness warrant?",
  "Is this a -- is this a realistic hypothetical that you've posed? Now, in order to detain someone under the material witness statute, that person, potential witness, must have material testimony, not just relevant testimony, material testimony, testimony that would be of some importance in the criminal prosecution. So your hypothetical is a situation in which there is a witness and this witness has important testimony that could be used in a pending criminal case, and yet the prosecution has absolutely no interest in calling that person as a witness. How often is that going to arise?",
  "Your argument is that the Constitution does not allow a material witness to be detained, so long as the witness says in court that he or she will show up for trial, no matter how much evidence there is that this person poses a great risk of flight? If the person says in court, I will be there, that's the end of it, the person cannot be detained?",
  "Yes.",
  "You might turn out -­",
  "You don't think that an official reading all this Court's cases saying subjective motivation is not proper in determining the application of the Fourth Amendment would be able to think that this would apply here, too? Subjective motivation doesn't count here; what counts is whether there's -- there are objective criteria that would permit the detention?",
  "You seem to acknowledge that in -- a dual motive case would not violate the Fourth Amendment, or wouldn't necessarily violate the Fourth Amendment; isn't that right?",
  "Do you think that a reasonable official would appreciate, well, it's okay for me to have a dual motive, but I have to stop and think: Is my interest in investigating this individual further the but-for cause of my desire to get a material witness warrant? Do you think that was apparent?",
  "Where did you allege that the desire to detain was the sole motive for this?",
  "We're dealing here with a Bivens action?",
  "Under what theory is the history of immunity at some point in the 19th century relevant to the scope of the immunity that should be available in a -- in a Bivens action? What's the theory for that?",
  "Does that make any sense? can understand it with respect to 1983, on the theory that when Congress passed the predecessor of that statute it implicitly intended to adopt the immunities that were available at the time; but when this Court invented the Bivens claim -- in when -- 1971 or whatever -- that the Court -- the Court was -- committed itself to recognizing only those immunities that were available at the time when 1983 was adopted?",
  "Well, I understand your argument with respect to decisions of this Court, and I think that's your strongest argument, but would you concede that that argument does not apply when the precedent on which the police are relying is a decision of one of the courts of appeals or a State supreme court Fourth Amendment decision? In that situation, there will be plenty of avenues for obtaining review of the correctness of those decisions; isn't that right?",
  "Well, it applied its understanding of Belton, which turned out to be different from the understanding of the Arizona Supreme Court in Gant and the understanding of at least four members of this Court when Gant got here.",
  "If I could just come back to my question: Suppose you have a decision in one of the courts of appeals that says certain conduct is permitted under the Fourth Amendment, and the police in that circuit, Federal law enforcement officers in that circuit, follow that precedent. Now, is -- will there not be plenty of opportunities to review the correctness of that decision because the issue may arise in other circuits where the matter isn't settled?",
  "With respect to the incentives that you're talking about, is there really much difference between what would apply in a case like this and what already applies in cases that fall under Krull? Suppose Congress enacts a statute that authorizes a search under particular circumstances, as it did, as was the case in Almeida-Sanchez. Now, under Krull nobody is going to be able to, and no one who is subjected to a search under that statute is going to be able, to challenge, to obtain suppression, unless you can say that a reasonable law enforcement officer couldn't have thought that this statute which was enacted by Congress and signed by the President was a correct interpretation of the Fourth Amendment. Now, maybe there'll be a few cases like that, but in the great majority, the vast majority of cases, the person will not be able to mount such a challenge. So what is the difference between the situation here and the situation that the Court already approved in Krull?",
  "Well, we could leave that open here. We could say that there's no good faith immunity if a reasonable officer couldn't have believed that a prior decision of this Court was a correct interpretation of the Fourth Amendment. Maybe that sounds strange only because we have a higher opinion of ourselves than we do of the Congress and the President.",
  "Well, particularly in light of that, what is wrong with the suggestion that Justice Kagan raised in one of her questions about retaining an exception to the good faith exception for the situation, for the defendant whose case comes up here and results in the overruling of one of this Court's precedents? The Court invented the exclusionary rule. The Court invented the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. Is there anything to prevent the Court from inventing a new exception to the exception to the exclusionary rule?",
  "Would the rule that you're arguing for apply only in the situation where there is a binding precedent that affirmatively approves a particular police practice, or would it also apply in the situation in which there is simply absolutely nothing on the books that prohibits the police practice, so that a reasonable officer wouldn't have any reason to think that the practice was unconstitutional?",
  "Suppose that the -­",
  "Suppose that -- that you had won at the trial level; the judge suppresses everything and dismisses the indictment; and Mr. Tolentino walks out of the courtroom and is observed by the officer that conducted the stop in this case. The officer sees him getting into a car and driving away, even though his license is still suspended. Now, could -- could he be arrested for that?",
  "Even though the officer would have no reason to know that this particular person has a suspended license were it not for the chain of events that followed from the initial allegedly illegal stop?",
  "All right. Let me ask a related question. Suppose that after you filed your suppression motion the -- the State of New York became nervous about this issue and they checked all the surveillance cameras in the vicinity of the stop, and, lo and behold, they found a tape showing Mr. Tolentino driving the car shortly before the stop here. Could he be prosecuted for illegal -- for driving without a license, with a suspended license, using that evidence?",
  "Well, I mean, in light of those two answers, it does seem to me that your real problem here is not with the -- the DMV records. It's with the police officer's observation after the stop that Mr. Tolentino was driving the car.",
  "But that's not the argument you seem to be making. You want to suppress the knowledge that the police derived from the stop that Mr. Tolentino's license is suspended, and you would allow an exception to that only if there was attenuation. But why isn't the simpler solution to a case like this that you can't suppress the knowledge of matters that are in a government record, however you can suppress observations by the police on the scene that flow directly from the illegal stop?",
  "Suppose that when -- when the police stopped this particular car, they saw that Mr. Tolentino was smoking marijuana or snorting cocaine or drinking from a bottle of alcohol or he had somebody tied up, bound and gagged on the back seat of the car. Now, all of those things would clearly be the fruit -­ all those observations would clearly be the fruit of the allegedly illegal stop, right?",
  "Even though they were in plain view, they would all be suppressed, right?",
  "But you're saying that the observation that Mr. Tolentino is at the wheel of the car, that is not suppressed?",
  "Could I go back and -­",

But how is -- let's take another case, where it isn't clear whether the State claims are any more meritorious than the Federal claim.

  "Well, if we agree with you, isn't this going to create an imbalance? Now, in this case, Ms. Rogers was not represented by counsel at this proceeding, was she?",
  "Yes. The State employee sends out the -- the rule to show cause and proof that, evidence that the -- the noncustodial parent is in arrears on the child payments. So, let's see what would happen if counsel is then appointed in one of these cases, where both the custodial parent and the noncustodial parent are indigent and perhaps not very well educated. Counsel is appointed for the noncustodial parent, and counsel comes in and says this is the income of my client, and he's hurt, he was hurt on the job, all his -- his income is Social Security disability benefits, and he doesn't have enough money to pay child support. Now, the custodial -- the non -- the custodial parent who has no attorney says: He's not really hurt, I see him, I see him walking around, he's going hunting, he's shooting baskets, he's driving around in a new car. It may not be the -- the title may not be in his name, he's -- he's out on the street corner, he's buying drugs, he's drinking alcohol, but I don't have a lawyer, and I can't prove any of this. So you've created a great imbalance there, haven't you?",
  "Why is it that -­",
  "Why isn't something like what the Solicitor General suggested adequate here? The State provides a very clear form for the noncustodial parent to fill out, and then in court the judge goes through it step by step: Are you working? How much are you making? Any -- do you have any other money? What expenses do you need for living? And then if you run into some of these complicated legal problems or arguably complicated legal problems that you referred to, maybe in particular cases there would be need for the appointment of counsel. But why isn't that adequate to deal with this situation rather than a categorical rule that you have to have counsel appointed in every case where there's an issue about ability to pay?",
  "Do you think the issue here is more complicated than the issue about whether somebody's probation should be revoked?",
  "There are things the judge could have asked, though, that -- and put on the record, and it might have cleared this up. He could have -- the Petitioner here said he wasn't working and he couldn't work because he had been hurt, so the judge could have asked for medical records to substantiate that. And then the Petitioner admitted that until recently, apparently, he had been taking meth, he had been snorting coke. The judge could have said, all right, you had the money then to buy those drugs; now, where did you get that and why do you no longer have that source of money? He could have gone through a few simple steps, couldn't he, to make this -- to eliminate the problems?",
  "Well, we don't have the Social Security disability form, but if the judge credited that and accepted that your client is -- was unable to work and had only the assets listed on that form, would he not then automatically be -- have shown that he had an inability to pay?",
  "Could you explain how it might have made a difference in this particular case based on the facts of the case? As I understand it, Mr. McBride's theory was that as a result of having to use the independent brake extensively over a long period of time with this wide-bodied cab, his hand got tired and it fell, and it hit the independent brake. Is that -- that's the theory?",
  "Assume you could talk to the jury and the jury says to you: We found negligence, so we don't want to hear about that; and we've found but­ for causation and we don't want to hear about that; now, explain to us why there isn't proximate cause here? What more -- what -- what would you say?",
  "Well, what if the jury says, Well, does it mean that but for the negligence, the injury would not have occurred? Then what would the trial judge say?",
  "Suppose the jury asks, Is it sufficient, is it necessary for the injury to be foreseeable? What does the trial judge say then?",
  "Wasn't Mr. -­",
  "Could I just ask you this factual question? Was it Mr. McBride's theory that his injury resulted from the repetitive use of the independent brake or was it that the -- as a result of the repetitive use his hand fell down and it hit the independent brake, and that was the cause of the injury?",
  "Isn't -- isn't Mr. Frederick right in saying that asking whether something is probable is very different from asking whether it's foreseeable?",
  "Well, if it's probable it's foreseeable, but it can be foreseeable even though it's not probable.",
  "Would there be anything unconstitutional about a system that worked roughly like this? At the beginning -- at some point prior to each election cycle, the commission that supervises this law would make a calculation about how much money would be needed for a candidate in a gubernatorial race or a State senate race or an assembly race, if that's what it's called in Arizona, to get that candidate's message out to the electorate, and that would be the amount of the public funding, period.",
  "Suppose the -- suppose the Court after this argument sent you a letter saying if you would like to file an additional brief, you have the opportunity to do so, and we're not going to allow your opponent to file a brief. Would you take advantage of that opportunity?",
  "Now, if we said you can file an extra brief, but if you do that your opponent will also be able to file an extra brief. Would that figure in your thinking?",
  "Well, there are States that have public funding without having a matching fund provision. I would appreciate it if you would compare these two regimes. The first is exactly what Arizona has now. The second is exactly what Arizona has now minus the matching fund provision. So under the second one you have very strict contribution limits, and you have reporting of all contributions. Now, why does the addition of the matching fund provision serve an anticorruption interest?",
  "But even if it is the case that those candidates who choose not to participate are willing to spend additional money even though it triggers matching funds, I don't see what that proves. A candidate who is deciding whether to participate or not presumably makes a calculation at the beginning: Do I want to spend more than the matching fund amount, even though I know that if I do that, the other side will get additional money? Now, if they say, no, I don't -- I'm not going to do it under those circumstances, they will take the public financing. And if they choose the private financing, it means they probably made a decision going in that they're going to -- they're going to be one of those who is willing to suffer the consequences of spending over the amount. So I don't see what this -- I don't see what that proves.",
  "Could I ask z question that goes back to Justice Kennedy's question, which I don't think you fully had a chance to -- or fully answered? And that has to do with the independent expenditures. Let's say there are two candidates running for governor, and one who is a participating candidate is taking a position on a very controversial Arizona issue with which I disagree, and the other is a non-participating candidate who is taking a position on that controversial issue and I agree with that. Now, if I choose to run an ad, pay for an ad supporting the non-participating candidate, I know that the -- the candidate that I dislike on that issue is going to get an additional amount of funds, and -- but if I choose to run an ad supporting the participating candidate, the opposite doesn't happen. Now, why isn't that a clear-cut discrimination based on the content of speech?",
  "But if I'm the independent -- if I'm the independent expenditure maker, I haven't made a choice at the beginning. I haven't decided to participate or not participate. What I care about is the issue that's being debated between these two candidates.",
  "But would you agree that the matching fund provision by itself does not serve an anticorruption purpose?",
  "What you just said was that this law aims to allow publicly financed candidates to run on the same footing as privately financed candidates; isn't that right?",
  "Right, and that's equal -­",
  "-- that's equal -- that's leveling the playing field, isn't it?",
  "What do you think is the difference between the standard that the district court was required to apply at the certification stage on the question whether there was a company-wide policy and the -- the standard that would be applied on the merits?",
  "I understand your answer to Justice Kennedy's question to be that this typical company would be in violation of Title VII; is that correct?",
  "That's what the -- and that's what the academic literature on which your theory is based includes; isn't that right?",
  "So, you have the company that is absolutely typical of the entire American workforce, and let's say every single -- there weren't any variations. Every single company had exactly the same profile. Then you would say every single company is in violation of Title VII?",
  "The statute speaks of the intent of the defendant. The defendant must intend to prevent the communication of information about a Federal offense or a possible Federal offense to a law enforcement officer who happens to be a Federal law enforcement officer. So, it's all a matter of intent. Where do you get this question of whether it's possible or likely or certain or whatever that the information will eventually get to a Federal law enforcement officer? Isn't it -- isn't it simply what is in the mind of the defendant?",
  "What do you say that is -­",
  "The reasonable likelihood that this person who was killed -- now, you say \"realistic likelihood.\"",
  "Well, why don't we pick the standard that is set out in the text of the statute? Let me give you this example: Let's -- let's hypothesize a very cold, calculating, rational defendant who is planning a Federal crime, let's say the hijacking of an airplane over international waters, and this defendant finds out that his mother has learned about the plot. Now, he says, well, you know, I think there's a one-tenth of 1 percent chance that mom is going to go to the FBI and turn me in, but in order to prevent that, I'm going to kill her. I intend -- I kill her with the -- for the purpose of preventing her from going to the FBI, even though I think very, very, very unlikely she's going to do that. Hasn't that defendant violated this statute?",
  "The issue -- the issue here is the sufficiency of the evidence. So -- so -- and the question is whether a reasonable juror could adopt a certain view of the facts. Now, couldn't a reasonable juror in this situation take this view of the facts? Your client killed Officer Horner simply because your client didn't want to go to jail. He didn't particularly care whether he was going to be prosecuted in State court or Federal court; he just didn't want to go to jail. So his intent was to prevent the communication of information about the crimes that were being planned to any law enforcement officer who could send him to jail, and that would include a State officer; it also would include a Federal officer. And, therefore, there's a violation of the statute. Now, what's wrong with that view of the facts?",
  "No, because if there were -­ if the only crimes that were being planned were State offenses, then there would be no chance that -- that the conveying of that information to a Federal law enforcement officer would send the person to jail.",
  "They're planning -- they're planning to hold up a convenience store. It's not a Federal offense; it's a State offense.",
  "So, the person isn't going to go to jail on a Federal charge.",
  "Well, are you saying that there is no possible offense that's only a violation of State law and Federal law?",
  "All right.",
  "Let me give you a hypothetical similar to the one that I gave your -- your friend. Two men are sitting on a park bench planning the commission of a Federal crime, hijacking of an airplane, and they think they're by themselves; so they're talking about this, and then after they've had a discussion they turn around and they see there's somebody standing very close by; and so they say we have to kill this person to prevent him from going to the FBI, and so they do, and they're prosecuted under this statute. But then at trial they bring out evidence that the person didn't speak a word of English, only spoke Russian. So there wasn't any possibility whatsoever that this person was going to report that to the FBI or any law enforcement officer. Violation of this statute or not?",
  "So a realistic probability relates only to the question of whether it would have been conveyed to a Federal officer as opposed to some other law enforcement officer?",
  "Let's say the case -- that this case arises -- exactly this case arises in two different adjacent jurisdictions. In one, the local sheriff and the local district attorney hate the Feds. They never talk to them unless they absolutely have to. And so if Officer Horner had taken the information that he learned to the local sheriff, there's no chance whatsoever that they would have referred that over to the FBI or the U.S. attorney for prosecution in Federal Court, so no realistic possibility there. In the other jurisdiction, right next door, the local sheriff and the local DA don't want to be bothered with bank robbery trials. They send all of those over to the FBI and the U.S. attorney, so there's a very high probability the information would have gotten to the Federal authorities. Now, would this case come out differently depending on the jurisdiction?",
  "So if a defendant has in mind a particular officer, then there's a potential violation of the statute, but if the defendant just kills for the purpose of preventing this from going to any Federal -- any officer who might happen to be a Federal officer, then there's no violation under this -­ under this reading of the statute?",
  "Under the interpretation that's been suggested to you, that would be the distinction?",
  "Suppose a generic -- suppose that the FDA issued a rule that says a generic drug manufacturer has no obligation to request a change in labeling. Could a generic drug manufacturer be held liable on a failure to warn claim on the theory that it could have lobbied the FDA to change the rule that says that the generic drug manufacturer has no obligation to ask for a change in labeling?",
  "Isn't that why -- isn't that where your theory leads?",
  "But your theory is that they have a duty to pursue an informal process that is nowhere provided for under the FDA rules; and so I don't -- so it's a duty to lobby the FDA basically to change the rules, isn't that right?",
  "Assuming that they're correct in their interpretation of their own regulations.",
  "Has the FDA made any calculation of the economic consequences of imposing this duty on generic drug manufacturers? I don't know whether this is a good idea or not, but it does seem to me that it may significantly increase the costs for generic drug manufacturers, and therefore counteract one of the objectives of the statute, which was to provide generic drugs at a low cost.",
  "If the challenger has the burden of persuasion, wouldn't it almost go without saying that the challenger would also have the burden of production on the issue of invalidity? So what would be added then by -- what role is played then by that sentence, a patent shall be presumed valid?",
  "If I could take you back to first principles, which is where you started, I have three problems in seeing your interpretation in the language of section 282. First, the statute says the burden of establishing invalidity of a patent, et cetera, et cetera, shall rest on the parties asserting such invalidity. If Congress wanted to impose a clear and convincing burden, why in the world would they not have said that expressly in that sentence? Number two, if the first sentence, \"a patent shall be presumed valid,\" means that -- is talking about the burden, then it's superfluous, because that's dealt with in the second sentence. And, third, the phrase \"shall be presumed valid\" doesn't seem to me at all to suggest clear and convincing evidence. A presumption normally doesn't have anything to do with clear and convincing evidence. Most presumptions can be disproved by much less than clear and convincing evidence. So how do you read that in -- your -- your position into the language of the statute?",
  "I've gotten a lot smarter since then.",
  "But that ground doesn't carry very much weight when the matter was never considered by the PTO.",
  "Why is -- why is re-examination sufficient to answer the concerns that Justice Breyer mentioned, when re-examination can't consider certain issues, and a case such as this doesn't necessarily have to be stayed while re-examination takes place?",
  "Do you think that's -- do you think that's consistent with what Congress thought about rehabilitation when it adopted the Sentencing Reform Act? And you discuss their thinking, and I think accurately, in your brief, but was their thinking simply that rehabilitation is very feasible and it's reasonably predictable whether somebody can be rehabilitated or has been rehabilitated so long as it's done outside of prison, but it just doesn't work in prison? Was that their thinking?",
  "That's only one-half of what the thinking was at the time about rehabilitation. The thinking was that -- that some people were being sentenced to coercive rehabilitation, but also that other people were being paroled before they should be on the theory that they had been rehabilitated. It was a general skepticism about rehabilitation, and that is inconsistent with the idea that you can take rehabilitation into account in going down, but you can't take rehabilitation into account in going up.",
  "Yes, but that's different from saying that a lower sentence can be imposed on the theory that with rehabilitation outside of prison, a lengthier sentence isn't needed. Would you agree that when the guidelines were mandatory a judge could not sentence to -- to additional time, certainly not additional time outside the guideline range for the purpose of rehabilitation, but the judge also generally could not depart below the guideline range on the theory that this defendant had led a life of crime because the defendant lacked vocational skills or the defendant was dependent on drugs or alcohol, and with treatment outside of incarceration, those problems which had led to the criminality could be alleviated?",
  "Suppose the judge thinks that a -- a defendant would benefit from a type of a vocational or educational training that may be available in prison but that is not available in -- on the outside in the particular community where this defendant resides? What would the judge do then?",
  "No, what if that's not -­",
  "What if it's not available in the community on the outside?",
  "Are you arguing for something like a plain statement rule, if the judge says plainly, I'm increasing your sentence so you can get rehabilitation, then there's a problem? Or would there possibly be situations in which one could infer that the desire to provide for rehabilitation in prison had influenced the sentence? For example, choosing a sentence that is just long enough to allow somebody to take advantage of a particular rehabilitation program in a -- in a prison, or where the judge goes on and on and on about the need for rehabilitation for this -­ vocational training for this prisoner?",
  "At what point in this -- in what point in this cascade did the displacement occur?",

  "How does a district judge decide what is reasonable and cost-effective? There are considerations -- this is not a situation in which the emission of greenhouse gases can be totally prohibited.",
  "There are other -- there are countervailing interests. So how does the court -- how can a district court balance those interests?",
  "But do you seriously argue this isn't -- this isn't orders of magnitude more complicated than that case?",
  "And anybody who is a substantial contributor could be sued?",
  "Even if you won and the district court imposed some sort of limit would be there any other obstacle to other plaintiffs bringing suits and another district court issuing a different standard?",
  "In setting these standards, there would somebody difficult trade-offs, wouldn't there? Could you just explain in concrete terms how a district judge would deal with those? Let -- and just determining the facts is going to be hard enough, but let's assume all the facts are proven, there's not a dispute about the facts. So that if a certain reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is ordered, that will have this effect, it will increase the cost of electricity by a certain amount, and that will produce certain effects. It will result in the loss of a certain number of jobs, it will mean that consumers will have less money to spend on other -- other things. Some people will not be able to have air conditioning in the summer. That will have health effects. How is the district judge -- what standard does the district judge have to decide those? It's just -- what is it, just what's reasonable?",
  "Do you agree that the -- do you agree that the fiduciary exception is well established as a general matter?",
  "So if this cause arose in a different context with a different trustee, the position of the United States would be that under Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence there is a fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege?",
  "The thrust of what -- my understanding of the thrust of what Justice Sotomayor was asking is something like the following: It's easy to understand how there can be competing government interests when you're talking about some, the management of lands, things of that nature. But when you're just talking about managing funds, what competing interests can there be in practical terms? If you assume arguendo that this exception applies to a private trustee, why should it not apply to the government in practical terms?",
  "Well, what do you make of the fact that the Uniform Trust Code reserves decision on the question whether there is a fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege? That seems to suggest that as a general matter, this is not as well-established as you seem to argue.",
  "If we assume for the sake of argument that a private trustee may, using the private trustee's own fund, hire an attorney to obtain prospective advice about liability, does that doom your argument here for the reason that the government claims it has no ability to set up a system like this, to have some attorneys in the solicitor's office provide advice regarding the management of the funds and other attorneys in the solicitor's office provide advice regarding -- regarding the possibility of prospective liability in light of all of these suits that you mentioned?",
  "But common reliance -­",

  "The Basic presumption can be -- can the Basic presumption be rebutted at the certification stage?",
  "Can it be rebutted by proof other than proof generally disproving the efficiency of the market?",
  "And what is that based on, the footnote in Basic?",
  "Well, that's pretty thin, isn't it? It's a -- it's dictum in a footnote in an opinion issued at a time when conditional class certification was permitted. Do you have anything else to support that?",
  "Do you have anything in the rule to support that?",
  "Yes.",
  "What do you say to -- to the following argument, that there are some economists who say that, even in a market that is generally efficient, there can be instances in which the market does not incorporate certain statements into the price of a stock; and therefore even when it is demonstrated that the market meets the test for efficiency that the lower courts have settled upon in the wake of Basic, the defendant in a -- in a class action where there is reliance on the Basic presumption should be permitted at the class certification stage to prove that the allegedly fraudulent statements had no impact on price, and by doing that destroy the theory that the class relied on the statements, because they relied on the price which incorporated the statements?",
  "You seem to -- maybe I don't understand your argument, but you and Mr. Boies seem to be arguing that whether there is a common question -­ that it is a common question whether there is a common question, and therefore that has to wait until the merits stage. Is that what you're saying?",
  "And if they show that the statement was not incorporated in the price, in the price, and they're not claiming that they relied, that every member of the class actually relied on the statement, they're all claiming they relied on the price - if they show that the statement wasn't incorporated in the price, then why doesn't reliance cease to be a common issue and become a question of an individual issue that would have to be proved by each, each member of the class?",
  "Yeah, but the fact that they would lose on the merits doesn't necessarily mean that they are entitled to class certification.",
  "Suppose -- what would happen in this situation? A defendant is convicted under a State statute that says that anybody who sells between 1 ounces -- 1 ounce and 5 ounces of a particular controlled substance is guilty of a felony and may be punished by imprisonment for a certain amount of time. And then the State repeals that provision altogether and enacts a new provision that says anybody who sells between 1 ounces -- 1 ounce and 8 ounces is punishable by a certain penalty. And now the question comes up what -- what penalty does the court look at with respect to the earlier offense that no longer exists for which the defendant was convicted?",
  "What if the legislature decreases the penalty because it really has taken a different -- a new look at the nature of the offense and has come to the conclusion that this really is not nearly as serious as we -- as we previously thought? So why should the prior judgment about the severity of the offense be taken into account under ACCA?",
  "But what if -­",
  "What if they had repudiated their prior normative judgment? And -- and even -- what if they even had made it -- made the new sentence retroactive, but a particular defendant was no longer in prison, so wasn't on parole, so there was nothing -­ there was no way that this could have any effect on that person?",
  "One of the Respondents argues that the statute would permit, does permit, the use of this information for what they call a counter­ detailing effort. Is that correct?",

  "Did you make that argument below? Is that a change in your position?",
  "Well, the court of appeals on page 22a of the petition, summarizing what it understood you to be arguing, says: \"The statute only imposes restrictions on the sale or use of such data for marketing or promoting a prescription drug.\" That was an inaccurate characterization of your -- the Second Circuit did not understand your argument?",
  "Could you please -- could you please answer yes or no? If you're changing your position, you're changing your position. It seems to me this is an important point, and if the Second Circuit based its decision on a misunderstanding of Vermont's interpretation of its own statute, I would think you would at least bring that out in the petition for rehearing.",
  "And you did not?",
  "What about the doctor who didn't want the information distributed to anybody, academic researchers, anybody? Does the law give that -- give the doctor that option?",
  "Well, I found this statute very difficult to understand, but maybe you can explain what's -- what I found a bit puzzling. The statute talks about a commitment in a private capacity to the interests of others. Now, I take it that that commitment doesn't have to be something contractual. When you're talking about relatives, that would assume -- that that would include emotional commitments to the relatives who are listed; is that correct?",
  "Not -- not a financial interest of the public official, a financial interest of the -- the relative or the person who is substantially similar to a relative. Or is that wrong?",
  "Maybe if I give you an example it will be clearer. Let's take somebody who is within the third degree of consanguinity. So that would include second cousins?",
  "Okay. Now, let's say a public officer is considering something that would affect everybody's property taxes in town or a measure that would affect the benefits or the wages of everybody who works for the town. And this official has a second cousin whose property taxes would be affected or works for the town, and the second cousin's wages or benefits would be affected. Now, would that person have to recuse?",
  "Well, if I were a public officer I would find it very difficult to figure out whether a reasonable person would think that an effect on my second cousin's property taxes would require -­ would materially affect my judgment. But it's even worse than that because of the \"substantially similar.\" So the public officer not only has to think about second cousins; the person has to think about everybody who is like a second cousin to him or her. I have no idea how you -- how you go about that.",
  "This statute doesn't apply just to voting. It says that the public officer shall not vote upon or advocate the passage or failure of the message.",
  "Advocating the passage or failure of the message is surely speech in the ordinary understanding of the concept.",
  "In several recent cases the Court has taken pains to make the point that it is not going to recognize any new categories of unprotected speech. But the argument that you seem to be endorsing now in response to some questions is that there is this new category of unprotected speech, which is advocacy of the passage of legislation when a recusal statute comes into play.",
  "What about the rules of civility in the houses of Congress? There are things that a member of the Senate, for example, cannot say about another Senator, or make a personal attack. That would be protected by the First Amendment if the Senator stepped outside the door. Are those -- is there First Amendment protection for that? Do they have -- do those rules have to pass First Amendment scrutiny?",
  "If they based their decision solely on the -- on the fact that Vasquez had been the campaign manager in the past and he was a great campaign manager, and perhaps Carrigan would like him to be his campaign manager in the future, would there be a problem then?",
  "Well, suppose somebody had made extensive independent expenditures in support of the -- the public officer's prior campaign, and the public officer may hope that they -- similar expenditures will be made in the future. Would that be a basis?",
  "Why not?",
  "Are you asking us to adopt a rule that is good for this one case only?",
  "You gave -- or is there -- could you state the rule in broader terms or more neutral terms? And you gave three reasons why we should reverse. One, Congress hasn't created a cause of action here. Well, Congress has never created causes of action, never creates a cause of action in any case in the Ex parte Young line or cases like that. The Supremacy Clause, because this is a Spending Clause -- this was an act under the Spending Clause. But you're not asking us to hold that Spending Clause legislation can never pre-empt State legislation, I take it. And then the language of 30(A), where you -- are you arguing that 30 -- that the Medicaid Act affirmatively precludes any action like this? I don't understand that -- is -- is any of those arguments sufficient by itself, or do you have to take them all together, and you're asking for a rule that only applies here?",
  "Well, suppose the plaintiffs here were facing an imminent State enforcement action. Would your argument be different?",
  "But how does that square with the argument that you made that -- relying on separation of powers, the Spending Clause, and the language of 30(A)? All of those are still in play --",
  "-- in that situation.",
  "What is your response to the argument that the equitable power exercised in Ex parte Young and similar cases is limited to certain specific situations such as where there is an imminent threat of the State enforcement action, and a few others where there's a trespass, where there's a clearly defined Federal right? I mean, it doesn't encompass every situation in which the plaintiff simply has Article III standing and wants to obtain an injunction that a particular State law is pre-empted by Federal law.",
  "No, but the agency approves rates and someone who's dissatisfied with the rates sues and says these rates are ridiculously low.",
  "They still can sue --",
  "Well, how do you know they're going to lose the litigation? Why should they lose the litigation if it's really -- if there really is a cause of action there? Some of the Medicaid rates are very low, aren't they?",
  "It's the period from the enactment of SORNA until the adoption of the SMART guidelines, right? That's what we're talking about?",
  "What would happen in -- in this situation: Someone is convicted of a sex offense before SORNA is enacted; then shortly after the statute is enacted, the person moves to a new State, does not register; then after that, the Attorney General, exercising the authority that you say he has under -­ exercising -- excuse me, exercising the authority under subsection (d), determines that SORNA shouldn't apply to people who were convicted of offenses before its enactment? Would that person have committed a criminal offense?",
  "Well, if Congress wasn't sure whether it wanted -- whether it was appropriate to apply SORNA retroactively, then I just -- and, therefore, was willing to leave that to the Attorney General, then I don't understand why it would have made the Act applicable immediately upon enactment -­",
  "-- pending a determination by the Attorney General.",
  "Do you want us to hold that there is a right to counsel whenever a petitioner asserts a claim that could not have been asserted at an earlier point in the proceedings?",
  "That's a very far-reaching proposition that extends well beyond claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial, wouldn't it?",
  "If many years after someone is convicted an allegation is made that the prosecution failed to turn over exculpatory evidence and that the information supporting the claim has just recently come to light and could not have been previously discovered, there would be a right to counsel there.",
  "That would be the case?",
  "What if the - -",
  "I'm sorry. What if the ineffective assistance of counsel claim is closely related to other claims that petitioner wants to raise in an initial postconviction relief proceeding? Counsel at trial was ineffective for failing to do A, B, C, and D, and all of those are bases for relief. And now I want to argue with new counsel in the first postconviction proceeding not only that counsel was ineffective at trial but also that all of these other claims are meritorious. Are you saying that the counsel that -- to whom the Petitioner has a right is limited to making only the ineffective assistance of counsel claim and cannot go on and represent the petitioner on these other claims?",
  "Why isn't that where your argument leads, to the proposition that you can never procedurally default irrevocably an ineffective assistance of counsel claim?",
  "But there can't be a claim - -",
  "What I understand you to be saying is exactly that. A line has to be drawn somewhere. Enough is enough; it can't go on forever.",
  "And the sensible place to draw the line, in your view, is after the first-tier review. That's your argument, right?",
  "But the problem with that is that you can answer that by saying, yes, we have to draw a line someplace; and the Court has already done it, and it did it in Douglas, and it said it was after the first tier of review on direct appeal. It's exactly the same argument, except where the law stands now the line is drawn at a different place on the same principle.",
  "It has to be drawn someplace.",
  "If there's a right to counsel whenever someone asserts a claim that couldn't have been raised earlier, why does the State not have the obligation to provide counsel to contest the constitutionality of the representation that was provided on appeal?",
  "Well, the trial judge doesn't have to be wrong for there to be an ineffective assistance of counsel claim at trial?",
  "The question is whether there's cause external to the petitioner to overcome the procedural default. So, if you went down that road, would the petitioner representing himself or herself, not have to show that, I would have raised a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, and I would have won on that, were it not for the fact that the State appointed counsel for me and led me astray and prevented me from raising this meritorious argument - - isn't that where that would have to go?",
  "Where do we look -- where do we look to see that it's standard practice for local counsel throughout the country to contact out-of-State counsel when something like this is received? I remember a case from the Federal system in which local counsel appeared and did exactly what was done here, moved the admission of an out-of-State criminal defense attorney, who then tried the case for a year, got sick, and the judge said to the local -- local counsel: Come on in; you're going to take over this trial and try it for the next 6 months. And the local counsel said: Whoa, I only signed up to move the admission of this fellow. The judge said: That's too bad; you're counsel of record, and you have to take over the case. I don't understand that what is alleged to have occurred here is that far out of the ordinary.",
  "Could we find --",
  "Putting aside the question of local counsel, could we find that there was an abandonment if the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell continued to represent Mr. Maples after the two young attorneys left the firm?",
  "And does the record show that they -- they did not represent Mr. Maples, that this was done purely by the two attorneys? Is there a finding by a court on that?",
  "You can see from these questions that the arguments that you're making in this capital case, which is sui generis, are pushing the Court to consider rules that would have far-reaching effect, such as a rule that places upon a clerk of the court a constitutional obligation to serve counsel with important documents in the case similar to the constitutional obligation to serve initial process in the case. And the question that I would like to ask is whether this -- the -- whether you as the Solicitor General or the Attorney General of Alabama have an obligation to push this matter in this way. This is a case where -- as I said, it's a capital case, as we all recognize. Mr. Maples has lost his right to appeal through no fault of his own, through a series of very unusual and unfortunate circumstances. Now, when his attorneys moved to file an out-of-time appeal, why wouldn't you just consent to that? If he did not receive an effective assistance of counsel at trial, why not get a decision on the merits on that? Why push this -- this technical argument?",
  "There's no --",
  "There's no possibility under Alabama rules for an out-of-time appeal in this circumstance? No extension?",
  "But is that a discretionary matter or is that a flat rule, once you've passed a certain time deadline, you're out of -- you're out of luck; there's no opportunity where there's good cause for an extension?",
  "What is troubling to me about the abandonment argument is that -- is the fear that if the Court says that abandonment is cause, there will be many, many cases in which the allegation is: My attorney wasn't just ineffective and negligent; the attorney was so bad that the attorney in effect abandoned me. And that will substantially change existing law. Now, how can that be prevented?",
  "What is the rule that you want us to adopt?",
  "So, everybody in prison is in custody --",
  "-- at all times.",
  "So, if you want to question anybody in prison about anything --",
  "-- you have to give a Miranda warning.",
  "What sense does that make? Why is one more in custody depending on the subject that the police want to question the person about?",
  "So, whenever they -- whenever a prisoner is isolated and questioned about a crime, no matter where it occurs, a Miranda warning has to be given?",
  "About a possible crime?",
  "So, if a prisoner is stabbed in the yard and there are 50 prisoners in the yard at the time and the prison guards want to question everybody to see what they saw, they all have to be given Miranda warnings?",
  "Well --",
  "If it's a witness in the outside world, the witness is unlikely to be in custody.",
  "It does.",
  "So, these -- all these people in your view are in custody, and they all are being asked questions that may incriminate them --",
  "-- and they don't have to be given Miranda warnings unless they're suspects.",
  "And when will that not occur? In my hypothetical of the stabbing in the yard, you mean that you think the guards are going to say: Okay, all you guys stay here; now we're all -- we're going to question each of you individually with everybody else, the 49 other prisoners present.",
  "And then they'll be isolated.",
  "So, they all will get Miranda warnings.",
  "Can I ask you this? Suppose you have this situation: The police officers go to a prison. The -- a prisoner is brought to an interview room, and the police officers are there with the prisoner in the interview room. And they say to him: We're investigating allegations that you committed child abuse. Now, you're free to leave if you want to, and we'll see that you go back to your cell right away. He says, no, no, I want to explain this; I welcome this opportunity to speak to you. Do they have to give him Miranda warnings.",
  "Well, they said: We'd like to talk to you about it, but you don't have to talk to us; you're free to go. And he says immediately: No, no, there's a misunderstanding here; I want to explain this; I am glad you came and asked me about this; I don't want to go back to my cell. And you say that's coercive.",
  "Could Congress grant copyright protection to works that had lost that protection due to the expiration of the period that was provided for under then -- under previous law?",
  "But doesn't this -- doesn't section 514 provide copyright protection for works that were created by people who are long since dead?",
  "So, I don't understand the limit that you were just suggesting.",
  "Do they have to be dead for some period of time before --",
  "-- Congress is unable to give them back their copyright?",
  "Doesn't that show at most that retroactive protection can be granted when there is an enormous interest in doing so, namely, the establishment of a uniform copyright system at the beginning of the country? Because if Congress had not done that and had said -- the alternative would be to say things can be copyrighted going forward, then you would have different copyright laws in all of the States.",
  "Right.",
  "Mr. Laycock, the ministerial exception is not something new. It has been widely recognized, as Justice Sotomayor mentioned, by the courts of appeals going back 40 years. So, we can see how the recognition of this exception within -- with certain contours has worked out. And how has it worked out over those past 40 years? Have there been a great many cases, a significant number of cases, involving the kinds of things that Justice Sotomayor is certainly rightly concerned about, instances in which ministers have been fired for reporting criminal violations and that sort of thing?",
  "But I thought with a lot of deference to the church's understanding of whether someone is a minister.",
  "Well, Mr. Laycock, could you - -",
  "Mr. Laycock, doesn't this inquiry illustrate the problems that will necessarily occur if you get into a pretext analysis? The question of was she told that she had violated the church's teaching about suing in a civil tribunal? Well, that depends. The significance of -- let's assume she wasn't told. The significance of that depends on how central a teaching of Lutheranism this is. It's like -- suppose a Catholic priest got married and the bishop said, I'm removing you from your parish because of your conduct. Now, there wouldn't be much question about why that was done. So, you'd have to get in, what did Martin Luther actually say about - - about suing the church or other Christians in a civil tribunal? Is this really a central tenet of Lutheranism? Isn't that the problem with going into this pretext analysis?",
  "Well, do you dispute the proposition that one of the central concerns of the Establishment Clause was preventing the government from choosing ministers? When there was an established church, the government chose the ministers or had a say in choosing the ministers. And the Establishment Clause, many argue, was centrally focused on eliminating that governmental power. Now, do you dispute that?",
  "When you say that, are you not implicitly making a judgment about the relative importance of the Catholic doctrine that only males can be ordained as priests and the Lutheran doctrine that a Lutheran should not sue the church in civil courts? I don't see any distinction between -- I can't reconcile your position on those two issues without coming to the conclusion that you think that the Catholic doctrine is older, stronger, and entitled to more respect than the Lutheran doctrine.",
  "Well, if -- if the plaintiff proceeded that way, would she be entitled to -- I assume she would -- introduce testimony by experts on Lutheranism, theologians, professors of religion about how the -- about this -- this tenet, and it isn't really -- they might say, well, it's really not that strong, and it once was, but it's faded, and it's not - - it's not widely enforced. And then you'd have experts on the other side, and you'd have a court and a lay jury deciding how important this really is to Lutherans. Is that how that would play out?",
  "How are you going to avoid that? I just don't see it.",
  "No, it's not irrelevant. I've seen dozens and dozens and dozens of pretext cases, and in practically every pretext case that I've seen, one of the central issues is whether the reason that was proffered by the employer is the real reason, is an important reason for that, for that employer, and whether they really think it's important and whether they apply it across the board. That's almost always a big part of the case. And once you get into that, you're going to get into questions of -- of religious doctrine. I just don't see it. Let me give you an example of a real case. A nun wanted to be -- wanted a tenured position teaching canon law at Catholic University, and she claimed that she was denied tenure because of her -- because of her gender. Now, there the university might argue, no, she was -- and did argue -- she's denied tenure because of the quality of her -- of her scholarship. And, okay, now, if you try that pretext issue, the issue is going to be what is the real quality of her canon law scholarship? And you're going to have the judge and the jury decide whether the particular writings on canon law are -- make a contribution to canon law scholarship. How can something like that be tried, without getting into religious issues?",
  "Well, if I could just come back to the example of the canon law professor, because I still don't see how the -- the approach that the Solicitor General is recognizing -- is recommending could -- can eliminate the problems involved in pretext. So, the -- as I understood her -- her answer, it was that you couldn't look into the question of whether the professor's canon law scholarship was really good canon law scholarship, but you could try the issue of sex discrimination based on other evidence. So, maybe there's some stray remarks here and there about a woman teaching canon law. Now, a response to that might be that wasn't the real reason, and if you just look at the scholarship and you see how miserable it is and how inconsistent it is with church doctrine, you can see that that's the real reason. So, you just cannot get away from evaluating religious issues.",
  "It antedated -- did it not antedate the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act?",
  "So, wouldn't -- shouldn't we assume that Congress -- that Congress assumed that it would continue to apply to the ADA, just as it applied to Title VII.",
  "The curious thing about this case is that the statutory language seems to me to speak quite clearly to some theory of causation. Any injury occurring as the result of operations conducted on the outer continental shelf. That's -- that's causation. Maybe it's but-for, maybe it's proximate, but it's some -- some species of causation. And yet, nobody wants this really to be -- neither you nor your adversary nor the Government wants this to be a -- to be based on causation. Everyone wants to smuggle something else into -- into here -- into this.",
  "Suppose the facts of this case were changed a little bit so that the Respondent, instead of spending 98 percent of his time on an oil rig doing things that he did there, actually spent only 20 percent of his time there, and he spent 80 percent of his time on land doing what he was supposed to be doing at the time of the accident. This particular operation produced so much scrap metal, he had to spend 80 percent of his time going around with a forklift gathering it up. Now, would this case come out the same way then?",
  "Then how does that -- I don't see how you get this result out of the statutory language, because the causal connection between the operations on the shelf and the accident are precisely the same in the two situations. Whether he spends 98 percent of his time on the rig or 2 percent of his time on the rig, that makes no difference whatsoever in the causal relationship.",
  "Well, the trouble is that I have no idea what that means. Now, they have the example of an accountant on land who spends all of his time doing accounting work for the -- for the oil rig. Why isn't there a substantial connection there? Were it not for the operations on the oil rig, this guy would be out of work or he'd be doing something completely different. I don't understand that.",
  "How can you -- how can you square your position with what 2254(d) says, that there must be an unreasonable application of clearly established law? What the intermediate appellate court did was not an unreasonable application or -- let's assume for the sake of argument it was not an unreasonable application of clearly established law when they did it. So, how do you get around that?",
  "And the other is it was --",
  "It was contrary to. How was it contrary to?",
  "Your answer is that the State in that -- the State courts in that situation would entertain the claim. But what if they didn't?",
  "How?",
  "What if it was a -- what if it was case like Gideon v. Wainwright?",
  "If the claim -- the claim under Graham is a different claim from any previous claim. Doesn't that get you out from under it?",
  "But do you think that a case like Graham or Atkins applies only to those who -- whose cases are pending on direct review at the time when the case was decided, or do you think it applies to others?",
  "No, if someone -- if a juvenile is sentenced to death prior to the decision, and -- I'm sorry -- and, yes, you think it applies only if it comes down during that period?",
  "Can you imagine any statutory language that would eliminate the right, the ability of the parties to enter into an arbitration agreement other than language that expressly prohibits the waiver of the right to sue in court in favor of arbitration?",
  "Now, if he had been convicted of a lesser offense that was not a crime involving moral turpitude, he would not be eligible for the waiver; isn't that right?",
  "Isn't that -­",
  "But isn't that strange? Suppose you have somebody who's charged with a lesser offense that -- that doesn't involve moral turpitude and a greater offense that does, and the defense attorney comes to the client and says: I've got great news; the prosecutor will take a plea to the lesser offense and drop the greater one. I guess that would be -- that would be bad, potentially bad advice, because he ought to plead to the more serious offense because then he would be eligible for a waiver.",
  "Right.",
  "That is so bizarre it makes me -- that he's pleading to prove that what he did was really turpitudinous. It makes me think that maybe the en banc Ninth Circuit was right, that this whole line of cases has gone off along the wrong track quite a while ago.",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "Do you know potentially how many people may be affected by the decision in this case?",
  "But do you know how many times this has come up in cases over, let's say, the past 5 years?",
  "Well, how would this work with respect to individuals who have been arrested for serious offenses? Let's say someone has been arrested for -- for assault. Say it's a case of domestic violence, assault. Would that be enough to justify a search?",
  "No, I understand. You say that you don't want to draw that line; you want to apply it to -­",
  "-- to everybody, and I'm asking you whether the mere fact that someone has been arrested for a violent offense would in your judgment be sufficient to provide reasonable suspicion.",
  "I'm confused about your -­",
  "-- your position. Suppose a jurisdiction has the policy of requiring every inmate who is arrested and is going to be held in custody to disrobe and take a shower and apply medication for the prevention of the spread of lice and is observed while this is taking place from some distance by a corrections officer, let's say 10 feet away. Is that -- does that require reasonable suspicion?",
  "And so, your -- your only concern is searches that go further than that.",
  "Is there -- could I just follow up on that? Is there a dispute of fact as to whether anything beyond that occurred in Burlington County?",
  "Would you say that regardless of the offense for which the person is arrested? There have been some stories in the news recently about cities that have taken to arresting people for traffic citations. So, suppose someone is just arrested because they have a lot of tickets for being caught on speed cameras, let's say. That person can be subjected to the searches that you're describing?",
  "Suppose we accept the Petitioner's concession that it is permissible to require everybody who is arrested to disrobe and shower under the observation of the corrections officer from a certain distance. Now the question would become: How many people who do that will still be able to smuggle in contraband?",
  "I don't think you're really arguing for a -- an individualized reasonable suspicion standard. I think you're arguing for a rule that draws distinctions based on categories that correspond only perhaps very roughly to reasonable suspicion.",
  "I mean, all of this is theoretically interesting, and it may be that capital cases are sui generis here. But I thought the heart of your argument was that there just is no way to unscramble the eggs in this situation; there is no - - and that was your third point, and I understood it.",
  "There is no remedy that can put the parties back into the position where they would have been had the error regarding the legal issue not occurred.",
  "No, the Court has said - -",
  "The Court has said that death is different. And did you think it is inconceivable that there could be a different rule for capital cases, such as a rule requiring that, in a capital case, any offer of a noncapital sentence as part of a plea bargain actually be waived by the defendant in court so that this doesn't come up? This is not a capital case.",
  "The relief that you want is specific performance of the plea bargain.",
  "Isn't that correct? What if it had come to light or come to the prosecutor's attention during this intervening time that your client had committed four or five other shootings? Would you still be entitled to specific performance?",
  "I mean, that's pretty incredible. It doesn't matter what the defendant has done in the -- has been discovered to have done in the interim? Committed 5 murders, 10 murders?",
  "Wipe it out of your mind; you get -- you get the plea bargain that was offered at an early point in -- in the investigation of the case?",
  "Well, I don't know if that's going to be so - -",
  "I don't know that that's going to be so hard to show. Do you think it's feasible to draw a distinction between this case, where there was arguably inaccurate legal advice, and the case in which the defense attorney simply makes a terribly mistaken calculation about the chances of a favorable verdict at trial? A favorable plea bargain is offered, caps the guy's possible sentence at, let's say, 3 years. The defense attorney says: We've got a great shot at an acquittal. Let's go to trial. I'm going to rip the prosecution's witnesses apart. The trial turns out to be a disaster. Convicted on all counts, 25 years. Do you think that it's impossible for the rule that you want us to adopt here to be applied in that situation as well?",
  "You have a situation where the -- where the defendant turns down -- where a plea is turned down and the defendant goes to trial. Are there any facts in -- any facts that would make any remedy other than specific performance the correct remedy in that situation?",
  "You recommend -- you recommend specific performance as the remedy for your case, and I agree with you that is -- if there is to be a remedy, it's the only remedy that makes a -- any modicum of sense. The remedy of giving a new trial when the person has already had a fair trial makes zero sense.",
  "So, what I'm looking for is any situation in which -- you said leave it to the discretion of the trial judge. But what is -- what discretion is there? What remedy in that situation other than specific performance would be an appropriate -- would remedy what you claim to have been the violation?",
  "Do you think the length and the complexity of the trial has any bearing on this? This was a relatively short and simple trial. But let's say a prosecutor offers a plea deal in a case in which the trial is going to take 6 months and it's going to cost -- and it's going to cost a million dollars, and if they try that case, there are going to be other cases that they won't be able to try. The plea is rejected, the case is tried, and then afterwards the -- the remedy is to -- to -- to reinstate this plea offer, which was predicated on the relieving the prosecutor of the burden of having to try that case.",
  "I'm really puzzled by what as a practical matter is at stake in this case. Under the State court decision, the defendant has the option of either pleading guilty to the charge, in which case he will be right back where he is now, or he can insist on a trial. And if he insists on a trial, you need to prove that he was driving with a revoked license. That seems to me -- if there ever was a slam-dunk trial, that seems to me that's the slam-dunk trial. You introduce the records of -- showing that his license was revoked, and you have the officer testify on such and such a date he was driving. So, I don't really see what is involved in this case.",
  "I don't see what is at stake here. I don't see what that -- as a practical matter, this seems to be -- to me to be a case about nothing. Am I wrong? Am I missing something?",
  "Suppose he had snapped up this deal as soon as it was offered. By the time he appeared before the court to answer a formal plea of guilty, would the court have known that he had in the interim been arrested yet again for driving without a license?",
  "Suppose he had been told that -- suppose he had been told that, and the prosecutor said, well, yes, that's true; I made that offer, but it's off the table now. And apparently, this was then off the table. So, what good would it have done him to know about something that happened in the past but was no longer available?",
  "No, I understand that, and it may have been unfair, but I don't see why it's involuntary. Because I don't see that -- advising him that he had an option at some point in the past which was no longer available really doesn't have much of a - - doesn't have any bearing on the voluntariness of his plea to a later less-favorable offer.",
  "Well, in the case -- where the case goes to trial, prejudice isn't going to be very hard to prove. The person turned down a 5-year deal and gets -- and after trial is sentenced to 20 years. So, you've got -- you're got prejudice right there, right?",
  "So, there's always going to be a very good argument for prejudice where a person turns down a favorable deal and then gets slammed after a trial.",
  "No, but the point is just that -- I'm sorry.",
  "The point is just that prejudice isn't going to be very tough to show, is it? You turned down a 1-year deal, and then later when that was off the table, you accepted a 5-year deal.",
  "There's prejudice - -",
  "On the issue of - -",
  "On the issue of remedy, as the Respondent are you not limited to the remedies that were provided in the judgment of the State court?",
  "Well, you didn't file a cross-petition, and there wasn't one granted. So, aren't -- aren't you limited to defending the judgment below? Can you ask for a modification of the judgment below in your favor?",
  "You think that because we added a question, that acts as the functional equivalent of a granted cross-petition that would permit modification of the judgment in your favor?",
  "To get back to the question that Justice Ginsburg asked, is it -- is that consistent with Carlson? Because the Court in Carlson didn't say that there's a Bivens action because in this particular State there isn't a viable State action, but it might be different in another State where there is a viable State claim. It did it on basically a categorical ground.",
  "Does a prisoner in a State that requires the filing of a certificate of merit in a medical malpractice case have a -- have an alternative -- a viable alternative State claim - -",
  "-- for malpractice?",
  "Under the PLRA -- under the PLRA, a district judge has to perform a screening function for -- for these complaints, and is that -- is it going to be an impossible burden for district judges to ascertain the contours of State prison law, in that there apparently is not a lot of prisoner litigation under State law? Most prisoners seem to choose 1983.",
  "What would you propose that the Court say about the degree of adequate State remedy that is necessary? Just -- what we have here in California is enough and not go any further or - -",
  "Suppose that a State did for claims against private prisons and private prison guards what I understand New York has done with respect to State-run prisons; in other words, that you eliminate any claim against individual prison employees or guards and give the prisoner just a tort claim against the State. Would that be adequate?",
  "Not a claim against the State. I misspoke. A claim -- only a claim against the company that runs the prison.",
  "The problem I have with your argument is that I don't really know what a complaining witness is in the grand jury context. Let's take the Federal grand jury as an example. Do you think there are complaining witnesses before Federal grand juries?",
  "A complaining witness, I would think, is a person who files a complaint, who causes -- so, under the Federal system, it would be someone who files a complaint and attests to it under Rule 5. That person is asking that charges be brought. That's what it means to be a complaining witness, filing a complaint. Nobody -- no witness before a Federal grand jury asks that an indictment be returned. They provide testimony, and they may want an indictment to be returned, but it's the prosecutor who asks for the indictment to be returned. So, I don't see how there is a complaining witness in that sense in the traditional grand jury context.",
  "Well, let me give you another example that I think happens with some frequency. You have a Federal grand jury, and you have testimony by an FBI or a DEA case agent, the person who has been working on the case, and that witness provides a lot of information supporting the charges that the prosecutor wants returned. You also have a cooperating witness, someone who has entered into a plea bargain and, in exchange for that, is providing a lot of incriminating testimony. Now, is there a complaining witness in that situation?",
  "Which one is it?",
  "Both?",
  "The holding that you're asking for isn't going to do very much good if the -- if the mere issuance of the grand jury subpoena renders the person not a complaining witness.",
  "In that situation, then why not subpoena everybody?",
  "But you said that the issuance of a subpoena in itself is not sufficient to make somebody not a complaining witness. So, if you are issued a subpoena, you still might be a complaining witness if you really didn't need to get a subpoena. If you could have been persuaded to go without a subpoena, then maybe you're -- you could be a complaining witness.",
  "I mean, somebody gets mugged - -",
  "And at common law, did any grand jury witnesses have absolute immunity from a claim for malicious prosecution?",
  "Well, could there be - -",
  "And could there be malicious prosecution liability for a witness before a grand jury who was not a, quote/unquote, \"complaining witness\"?",
  "So, you're not really asking us to adopt the common law rule, are you? You're asking for a variation of the common law rule that's limited to complaining witnesses. Or are you going further? Are you saying that no witness before a grand jury should have absolute immunity from a so-called 1983 malicious prosecution claim?",
  "So, if I understand your answer, that you're not -- it's -- this whole business about complaining witness is irrelevant. It's any -- no witness before a grand jury has absolute immunity.",
  "Any witness could -- who would satisfy the elements of the malicious prosecution tort could be liable?",
  "All right. That's a little different, isn't it?",
  "I have the same -- I have the same concern as Justice Breyer. And let me try to ask the question in a different way. Can you give me an example of a case in which someone would qualify as a complaining witness under Mr. Pincus's definition and yet would not have done something outside of the grand jury that would be sufficient to make out a claim of malicious prosecution? If that situation doesn't exist, then I don't see any difference between your position and Mr. Pincus's position.",
  "Paragraph 29 of the complaint alleges Mr. Paulk and Mr. Hodges, acting under color of law, in retaliation and wrongfully influenced and instigated the prosecutorial decision to bring charges against Mr. Rehberg. Why isn't that sufficient to support a claim of so-called malicious prosecution without regard to the evidentiary -- without regard to the grand jury testimony?",
  "Well, suppose this was a jurisdiction that didn't have grand juries but returned felony indictments by means of a preliminary hearing. Would a witness at a preliminary hearing have absolute immunity? There's a judge presiding there.",
  "Are those -- are those cases involving grand jury proceedings like the one here, which does look somewhat like the complaint situation? Or are they more traditional grand jury settings?",
  "Well, under Justice --",
  "Suppose the Petitioner asks for a certificate of appealability on 10 issues, and the circuit judge says, I'm granting it on issue 1, I'm denying it on issue 2 through 9 -- 2 through 10. Is there jurisdiction to consider 2 through 10?",
  "No, in that situation then, if the State moves to dismiss the arguments that are made by Petitioner on issues 2 through 10, would the -- would the panel be obligated to do that?",
  "It could do that without issuing a new -- without issuing a certificate of appealability, without saying we think that the judge who issued the certificate of appealability was incorrect, that jurists of reason could disagree on issues 2 through 10?",
  "But is it necessary for you to go -- is it necessary for you to go as far as you seem to be going? Would it be possible to read (c)(3) as mandatory but not jurisdictional?",
  "So that if -- well, I understood what you just -- your argument to be that it doesn't even have any effect, that so long as there's any document that's called a certificate of appealability, then anything can be considered by the court of appeals panel without the issuance of a -- of a certificate of appealability covering the issue. But if it's mandatory but not jurisdictional, then if the State moves or maybe if the court, if the panel, sue sponte identifies the fact that there may be an error, there's an opportunity for a new certificate of appealability. If nothing is done, then -- then there isn't a problem. It's not a jurisdictional issue that lingers forever.",
  "So, if the panel looks at the merits of the constitutional issue as to which there is a reference in the certificate of appealability, when it -- when it writes its opinion it first has to ask itself, was there a substantial showing? And if there wasn't, then it will say we'll dismiss this claim. And then -- but if it says, well, there was a substantial showing, but it's wrong, then we'll affirm. Is that -- is that right?",
  "You're saying 99 percent of the -- of the defendants who take an appeal through the Texas system don't file a petition with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals? Or is it 99 percent of those who don't do that and then file a Federal habeas petition? I would imagine it's the former, right?",
  "Yes.",
  "I take it from your -- I take it from your answers that simple unreliability is not enough. If there's testimony - -",
  "-- eyewitness testimony that seems of very dubious unreliability, that cannot be excluded.",
  "At least not on that ground.",
  "Something more is needed; suggestiveness is needed.",
  "But suggestiveness doesn't require any police involvement? Is that right?",
  "Can you just define what you mean by \"suggestiveness\"?",
  "Yes, but those are all situations where the police is involved -- the police are involved.",
  "Well, what if you have cross-racial identification? Would that qualify on the ground that studies have shown that those may be less reliable?",
  "I understand that, but I need to know what you mean by \"suggestiveness.\" What does that mean? Can you just give me a definition of it?",
  "But that would be really a great change from the way trials are now conducted, wouldn't it? Let me give you this example: A victim is raped, and the victim doesn't really have a very good opportunity to see the perpetrator. It's dark, the person has a mask and so forth. A couple of weeks go by, and the victim reads on article in the paper that says so-and-so has been arrested for a rape in another part of the city. There's a picture of that person in the paper. And the victim says that's the person who - - who raped me. Now, you want to make it possible for the judge to say to the -- that victim may not testify and identify the person -- that that person -- that the victim says was the perpetrator of the rape, on the ground that the newspaper picture was suggestive, even though there wasn't any police involvement, and when you look at all the circumstances, the identification is unreliable. Now, maybe that's a good system, but that is a drastic change, is it not, from the way criminal trials are now conducted?",
  "Do you know of cases like that in which the judge has said that eyewitness identification cannot come in?",
  "What you seem to -- what you're saying -- what you're saying seems to suggest that the rule we're talking about here is really not an aspect of due process per se, but, like the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, it's a special due process exclusionary rule that is meant to deter conduct that could result in a constitutional violation. Is that right?",
  "If -- if the exclusionary aspect of this is not part of due process itself, then doesn't it follow that what due process requires is reliability? So, doesn't that mean that -- that the Petitioner's argument is correct, the due process standard is simply reliability, not suggestiveness?",
  "You have two cases. You have Mr. Perry's case; then you have another case that's very similar. In fact, it's identical, except that in that instance the police officer talking to the witness said, would you take a look out the window and see if you recognize anybody? Now, from the perspective of the defendants, the cases are -- seem -- as far as whether they get a fair trial, the cases are identical; are they not? The evidence is the same. The suggestiveness is the same.",
  "I was intrigued by what your brief said about Federal Rule of Evidence 403. Do you think that a Federal judge under that rule may exclude the testimony of a witness on the ground that the witness is, in the judgment of the trial judge, completely unbelievable?",
  "But you think in theory that could be done? So, if you put on a cooperating witness in the case and this witness has made a hundred inconsistent statements previously and has been convicted of perjury, that the judge could just say you can't put that witness on because that person is -- is a liar, and I'm not going to have the witness testify in my courtroom?",
  "There surely is some minimal due process requirement for the admission of evidence, isn't there? Are you saying there is none? If a State abolished the hearsay rule, could it -- would it not be a violation of due process if the prosecution introduced quadruple hearsay?",
  "All right. Let me give - - you're right. Let me give you another example. Let's say you have -- the State puts on a witness who -- who says this person did it because I saw it in my crystal ball.",
  "But do you think -­",
  "Do you think it's relevant that the title of section 214 is \"United States Policy With Respect to Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel\"?",
  "Are you suggesting -­",
  "But are you suggesting Congress enacted this because they thought that if these individuals' passports simply said \"Jerusalem,\" there would be an identification problem?",
  "Has there ever been an instance in which the President has recognized a foreign government over Congress's sustained objection?",
  "Well, doesn't it depend on what the question is? In order to decide whether it's a political question, you have to identify the question. Now, if the question is whether the President has exclusive authority with respect to the formal recognition of a foreign country, that might be one thing. But what if the question is whether the President has exclusive jurisdiction with respect -- has plenary authority, unreviewable authority, with respect to anything that the President thinks has a bearing on the question of recognition. Now, if that's the question, is that committed exclusively to the President?",
  "There are many things that Congress could do to frustrate the President's decision to recognize another country. Now, would you say all of those are unconstitutional? They all infringe the President's exclusive recognition authority? Suppose the President decides to recognize a country, and Congress refuses to appropriate any money for an embassy there or refuses to confirm any U.S. ambassador to that country. Those presumably would not be unconstitutional, would they?",
  "Do you think that's an exclusive power, to -- to determine of the contents of passports? Hasn't Congress exercised that authority -­",
  "-- for a long time.",
  "Well, that seems to get - - to me to get to what's really involved here. The issue of whether there's a technical trespass or not is potentially a ground for deciding this particular case, but it seems to me the heart of the problem that's presented by this case and will be presented by other cases involving new technology is that in the pre-computer, pre-Internet age, much of the privacy -- I would say most of the privacy -- that people enjoyed was not the result of legal protections or constitutional protections; it was the result simply of the difficulty of traveling around and gathering up information. But with computers, it's now so simple to amass an enormous amount of information about people that consists of things that could have been observed on the streets, information that was made available to the public. If -- if this case is decided on the ground that there was a technical trespass, I don't have much doubt that in the near future, it will be possible -- I think it's possible now in many instances -- for law enforcement to monitor people's movements on -- on public streets without committing a technical trespass. So, how do we deal with this? Do we just say, well, nothing is changed, so that all the information that people expose to the public is -- is fair game? There's no -- there's no search or seizure when that is -- when that is obtained because there isn't a reasonable expectation of privacy, but isn't there a real change in -- in this regard?",
  "What is the size of this device?",
  "What is the size of this device?",
  "And what if it was put on the license place? Would that be a technical trespass? Is that the property of the driver?",
  "Well, where would you draw the line? Suppose that the GPS was used only to track somebody's movements for 1 day or for 12 hours or for 3 hours. Would that be all right?",
  "Put aside -- put aside the trespass question.",
  "Well, that sounds like a legislative line. But what is the difference between following somebody for 12 hours, let's say, and monitoring their movements on a GPS for 12 hours? You would say that the latter -- your first argument is there's a problem with the latter but not with the former. But what would the reason for that be?",
  "There's no more -- what - - what is the difference in terms of one's privacy whether you're followed by a police officer for 12 hours and you don't see the officer or whether you're monitored by GPS for 12 hours?",
  "You know, I don't know what society expects, and I think it's changing. Technology is changing people's expectations of privacy. Suppose we look forward 10 years, and maybe 10 years from now 90 percent of the population will be using social networking sites, and they will have on average 500 friends, and they will have allowed their friends to monitor their location 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, through the use of their cell phones. Then -- what would the expectation of privacy be then?",
  "Well, that -- maybe that's a good way to decide the case. But I just wonder, would Mr. Jones or anybody else be really upset if they found that the police had sneaked up to their car and put an inert device the size of a credit card on the underside of the car? What would they say about that, other than the fact that the police are wasting money doing this?",
  "You don't even see it. It's just a little wafer. They put it under the car. It does nothing.",
  "No, but this one does nothing, and you -- so you would go -- you would sue - - you would bring a trespass action.",
  "So, what's you're concerned about is not this little thing that's put on your car. It's not this invasion of your property interest. It's the monitoring that takes place.",
  "There was a warrant -- there was a warrant in this case. This is a puzzling aspect of the case to me, and maybe there -- it's irrelevant for present purposes. There was a warrant, and the two violations are violations of a statute and a rule, neither of which may carry an exclusionary rule sanction with them or an exclusionary rule penalty with them. It's not clear at all that there was a violation of the Fourth Amendment. So, it's a little strange that we're deciding whether a warrantless search here would have been unconstitutional, when there was a warrant.",
  "No, that's not my point. The point is that the violation of the 10-day rule and the violation of the statutory prohibition on -- or maybe it's in the rule -- the prohibition on the judge in the District ordering the installation only in the District are not Fourth Amendment requirements.",
  "It is not a warrantless intrusion; there was a warrant.",
  "I think if you look at the lower court case law, you will find that a violation of the 10-day rule is not necessarily a violation of the Fourth Amendment. And - -",
  "-- it doesn't vitiate the warrant. The warrant doesn't necessarily dissolve or evaporate when the 10 days expire.",
  "Maybe those cases are wrong.",
  "Well, aren't you exaggerating a little bit about the value of the impeachment evidence regarding Boatner? Now, my understanding is that he made his first statement to the effect that he couldn't identify anybody at the scene when he had been at the scene where five people that he knew very well had been killed. He was lying on the floor with a big gash on his head. He was questioned at the scene, and at that time -- and this was in the evening -- he said: I can't identify anybody. But then, later that very day, wasn't it, that very evening, after midnight, he was questioned at the police station; am I correct?",
  "And at that point he gave a description. He did make an -- he did provide a description of the person that he said was the one who first came through the door. So, you know, that -- I don't know -- and then later, he said he -- there were statements to the effect that he couldn't identify anybody. But in light of the fact that he did provide a pretty, you know, somewhat detailed description on the very evening of the event, doesn't that -- aren't you exaggerating when you say that he said numerous times - - the effect of these statements that he couldn't identify - -",
  "That may be true, but if you were a juror and Boatner testified and he was cross-examined and they attempted to impeach him based on his failure to make an identification right at the scene, and he said, well, that was because five of my friends had just been killed and I was lying on the floor and I thought I was going to be shot too and I had a big gash on my head, and then a couple of hours later when I collected myself and they asked me the same question at the police station, I provided a description and didn't say I couldn't identify anybody -- do you think jurors would just dismiss that and say, well, he couldn't identify him at the scene so he must have been lying when he identified -- when he provided a description later at the police station?",
  "Does the defense have any theory as to why Boatner would lie about whether he could identify this individual?",
  "But, yes -- but the -- the impact of your impeachment evidence would be related certainly to if a juror would ask, well, why would he lie about this? And I -- I'm just asking, would -- did the defense have any theory about what his motive would be about whether he could identify somebody, whether this first person had a mask or not?",
  "But the first time he -- he said that the person wasn't masked and provided a description was long before he saw any mug shots. It was the evening of the event. It was when he was questioned at the police station.",
  "Yes, but by doing that he's saying this person wasn't wearing a mask. That's the critical point.",
  "Well, on that point, the State says that you're drawing a meaningless distinction between a hand -- a 9-millimeter handgun and a 9-millimeter automatic pistol.",
  "Well, can you explain how this -- how this took place? You have a case in which you're -- you're relying almost entirely on the testimony of one witness, and you have these notes that were taken by, and are presumably in the possession of, the lead investigator. Wouldn't any prosecutor ask the lead -- the lead investigator, do you have any statements of this witness?",
  "They have to be examined, and if there's anything in them that's -- that is impeachment material, they have to be turned over to the defense. And under Louisiana law, is there are a rule that requires the turning over of statements by witnesses, prior statements by witnesses?",
  "Where's that reflected in the record? I - -",
  "What you said in your brief was that the judge determined that the supplemental report relating to the North Roman Street murders contains no Brady material.",
  "I didn't understand the record to be that all of Boatner's statements -- that all the statements of Boatner that we're concerned about now were examined by the judge before- -",
  "-- trial?",
  "And the record reflects that where?",
  "It is your understanding that the -- that all of Boatner's -- all the notes about Boatner's statements were turned over to the judge before trial for in camera inspection?",
  "And what's that definition?",
  "So, the Seventh Circuit and -- and I forget what the other circuit was -- were incorrect in saying that the -- that the State could prohibit the slaughter of horses?",
  "Well, doesn't it seem strange to hold that the Federal Meat Inspection Act speaks to an issue like that? This doesn't have anything -- whether or not horses should be slaughtered and sold and their meat should be sold doesn't have anything to do with food safety, does it? And it doesn't have anything to do with humane treatment, assuming the same methods of slaughter are used?",
  "No, I wasn't speaking of the California law. I was speaking of the law that prohibits the -- the slaughter of horses - -",
  "That's based just on a judgment, a societal judgment, that this is an animal that should not be slaughtered and sold for food. What does that have to do with any of the purposes of the Federal Meat Inspection Act?",
  "Well, isn't it the case that most nonambulatory animals become nonambulatory because of the method of transportation that's used? Do you dispute the statistics in the brief of the non-State Respondent that -- Respondents that, nationwide, approximately 220,000 swine die during transport, another 440,000 become nonambulatory during the transportation process?",
  "Do you dispute the fact that the reason -- that ranchers generally do not ship animals that are nonambulatory at the time when the trip begins, but that most of these nonambulatory animals become nonambulatory during the transportation process?",
  "And you think it's difficult to identify which animals are nonambulatory? That's the difference between horses -- between prohibiting the slaughter of horses, because you can tell whether it's a horse or a pig, but you can't tell whether a pig can walk?",
  "Well, if they do it at the weigh station that a truck has to stop at when it enters the State, that would be okay?",
  "Well, before you get to that point, the animal has to be transported. Does Federal law regulate for humane purposes the transportation of animals to slaughterhouses?",
  "Well, if the Federal -- if Congress has not chosen to regulate the transportation of animals to prevent inhumane treatment in transit, why should a State law that aims at that objective be pre-empted?",
  "Well, if the State could inspect the trucks at a weigh station before they get to the slaughterhouse, why can't they do the same thing when they get to the slaughterhouse, where it's more practical to do that?",
  "Do you dispute -- you dispute that?",
  "Can Congress create a cause of action that does not arise under Federal law?",
  "And there's no dispute that there is a cause of action here that was created by Congress; isn't that right?",
  "Well, if the State thought that its courts were just being overwhelmed by these cases, even the small claims courts, there were so many of them, would they be permitted to bar them completely?",
  "You -- you seem to be arguing for a three-tier standard for displacing jurisdiction. So, if Congress wants to make a Federal claim cognizable only in Federal court, it has to be very, very clear. If it wants to displace diversity jurisdiction, it doesn't have to be that clear, but maybe it has to be certain -- clear to a certain degree. If it wants to displace Federal question jurisdiction, it doesn't have to be nearly as clear.",
  "Well, what --",
  "Wouldn't that be the oddest creature that's ever been seen, a cause of action created by Congress that is not a claim arising under Federal law? That's what you'd be saying.",
  "Could I ask you to clarify something? What could a plaintiff who purchases title insurance in Ohio allege that would be sufficient to provide standing?",
  "No, what could be done -- okay. Go ahead.",
  "So, you could -- the plaintiff could allege some kind defective service at the time when the title insurance was purchased? There really is no service provided at that time, is there?",
  "You get -- you get a title insurance policy and that's it; and you don't know whether -- you don't know what will happen if there's some problem alleged with the title at some point down the road.",
  "And if the plaintiff went any further and alleged some harm particular to her, wouldn't that be even more speculative?",
  "Some economic harm particular to her? I don't want to take up your rebuttal time, but --",
  "Well, this is where I have problems with your argument, because this doesn't seem to me to be a fiduciary relationship, and I don't see where the -- where the duty of loyalty comes from. And to say that Congress can just impose some attributes of a fiduciary relationship wherever it wants seems rather strange. Let me give you this example: I take my car to an auto dealer to have -- because it's making a strange sound. And I say call me up when you figure out what you think is the problem. They call me up, and they say, well, there are certain things wrong with it, and it's going to cost you $1,000. And I say, okay, now, thanks for diagnosing the problem; where should I have it fixed? Should I have it fixed at your shop or should I go to another place and have it fixed? And they say, well, have it fixed at our shop. Now, is there a breach of a duty of loyalty there?",
  "I know. But we're looking for whether there's an injury-in-fact. Put aside the question of whether there's a breach of the duty in law. There is allegedly here. I just don't see where there's an injury-in-fact, because I know -- I'm an idiot if I don't realize -- that they have a strong economic incentive to say come have it fixed at my place.",
  "Would there be injury-in-fact if the plaintiff knew everything that was relevant to this -- was an economist who had studied the effect of these things on title insurance price and quality and, in fact, had -- was aware of every single transaction that had ever occurred between the title insurance company and the title agent? Would there be injury-in-fact in that situation?",
  "Nevertheless said, okay, I understand this is what I'm getting into, but I'm going ahead.",
  "There would be injury-in-fact?",
  "Is that -- is that true? If we were to look at all the statutes of limitations in the -- in the U.S. Code, we would find that they are generally or exclusively drafted like section 1658, the general statute of limitations provisions, and are geared to or are triggered by the accrual of the action rather than some event?",
  "Before you turn away from the statute of repose, could I just ask you one more question --",
  "-- on -- on that? If -- if 16(a) reports are not filed, how likely is it that a potential 16(b) plaintiff will find out within the 2-year period that there were these trades?",
  "What would -- what are the other filings that might disclose this?",
  "Well, if you were drafting a statute of repose, how would you phrase it other than the way this is phrased?",
  "Before you get to that, do you have an example of a -- a classic statute of repose that I could look at to see how they should be phrased, and not one that says that there shall be tolling -- there shall not be tolling except in some circumstances, one that just says this is it; no tolling whatsoever?",
  "Right. Right.",
  "A stand-alone provision.",
  "Well, no. Why is that true? Somebody could be a -- an insider without knowing that the person was an insider.",
  "No, I understand that, but I thought the point was -- I thought the question was whether there is the kind of concealment that would invoke equitable tolling when the concealment is not done knowingly, when it is not done in -- in knowing breach of a disclosure obligation.",
  "Well, what about as a matter of language, whether or not 16(b) is a -- whether it's a statute of repose or a statute of limitations, it tells you exactly when the time is supposed to begin to run, from the -- from the realization of the profit? And you want to say no, it doesn't begin to run from that point; it begins to run from the point when some other completely different external event occurs, if it ever does occur, which is the filing of the 16(a) report. Textually, how do you get to that?",
  "And it requires actual -- is that right? It requires actual knowledge on the part of the plaintiff?",
  "Does that make any sense, given the -- the class of individuals who are plaintiffs in 16(b) cases?",
  "Somebody who -- who is found for purposes of litigation very often to have purchased his stock long after all of this takes place. So, the lawyer who wants to bring this suit can just go out and find somebody who knows nothing? Isn't that right?",
  "And who would file the State tax return? Would it be filed by the estate or would it be filed by the debtor?",
  "But it's not just Senator Grassley. Your interpretation makes this provision, 1222(a)(2)(A), of very, very little practical value. And you think that's what Congress intended? Not only would it -- would it mean that postpetition capital gains on the sale of part of the farm or the entire farm would -- would be outside of the bankruptcy, outside of the bankruptcy, but all of the prepetition capital gains would be outside of it too, unless they occurred in a previous taxable year.",
  "Could I ask you this question about the damages that your client is seeking in this case? If -- if we affirm the Ninth Circuit, would -- are you claiming all of the damages that -- all of the emotional damages that resulted from his criminal conviction, or are you claiming only the emotional damages that would have been suffered by anybody else whose records were turned over to the FAA under the Operation Safe Pilot program?",
  "Well, you allege that Mr. Cooper suffered a severe emotional distress when he was confronted with the fact that his records had been turned over. So, you're -- you're saying that the court -- that on remand, there would have to be a separation of the degree of distress that he suffered as a result of simply knowing that somebody in the FAA had access to his Social Security records, but disregard the distress that somebody in that situation would naturally feel when confronted with the fact that a criminal violation that he had committed had been exposed?",
  "But you agree that the Act does not allow recovery for what would have been regarded at common law as general damages?",
  "\"General damages\" -- that's the term that they peeled off, right?",
  "But general damages is a term from -- from the remedies in defamation cases, right?",
  "And there are two types of damages in defamation cases, special damages and general damages? And if you -- is that correct?",
  "So, you subtract general damages, and what do you have left?",
  "But the problem is that -- that your definition of actual damages and the general definition of actual damages includes some things that fell within the rubric of general damages.",
  "Well, let me just try this one more time. You -- you say that there's a right to recover actual damages but no right to recover general damages. So, what you think is recoverable is actual damages minus general damages?",
  "No?",
  "Well, suppose this were a common lawsuit for -- for slander per quod, and what was said was that Mr. Cooper received Social Security disability benefits. Now, he would -- and he claims that causes him great distress because of the extrinsic fact that he was known to be a pilot, and, therefore, people who -- who knew that he was flying around an airplane even though he was so severely disabled that he was entitled to get Social Security disability benefits -- that would damage his reputation. Now, the damages that you're seeking, the emotional distress that he allegedly incurred, what would that be? Which -- under what category of damages would that fall?",
  "And let's --",
  "You don't claim any economic loss here.",
  "No. That -- under the -- would that be the term that a court -- a common law court would use, actual damages? Wouldn't they ask whether the damages to his reputation and the emotional distress that he suffered therefrom were either -- wouldn't they ask whether that was special or general?",
  "No. Gertz came after the common law. Gertz was a modification of the common law. What would it be at common law?",
  "General damages here are excluded by Congress, right?",
  "And this is --",
  "In situations like this, somebody is going to have to make the decision whether the Federal sentence and the subsequently imposed State sentence run concurrently or consecutively. And now you're arguing that that should be done by the Bureau of Prisons. Do you think in general that is better for defendants than a rule that would allow the sentencing judge in Federal court to make that determination?",
  "Why would the -- why would the exact length of the sentence imposed by the State court be relevant to the determination made by the sentencing judge? I thought the sentencing judge's reasoning was that the -- the undischarged term of imprisonment that was going to be imposed on the offense for which probation had previously been granted and there had been a violation of the probation, that that had nothing to do with his subsequent Federal drug charges, and, therefore, the Federal drug charges should run consecutively to that but should be concurrent to any sentence imposed by the State court on the State drug charges. What -- you know, what's wrong with that reasoning, and what additional insight relevant to that reasoning would be obtained by waiting until after the sentence was imposed?",
  "Well, that's interesting.",
  "Do you think that the Bureau of Prisons is bound by those factors when they make the decision later?",
  "It seems to me that the question of how long someone should spend in prison, which is what's involved in determining whether -- deciding whether a sentence is going to be served consecutively or concurrently, is very different from determining where the sentence is going to be -- where a sentence is going to be served. Isn't this a very strange reading of -- of 3621, to say that that grants the BOP the authority to make this concurrent/consecutive determination?",
  "This is perhaps something that I should have asked the Solicitor General, but do you have any idea how often this situation comes up?",
  "Well, in order for you to prevail, I think we -- is it correct, we would have to determine that there was this authority inherent in the judiciary prior to the enactment of this statute?",
  "Yes, with respect to Federal sentences, certainly that's true. But with respect to Federal and State sentences, it may be, as you suggested, that this just didn't come up very often until the enactment probably of the Federal drug laws and -- and a few other statutes that created offenses where you have -- where the same conduct would constitute a violation of both Federal and State law. And so, you have this situation coming up with greater frequency.",
  "There's something --",
  "There's something very strange about the rule that we are applying here. A warrant was issued by a judge of the superior court; isn't that right?",
  "And we're -- so, that judge, who is a lawyer and was appointed as a judge and presumably has some familiarity with the Fourth Amendment, found that there was probable cause to search for all of these things. And now we're asking whether a reasonable police officer who is not a lawyer and certainly is not a judge should have been able to see that this call that was made by a judge was not only wrong but so wrong that it -- you couldn't reasonably think that the judge might be correct. Is there some way to phrase this -- if this rule is to be retained in any form, is there some way to phrase it so that it is narrowed appropriately?",
  "Now, is it the case here that a reasonably well-trained officer would not -- would understand that this warrant was defective in authorizing a search for guns other than the shotgun in question, when a provision of the California Penal Code says that a search warrant may be issued to seize items intended for use in committing a crime?",
  "Well, you have your client who has discharged a sawed-off shotgun at his former girlfriend in an attempt to kill her. And he -- he is known to be a member of a violent gang, and he has threatened to kill her. And so, a reasonable police officer would -- could not think, well, he might have some other guns, and he -- and there would be an intent to use those in the commission of the crime that he has threatened to commit.",
  "I'm sorry. Excuse me. Mr. Bowen --",
  "Well, that was just -- that was a misstatement on my part.",
  "They could not think that about Mr. Bowen?",
  "But the -- all right. It was found that there was probable cause to believe that he was living in these premises; isn't that correct? And you're not contesting that.",
  "You're not -- it's not an issue before us.",
  "Well, on the assumption that he was living in those premises, then what is wrong with a reasonable officer thinking he's tried to kill her in the past using one gun; he's a member of a gang; he is very likely to have -- to possess or have access to other guns; those other guns may be found in the home where we believe he is living, and he is intending to use them to carry out the threat that he has promised, the threat that he has made?",
  "What's to the gang paraphernalia? Why couldn't an officer reasonably believe that there was a probable cause to seize that -- to search for and seize that, because it would link Mr. Bowen with this residence where they hoped to find the shotgun? And you dispute the fact that he is -- that he is associated with that residence.",
  "And why couldn't a reasonable officer think that that would be the case here?",
  "No, well, if they have probable cause to believe that the sawed-off shotgun is there -- let's suppose they find the sawed-off shotgun. Then there's going to be an issue at trial: Was it his sawed-off shotgun? And anything that links him to that residence is valuable evidence.",
  "I thought this was a test of what they could -- what a reasonable officer could have believed, not what they in particular believed.",
  "Well, to come back to a question that was asked before --",
  "-- suppose they were issuing -- suppose the warrant just sought this -- the -- that particular weapon. They execute it, and they come to a room in this house, and it's got Mr. Bowen's name on it, and inside there's a gun cabinet, and there are -- there are a whole -- there's a whole array of guns, legal -- let's say he legally possesses them. There's a -- there's a -- there are assault rifles. There are pistols. And it's known that he's threatened to kill his girlfriend. You say -- would the police be able to seize those?",
  "All right. All sorts of legal weapons --",
  "-- that could be used. Could they -- could they seize those?",
  "Let's --",
  "-- I'm hypothesizing --",
  "-- he has a license for all of these.",
  "He's not a felon.",
  "The circumstances are exactly the circumstances here --",
  "-- except for the two things that I changed. It's his room, and it's his gun cabinet.",
  "Well, let's say they don't find him. He's still at large. They have to leave the weapons there.",
  "When they leave. Why? On what ground could they seize them?",
  "It's his room. It's his room.",
  "They can't say, and we're going to take them under -- we're going to take them so that he can't use those to kill his girlfriend which is what he has threatened to do? They just have to leave them there --",
  "-- and if he happens to come back and -- and get those weapons, and he kills her, well, that's just too bad?",
  "You really -- you really are not answering my question.",
  "My question is: Everything is exactly the same except that it's his room and he's not a felon and he possesses them legally and there they are, and they see them.",
  "And your answer is they can take them. In which case, my question is, why wouldn't they have probable cause to search for those in the first place? Or they can't take them, in which case I say, well, what about the possibility that he will come back, get those weapons, and carry out his threat using those weapons?",
  "Suppose I said your brief does not cite a Supreme Court decision. Would that be a correct statement?",
  "Well, we have hundreds and hundreds, probably thousands, of opinions, and you didn't cite -- there were many of them that you didn't cite. You cited quite a few, but you didn't cite all of them.",
  "As I understand your argument, you satisfy -- the ground for seeking deletion or correction was satisfied even before Novo wrote the new use code that you claim is overly broad. When the use code said simply the use of repaglinide with metformin, the ground for seeking deletion or correction was satisfied, wasn't it?",
  "No, but that's another -- so, there are two oddities in the way you read the statute. And it may be Congress just did a bad job of drafting. But the first is the one we were discussing before, and that's the second one, that -- your -- your beef really is not that the patent does not include every use. Your beef is that the source -- the use code is too broad. And yet, that is not the ground that the statute sets out for seeking deletion or correction.",
  "Suppose you didn't file the -- suppose the counterclaim provision wasn't available, and Novo -- you filed a paragraph IV certification, and Novo sues you for infringement. Could you not defend the infringement action on the ground that your use of the -- of the drug was not in -- did not infringe their patent?",
  "Why -- why is that?",
  "If a patent holder --",
  "If a patent holder writes a use code that is ridiculously, totally, unreasonably broad, is there anything that FDA can do about that?",
  "Well, what about after --",
  "What about after there has been litigation and a court has decided that a use code that was written in a particular case was totally unreasonable? Does that -- does that mean that the writing of that was in violation of some provision of the -- of the Food and Drug Act or FDA regulations and that there would be some sanction against the company that did that?",
  "To come back to Justice Kagan's question, your position is really nothing can be done by a generic that is blocked from marketing a drug for a nonpatented use by a use code that -- that is -- that seems to cover that use.",
  "There has been some additional litigation regarding this physical evidence since this -- the time of the -- the unsuccessful substitution request; hasn't there been?",
  "Could you tell us what has happened with that?",
  "I'm sorry. Could you tell us what has happened with that litigation?",
  "That's what I was referring to.",
  "And what -- what has happened there? Was there -- was there testing of this evidence in connection with that?",
  "What about a -- a possible Brady claim? Is there a disagreement about whether this physical evidence could have been tested at the time and revealed anything at the time of the trial?",
  "What about an actual innocence claim?",
  "Well, that would be pretty incredible. Maybe that's what's required. Why isn't this is a fair reading of what Judge Taylor did? As of April 29th, as I recall, there was not a problem with the representation. And the decision was made on June the 30th. Now, on June the 16th, that's the time when Clair sent his letter. By this point, the petition had been pending for a long time before the judge. The judge presumably was approaching the point where he was going to issue his decision. He saw the letter. He could not see any way in which the matters that were discussed in the letters could lead to a claim that would go anywhere. As to the physical evidence, if it couldn't have been tested at the time of trial, there would not have been a Brady obligation, and an actual innocence claim here would be quite far-fetched in light of the very incriminating statements that -- that Mr. Clair made in the tape-recorded conversation. Had he substituted counsel, he would not have been under an obligation, I think, to allow substituted counsel to amend the petition, which had been pending for a long period of time. So, he said: Counsel is doing a proper job; there doesn't appear to be a conflict of interest; and I'm going to deny this. Now, counsel could have been appointed and, in fact, was appointed to represent Mr. Clair going forward. Why isn't that a fair reading of what he did? And if so, what need was there for further inquiry?",
  "But suppose the --",
  "But the interests of justice is such an open-ended test. If that is the test, doesn't it follow that it will only be in the rarest of cases that a district judge will have been found -- will be found to have abused his or her discretion in denying a substitution request? Why does that very broad standard help you here?",
  "Well, how does the fingerprint --",
  "I know you think there should be inquiry.",
  "But before your time runs out, how would the -- how would the fact that there were fingerprints at the scene that do not match anybody who was known to be in that house have provided evidence for -- provided the basis for any claim that could have established Mr. Clair's innocence at this late -- at this late date, in the face of the other evidence that was present in this case, the recorded statements?",
  "Well, suppose defense counsel had introduced at trial fingerprint evidence showing that 10 people were present at some point in that house and they weren't people who lived there. That's -- it's weak exculpatory evidence for the defendant at best that there were -- there were unknown people in the house. It might have been the cable guy. Who knows who they were? So, it doesn't help very much.",
  "Hasn't it long been accepted that experts may testify to the facts that form the basis for their opinions on the ground that when the experts go over those facts, they are not -- those -- that information is not being introduced to prove the truth of the matter asserted, that -- the truth of those underlying facts; only that those are the facts that the expert has relied on in reaching an opinion? And that has not been considered to be hearsay. Now, do you argue that those -- that that's incorrect? Those -- those statements cannot be testified to as an -- by an expert without their constituting either hearsay or testimony within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause?",
  "Well, let's say that -- let me put it this way: Let's say the expert -- people from the -- the expert testifies, I received the -- I looked at the report from -- from the lab; I looked at the report from -- I looked at the report from Cellmark, the outside lab; I looked at the report that we did; and there -- there is a match. And so, the expert is -- is mentioning facts that form the basis of the opinion but not testifying to the truth of those. Is that a violation of the Confrontation Clause at that point?",
  "Well, 10 isn't -- 10 is not a far-fetched hypothetical. We have an amicus brief from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office and the New York City Chief Medical Examiner's Office, and they say that their very fine crime lab involves at least 12 technicians in the analysis of DNA. They break it down that way because it increases accuracy; it decreases the chance of any favoritism for the prosecution. And they say that if -- it is impossible for us to bring all 12 of those technicians into court to testify in every case in which there is DNA evidence, and if we have to do that, we will just not be able to use DNA evidence in court. We will have to rely on less reliable evidence. Is that just a -- do you think that's just a practical consequence that we have to accept under Crawford?",
  "How will bringing in --",
  "How will bringing in one satisfy the Confrontation Clause problem? If 12 people perform steps in the analysis and 1 person testifies about what 11 other people did, don't you have the same Confrontation Clause problem?",
  "You don't?",
  "Well, why is that not a testimonial statement?",
  "If the -- if the person were in court, the person would say this is what I did.",
  "And that's not testimony?",
  "Well, what did the Illinois appellate court say about that, about whether the information was -- whether the evidence was admitted for the truth of the matter asserted?",
  "Isn't -- but isn't Justice Kagan's question there the correct question? Isn't that a question of Illinois evidence law, not a Federal constitutional question?",
  "Was there sufficient -- was a sufficient foundation laid for the introduction of the -- of the expert's testimony?",
  "That was -- that was addressed by the -- by the Illinois court?",
  "Well, there are two types of evidence that are -- that are involved here. One is chain of custody evidence. Was the result that was sent back the result that was done on the sample that was sent to Cellmark? That's just purely chain of custody. That has nothing whatsoever to do with the -- the accuracy or the professionalism of what was done at Cellmark. And she did make a statement. She did say that the sample -- that the result that came back from Cellmark was -- was done -- was based on a test of the vaginal swab that was sent there. The other has to do with what Cellmark did, how well they did it. She didn't say anything about that. Now, as to the chain of custody, if that's testimonial, isn't -- isn't it simply duplicative of the very strong circumstantial evidence regarding the chain of custody, the sending of it out with certain markings and the receipt back with certain markings?",
  "Under Rule 703 of the Illinois Rules of Evidence, are the facts that an -- that an expert takes into account in reaching his or her opinion introduced for the truth of the matter asserted?",
  "Can I ask you about your --",
  "Could I ask you about your argument that the correlations that were discovered and that are involved here are not natural phenomena because the thiopurine drugs are synthetic products of human ingenuity? I found that a little difficult to understand. Suppose someone discovers the level at which a human pollutant that's present in the atmosphere, in the air or the water, has an adverse effect on human health. Is that not a natural phenomenon?",
  "And that's a natural phenomenon.",
  "Yes, but if photosynthesis is induced by a lamp inside a building, then it's not a natural phenomenon?",
  "On the issue of whether we should look to the segments or to the river as a whole, what authorities can we consult? You rely heavily on U.S. v. Utah, and that certainly is a relevant precedent; but there's disagreement about what it means, and the only authority that I see that U.S. v. Utah cited was The Montello, which seems to cite nothing whatsoever. So, where do we -- is that the end of the trail? Is there anyplace else we can look?",
  "Well, all of this, I take it, derives from the rule that pre-exists -- pre-existed the adoption of the Constitution, that the sovereign owned the navigable rivers within its borders. Is there some body of common law that addresses this, that would shed some light on whether that means the whole river or it means segments?",
  "So, what -- what is the origin of the rule that the original 13 States owned the navigable rivers or parts of the rivers but not the parts that weren't. That was some feature of American colonial law?",
  "I don't see why --",
  "I don't see why portage is relevant at all. What's the basis for the rule that the sovereign owns the navigable rivers? I assume it's because they are viewed -- they were viewed as highways for transportation and commerce. And to the extent that there's an obstruction that cannot be traversed by a boat, then there isn't going to be any commerce or transportation along that area. Now, there might be an argument that the sovereign should own the land next to the river so that you could portage around it, but what -- what would be the justification for saying the sovereign owns the portion of the river that can't be traversed at all by boat? I just don't understand it.",
  "What do -- what do you understand to be the reason for the rule that the States own the navigable rivers?",
  "What do fishing and navigation have to do with -- for -- what does fishing have to do with navigability?",
  "Let me put it this way: Why -- why should -- why does the State own a navigable river but not a nonnavigable river?",
  "Yes, and if that's the reason --",
  "If that's the reason for the rule, than what is the justification for State ownership of a portion of the river that is not navigable?",
  "The rule that you're arguing for might be an established rule that we should follow, but as a matter of theory, I don't understand what the justification is for State ownership of a nonnavigable portion of the river if the reason for the underlying rule is so that people will not put up obstructions on the river so that they -- it can be maintained as an -- as an avenue of commerce. I can see that you -- why the State would own that, because otherwise riparian owners could put up fences and obstructions and charge tolls and -- and that sort of thing. But if it's not navigable, I don't see what it has to do with -- with commerce or transportation.",
  "The State can continue to regulate all those things whether or not it owns the bed.",
  "That seems very strange for that -- for a party to apply for a permit on -- on the ground that they don't need a permit at all. If you apply for a permit, is the Army Corps of Engineers going to decide whether you -- whether it's wetlands? Isn't it presupposed if you're applying for a permit that you -- you need one because there's -- they are wetlands?",
  "Given -- given the rather vague nature of the test that's been adopted for determining whether something is part of the waters of the United States, wouldn't you have a very difficult time showing that a determination that it was, was arbitrary and capricious?",
  "Has the - -",
  "Has the - -",
  "Has the United States adopted a rule or announced a policy that it will never seek anything more than the penalty for the underlying violation? It will not seek an additional penalty for violation of the compliance order?",
  "So, it's more than theoretical, then. I don't really understand what you're saying. You're saying that we may ask for more, but it's unlikely courts will actually provide for more.",
  "Well, Mr. Stewart, if you - - if you related the facts of this case as they come to us to an ordinary homeowner, don't you think most ordinary homeowners would say this kind of thing can't happen in the United States? You don't -- you buy property to build a house. You think maybe there's a little drainage problem in part of your lot. So, you start to build the house, and then you get an order from the EPA which says: You have filled in wetlands; so, you can't build your house. Remove the fill, put in all kinds of plants, and now you have to let us on your premises whenever we want to. You have to turn over to us all sorts of documents, and for every day that you don't do all this, you're accumulating a potential fine of $75,000. And, by the way, there's no way you can go to court to challenge our determination that this is a wetlands until such time as we choose to sue you.",
  "Well, so what? Somebody from the EPA says we think that your backyard is a wetlands; so, don't build. So, what do we -- what does the homeowner do, having bought that property?",
  "Well, all right, I'm just going to put it aside as a nature preserve.",
  "That makes the EPA's conduct here even more outrageous: We -- we think now that this is wetlands that are -- that qualify; so, we're going to hit you with this compliance order, but, you know, when we look into it more thoroughly in the future, we might change our mind.",
  "Can I ask you a question about timing? Let's suppose that the district court in Washington moves expeditiously and issues a decision in mid-February. Are there insuperable problems with postponing the Texas primary so that the plan that is to be used can -- doesn't have to be formulated until after the district court in Washington has ruled? Texas has a very early primary. Some States have them for congressional races in -- in the fall, and the latest presidential primary I think is at the end of June. So, why can't this all be pushed back, and wouldn't that eliminate a lot of the problems that we are grappling with in this case?",
  "Well, if we have a binary choice, if it's either the plan enacted by the Texas legislature or the plan that's already been drawn up by the court, yes, that could be presumably resolved rather quickly. But what if neither of those is fully acceptable? Then is it -- is it practicable to have the primary on the date that's been agreed on? And if not, then wouldn't -- would you just prefer to limit us to those two possibilities or would Texas entertain the possibility of moving the primary back?",
  "Well, what are neutral districting principles? Anybody who draws a map faces at the outset certain legal constraints, constitutional constraints, restrictions that are imposed by the Voting Rights Act, maybe some State law restrictions to the extent they're not inconsistent with Federal law. Once you've gotten beyond that point, all you have left is districting policy. They're policy choices, and there are many factors that can be taken into account in drawing a map: how compact you want the districts to be, to what extent are you going to respect zones of common economic interests, to what extent are you going to try to preserve old districts, what about incumbents, what about party registration? Are you going to try to have balance or are you going to try to favor one party or the other? That's all -- those are all questions of policy. And the question is, whose -- who makes those policy decisions? Are they going to be the policy decisions that were made by the legislature, or are they going to be the policy decisions made by the district court? And to say they're going to apply neutral districting principles is a subterfuge. There is no such thing.",
  "Well, I don't want to interrupt you too much, but even if you do that, even if you start with the old plan and then you modify it to the extent necessary to comply with the Constitution and statutes, there are still -- I'm sure our computer could shoot out dozens and dozens of possible maps, and somebody has to choose among them. Now, what criteria does a district judge -- does a district court use in making that choice?",
  "Well, let's say -- let's say a legislature says we have a new policy, and that is that once we've satisfied our constitutional obligations and our obligations under the Voting Rights Act, the only thing we're going to do is try to draw the districts that are the most compact possible, compactness over everything else. They draw up a plan that embodies that policy, and it's challenged under section 5. Now, can the district court just say, well, that's -- the State's policy is compactness over everything else, but we don't agree with that, because we have other neutral principles that advance the interest of the collective public good, which is the term that this -- the words that this court used. Can they do that?",
  "Well, if they can't do that, then you're saying that they are constrained by State policy, except to the extent the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act requires otherwise.",
  "Well, if Texas says we don't care about maintaining voting precincts; this is -- this is a matter of -- of administrative burden and expense, and we're willing to bear that, so disregard that, the district court can say, well, we think -- we disagree with you; in order to make it more convenient to hold the election and less expensive for Texas, we're going to respect voting districts. They can do that?",
  "But could they do that?",
  "Could the district court do that? That's my question.",
  "Well, that's for presidential primaries, isn't it? I don't want to interrupt, but isn't that the date of the last presidential primary rather than congressional?",
  "If the special assessment requires a different kind of notice and possibly a different kind of opt-in or opt-out regime, would the case be moot?",
  "Well, we're not dealing here with the kind of notice -- with the typical Hudson notice given at the beginning of the year, when the annual dues are collected. We're dealing with a special assessment. Now, if a different kind of notice is constitutionally required in that context, would this case be moot?",
  "My question is whether the -- the different requirements, which presumably were not met here in the context of the special assessment, if there are different requirements in that context, would that be enough to preserve this case as a live controversy?",
  "What does this local, and what will the other locals, do in the future when special assessments are made? Will they provide notice or will they go back to the old system?",
  "Is it incorrect that this was for what was termed a \"Political Fight-Back Fund\"?",
  "Well, let me give you this example, and maybe you'll say that this is different from your case and the rules should be different in these two cases. The annual dues for particular -- for members of this union are 1 percent of their salaries, and let's say that amounts to -- or it's a certain percentage of their salaries, and let's say that amounts to $500 annual dues. And let's say that, in the prior year, 90 percent of the money collected by the union was used for chargeable purposes, 10 percent for non-chargeable purposes. So, someone who objected, a nonmember who objected, would be able to get back $50. Now, during the course of the year, the union levies a special assessment or whatever you want to call it, and for this 90 -- the percentages are exactly reversed: 90 percent is for non-chargeable; 10 percent is for chargeable. So, now a nonmember who potentially wants to object has $450 at stake. Now, in that situation, why shouldn't there be separate notice? Aren't the economic incentives quite different?",
  "Well, as I said, my hypothetical may be very different from what happened here, and maybe it's an unrealistic hypothetical; and you can answer that. But if -- if it were to occur, should there not be Hudson notice?",
  "But what if the money is going to be used for an election campaign? What if it is going to be used to weigh in, in favor of one gubernatorial candidate against another, in favor of one slate of legislative candidates against another? And on those issues, the nonmembers may have very strong partisan and ideological objections. So, why should they not be given a notice at that time - -",
  "-- and given the opportunity not to give what would be at a minimum a -- an interest-free loan - -",
  "-- for the purpose of influencing an election campaign?",
  "Suppose that the - -",
  "Suppose that the proponents of Propositions 75 and 76 had come to the union and said, would you please give us an interest-free loan for money because we want to use this money to -- to persuade the electorate to enact these; but don't worry because we're going to pay it back right after the election, when we've achieved our electoral ends. Would -- would the union provide the money because it's all going to come out in the wash?",
  "Well, I -- gee, I really doubt that you -- that they would. But what's the difference? If you look at this from the perspective of a nonmember who doesn't want those ballot initiatives to be defeated, saying that we're going to give you your money back -- we're going to use your money to achieve a political end that you oppose, but don't worry because we're going to give it back to you next year after we've achieved our political end -- how does that solve the problem?",
  "What will happen when -- when we get to the point where -- when there are only a handful of people in the entire country who are still receiving television programs via the airwaves?",
  "Well, you want us to overrule a decision of this Court, Pacifica.",
  "Now, as to radio, what -- what has changed?",
  "To justify that? Well, could we hold that the policy is -- is invalid as to -- on First Amendment grounds as to TV but not as to radio?",
  "Well, if we rule in your favor on the First Amendment grounds, what will people who watch Fox be seeing between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.? Are they going to be seeing a lot of people parading around in the nude and a stream of expletives?",
  "So, what will you put on that you are not able to put on now?",
  "Well, broadcast TV is -- is living on borrowed time. It's not going to be long before it goes the way of vinyl records and eight-track tapes.",
  "Well, no, I'm sure.",
  "I'm sure your clients will continue to make billions of dollars on their programs which are -- which are transmitted by cable and by satellite and by Internet. But the -- to the extent that they're making money from people who are using rabbit ears, that's -- that's disappearing. Do you disagree with that?",
  "Yes. Well, so, why not just let this die a natural death? Why do you want us to intervene --",
  "Well, you're asking us to intervene by overruling a prior precedent.",
  "But isn't that inherent in the context-based approach? Unless you have an approach that says there are certain body parts you can never show, then aren't you going to get into -- isn't someone going to be able to come up and say you had this broadcast and you said that's okay; and this one, you said is not okay?",
  "Well, following up on Justice Kagan's question, I have -- I have difficulty seeing how providing 12 weeks of leave for self-care for both men and women affects the incentive of an employer who we will assume has an inclination to discriminate against women based on the possibility that a woman applicant for employment may become pregnant. I just don't see how that would affect the incentives of -- of an employer in that situation.",
  "Well, (A) is not at issue, right? Okay. So, we're just dealing with (D), which concerns a serious health condition. So, you have an employer who is willing to discriminate on the basis of gender. The employer has two applicants for employment, a man and a woman, and the employer says, well, if I hire the man, he might take 12 weeks of leave for a serious medical condition, and if I hire the woman, she might take 12 weeks of leave for a serious medical condition which might be something that either men or women could get, or it also could be a sickness related to pregnancy. So, there still is -- there still would be an incentive for this hypothetical employer to discriminate against the woman.",
  "How does it do that? That's what I'm -- I understand that, and it's a worthy objective. I just don't understand how giving both men and women 12 weeks of leave for self-care affects the incentive.",
  "Well, with respect to the Commerce Clause, could I ask you this: If we were to disagree with you on the Fourteenth Amendment and hold that it -- that Congress didn't validly abrogate State sovereign immunity with respect to subsection (D), would your client still be able to seek reinstatement or other injunctive relief?",
  "Here the district court completely dismissed your FMLA claim, not just insofar as you sought damages. I -- I think you also sought reinstatement and other equitable relief, but the district court dismissed it completely.",
  "But you're not contesting that, are you?",
  "You said \"in this case.\" That's basically what I'm asking. If we were to disagree with you on the Fourteenth Amendment, are you asking us simply -- would we then simply affirm the Fourth Circuit? Or would we have to -- would we have to make some accommodation for the possibility that the dismissal of your claim, insofar as you sought injunctive relief, may have been improper?",
  "I am really trying to be a little bit helpful to you. And I - -",
  "Okay.",
  "I thought you - -",
  "I thought you did, but maybe I'm reading your complaint more generously than you read it yourself.",
  "Assume for the sake of argument that for the -- the applicants for particular provisions -- particular positions, I should say - - where the applicants are typically of a certain age, men tend to take less sick leave than women, because women also take sick leave for pregnancy-related illnesses. So, giving everybody 12 weeks eliminates the -- the possibility that women -- women who will be -- want to take additional -- will want to take more sick leave will be fired because they exceed the amount of sick leave allowed by the employer for everybody. Now, isn't that connected to eliminating discrimination in employment?",
  "Well, I don't think -- I have difficulty with the incentives argument either - - honestly, either as to (D) or as to (C). But I'm just talking about the -- an argument based on consequences. If an employer says you get 2 weeks of sick leave, period; after that, if you can't come back, you're fired -- that may -- at least for applicants within a certain age range, that may have a much more severe or a more severe impact on women than on men.",
  "What would the answer to that be, that that's not intentional discrimination?",
  "Well, what if Congress had added three additional subsections here and said that an employer has to provide 12 weeks of unpaid leave so that an employee can go to a health spa, 12 weeks of unpaid leave for -- so that the employee can travel, 12 weeks of unpaid leave so that the employee can take an educational course? Now, that -- those could be taken advantage of by either men and women. It makes both men and women increasingly unattractive as employees and, therefore, reduces the any special disincentive that might have been created by (A), (B), and (C). Now, on that same logic, would those be - - would those be provisions that further the elimination of discrimination based on gender?",
  "Well, if the State of Maryland thinks this is good social policy, why is it asserting its sovereign immunity?",
  "But you can waive. Can't you waive your -- your Eleventh Amendment immunity?",
  "Are you conceding in answer to these questions that your reading doesn't really make any sense; that's just what Congress -- that's what Congress did?",
  "Well, what sense does it make? What -- why should the ceiling depend on whether an employee is getting compensation voluntarily from the employer or as a result of a formal award? If you have two identical -- identically situated employees and one is getting the compensation without an award and one is getting it with an award, as you understand the term \"award,\" why -- what sense does it make to treat them differently?",
  "They're identically situated in every respect except one. One has a formal award; one does not. What sense does it make to treat them differently then?",
  "Why does it matter whether the privately retained attorney works in close cooperation with government employees? Suppose in this case Mr. Filarsky had simply been hired to go off and perform this investigation and, at the end of the investigation, report the results to the town? Would the case come out differently then?",
  "Suppose -- suppose the government hires an attorney to do an independent investigation; it hires an outside attorney precisely because it does not want to be faced with allegations that it has manipulated the outcome of the investigation because its own conduct is at issue. So, they say you're going to be independent, hands-off; we're not going to interfere at all. But that would still in your -- in your submission satisfy the coordination requirement?",
  "What is the difference between that and the prison situation? The private prison -- the guard in the private prison is performing a function that has been delegated to that or assumed by that entity pursuant to a contract. I don't understand exactly what the difference is.",
  "Well, what about your test? What is your test?",
  "Well, suppose you have a lawyer who's a part-time employee. Does that matter?",
  "A part-time employee of a government unit.",
  "So, the difference, your difference, is between an employee and an independent contractor?",
  "And isn't that often a very difficult determination under the law?",
  "But there are a lot of - - there are a lot of -- I think -- well, there are a lot of law firms. I think all law firms other than public interest firms are for-profit firms, and the attorneys are part-time employees of municipalities and other government units to perform various functions, part-time judges, part-time prosecutors.",
  "Well, now you're talking about history. But I want to know how we are -- how the courts are to determine and why it should matter how a municipality sets this up. Suppose the town had hired Mr. Filarsky as a part-time town employee. So, he has a certain -- he has a 1-year contract or 6-month contract or something for a certain amount of money to perform services for a certain number of hours. You would say that he would be entitled to qualified immunity then.",
  "Why?",
  "Because he's an employee. They pass a resolution saying he's an employee of the town.",
  "I thought you were drawing a distinction between employees and independent contractors. Is that the distinction you're drawing or not?",
  "Are you saying it's clearly established that there isn't a difference between going in and looking for the insulation, et cetera, and telling him to bring it out? Is it clearly established that the -- that as a condition of employment in a situation like this, the employee cannot be required to submit to a search?",
  "But the Court's cases are a mix of history and -- and policy. The Court has recognized both absolute immunity -- has recognized absolute immunity in instances where there wasn't absolute immunity at common law; isn't that true?",
  "Well, suppose a municipality were to -- or a State were to abolish all the civil service rules and all the special rules and go back to employment at will for government employees. Would that -- would that take with it the whole qualified immunity regime?",
  "It seems strange because the immunities, at least some of the immunities, long pre-date the -- the institution of the civil service system. Everybody is subject to market forces. Every person who works is influenced by market forces to some degree; isn't that correct?",
  "Well, the political appointees within the United States Department of Justice are not protected by civil service. So, should they lack immunity?",
  "They're subject to market forces, aren't they?",
  "But I can hardly even think of a statutory interpretation question that we've gotten that doesn't involve some degree of ambiguity, if we're honest about it. We take a case where there's a conflict in the courts of appeals. And so, there was at least enough ambiguity in those cases for one or more courts of appeals to come to an interpretation that's contrary to the one that we ultimately reach. So, what degree of ambiguity is Brand X referring to?",
  "What's the difference between someone who commits the crime just before the Act is passed and someone who commits the crime just after the Act is passed? The person who commits the crime just after the Act is passed had the expectation prior to the passage of the Act that if he did certain things, he wouldn't -- he wouldn't have this consequence from his conduct.",
  "But the person who -- who commits the crime just after the Act is passed had the expectation prior to that time, that had -- if he did certain things in the future, he wouldn't suffer certain consequences.",
  "Do you think we have the authority to tell Congress how to draft its laws? I thought what we were doing was trying to infer what they intended.",
  "Do we send them a drafting manual? Now, you can do this, but you can only do it if you do it -- if you follow the steps that we've prescribed. And you've said this over and over. It seems to be completely unfounded.",
  "So, if he came to the United States at 15 from Jamaica, he was a resident of the United States before he came - -",
  "Would he be a resident of Jamaica, too, at that time?",

  "If Congress had wanted to use the term \"resided\" in the ordinary sense of the word, they wanted to require that the alien actually have lived in the United States continuously for 7 years, what language would they have used? What language should they have used?",
  "If they wanted (2) to mean that the alien must have actually -- that person must - - the one who committed the crime later must actually have resided in the United States continuously for 7 years - -",
  "-- then what should they - - actually lived in the United States for 7 years, what language should they have used?",
  "For a minor.",
  "For that to apply to everybody.",
  "\"Domicile\" is a legal term. You don't go around and you meet somebody and say, Where are you domiciled?",
  "You might not even say, Where do you reside? But it's closer to being ordinary language.",
  "But do you think this is just a labeling statute? Quicken could charge whatever it wanted, bottom line, but if it breaks it down into categories and it doesn't do something that's actually attributable to one of those categories, then there's a violation?",
  "Well, why does your-- why does your interpretation make sense? Shouldn't we view this against the backdrop of the American rule on fees, that each party generally bears its own costs and only in specific circumstances does the loser pay? Now, the taxation of costs is a very narrow concept. What is the difference between a case in which a lot of documents have to be rendered from one language to another prior to the court proceeding and a case in which there's a mass of scientific evidence that has to be interpreted by a scientist or financial evidence that has to be interpreted by an accountant? In those instances, the losing party doesn't pay for the winner's expenses, does it?",
  "Well, the background -- costs get taxed, but costs are very narrow. They are a very small part of the expenses of a party litigating a case. Isn't that -- isn't that true?",
  "Suppose somebody --",
  "Suppose somebody did a computer search in a database of, let's say, newspaper articles, magazine articles for use of the term \"interpreter\" in relationship to a foreign language. And let's say you look at a thousand hits. How many of those do you think would use the term \"interpreter\" to refer to rendering a written document from one language to another?",
  "How much would you bet?",
  "If you bet me enough, I'll look at a thousand. I'd be surprised if it's 2 percent.",
  "I think you've conceded away your case when you say that. The one characteristic of a verdict that seems perfectly clear to me is that it is final. The jury can't render a verdict and be discharged and then come back the next day and say, you know what, some of us -- one of us has changed his mind or her mind. It's the final vote. And so, why isn't the critical question here whether what the -- what the foreperson said was this is our final vote, we're not going to go back, this is it; or this is the way we voted now, and it's -- one or more of us may have wanted to -- wanted to retain the right, reserve the right, to go back and -- and vote again.",
  "Are you saying --",
  "Are you saying that there was no manifest necessity to declare a mistrial as to any count, in which case there could be no retrial whatsoever, or no manifest necessity to declare a mistrial on capital murder? And if you're saying the latter, then what would you have us do with the decision by the Arkansas Supreme Court that Arkansas law does not allow a partial verdict?",
  "You suggested that the --",
  "Is this a fair explanation of Arkansas law, which doesn't seem to me to be perfectly clear? What the jury is supposed to do is to vote on the greatest offense first and reach a reasonably firm vote. And if they reach a reasonably firm vote that is unanimous not guilty, then they can move on to the next -- to the lower offenses, but that reasonably firm vote is not an absolutely final vote, and there is still the possibility for the jury to go back.",
  "Is that a correct understanding?",
  "For double --",
  "For double jeopardy purposes, is the question what Arkansas law actually says, or what the jury understood Arkansas law to be?",
  "In Green --",
  "In Green and Price, the defendants were tried once on the greater offense, and jeopardy terminated without a finding of manifest necessity regarding the termination of jeopardy. To me that is the sound basis for those decisions. But I have to agree with what Justice Kagan said. The -- Justice Black's reasoning in Green, that the jury impliedly acquitted the defendant of the greater offense by convicting the defendant of the -- of the lesser offense doesn't really make any sense because they could have simply been in disagreement about the greater offense.",
  "Is your -­",
  "Is your argument limited to statements that a person makes about himself or herself?",
  "What's the principal reason for drawing the line there? Suppose the statute also made it a crime to represent falsely that someone else was the recipient of a military medal, so that if someone said falsely and knowingly that a spouse or a parent or a child was a medal recipient, that would also be covered.",
  "That would be protected by the First Amendment?",
  "Do you really think that there is -- that the First Amendment -- that there is First Amendment value in a bald-faced lie about a purely factual statement that a person makes about himself, because that person would like to create a particular persona? Gee, I won the Medal of Honor. I was a Rhodes scholar. I won the Nobel Prize. There's a personal -­ the First Amendment protects that?",
  "But you -- you acknowledge that the First Amendment allows the prohibition or the regulation of false speech if it causes at least certain kinds of harms. And the problem I have with your argument is determining which harms you think count and which harms don't count. Would you go as far as was suggested earlier to say that only pecuniary harm counts? If you -- if you say that, then the -- the classic case of intentional infliction of emotional distress is unconstitutional, going up to someone and saying falsely your -- your child has just been run over by a bus. So, how do we determine which harms are sufficient?",
  "When you say \"imminent,\" you mean -- what do you mean by that?",
  "Well, if that's the standard, then most of the prosecutions for making false statements to a Federal law enforcement officer are not going to survive, are they?",
  "Well, then you're not really talking about imminent harm, I don't think. You're just talking about harm.",
  "It seems to me what you're -- what you're arguing is that we should determine that there are certain harms that are sufficient to allow the prohibition of a false statement and there are certain harms that are not sufficient, irrespective of what judgment Congress made about the significance of those harms. Is that -- is that accurate?",
  "So that would mean -­",
  "But that's not -- the answer is would the First Amendment permit that.",
  "Well, that's sort of the question we have to answer here.",
  "Suppose what the person gets is -- is a date with a potential rich spouse. Would that be enough?",
  "Some people might have a different opinion.",
  "It sounds to me that what you're -- what you're arguing is that the court of appeals abused its discretion in viewing this as a plain forfeiture, which you've just said would permit the court of appeals to raise the issue sua sponte, instead of a deliberate waiver. Is that what it comes down to?",
  "They put it in the wrong -- they -- they abused their discretion by putting it in the wrong box. They didn't put it in the forfeiture box; they put it in the deliberate waiver box.",
  "Well, this is what -- this is what troubles me about your argument that the court of appeals abused its discretion. Is it correct that you did not raise the issue of the court of appeals' lack of authority to raise this sua sponte until rehearing?",
  "But you’re -- but you're arguing that the court of appeals abused its discretion by failing to rule in your favor on an argument that you didn't make?",
  "What Rule of Civil Procedure applies here? You're talking about appellate procedure here. Is there a rule of appellate procedure that governs this?",
  "Well, they refer to what happens in the district court, and Day dealt with that. Now you're in the court of appeals. What rule is there that addresses the situation in the court of appeals?",
  "You made an argument in your brief that I found a little difficult to follow, but -- so, maybe you can explain it. You seemed to suggest that the State's position on timeliness in the district court somehow induced your client to dismiss the claims that were arguably not exhausted. And I found it difficult to understand why the -- why your client's strategy as to whether he wanted to dismiss those claims or not would be affected by the State's position on timeliness.",
  "That's what I don't understand. I -- why -- you have two situations. One situation, the State's raising timeliness. So, he says, okay, they're raising timeliness; I'm not going to dismiss my -- the claims that they say are not exhausted. The other situation, they -- they don't say anything about timeliness. And he said now I'm going to dismiss the claims that are -- that they say are unexhausted. I don't understand the connection.",
  "Yes, I understand why that's a benefit to him, but what is the connection between that and the dismissal of the unexhausted claims?",
  "Isn't the screening function that the -- that a district court performs in the habeas case inconsistent with the traditional rule about raising affirmative defenses?",
  "Well, let me give you this example of -- of a regular civil case: There -- there are two defendants and the same claim against two defendants. One defendant files an answer and raises a statute of limitations defense; the other one doesn't. The judge asks the second defendant, are you going to amend your complaint? And the defendant says no. Now, is that a waiver or is that a forfeiture?",
  "Well, under the terminology that we're using, wouldn't that be a forfeiture?",
  "Well, why do you say that the position that the State took in the district court prevented the district court from considering the timeliness issue? If it wasn't a deliberate waiver, then the district court under Day wasn't prohibited from -- from deciding the case untimely.",
  "Well, I may have forgotten the procedural complications of this case, but here, did the State have any opportunity before the court of appeals to raise the timeliness issue prior to the time when the court of appeals issued its certificate of appealability? And if the court of appeals had not issued a certificate of appealability on the issue of timeliness, would the issue have come up at all?",
  "If a State knows that it has a potential statute of limitations defense and says nothing, is that a forfeiture or a waiver?",
  "So, simply saying nothing can be a waiver, in your view.",
  "If the answer to that is not, then what is the difference between saying nothing, knowing that you have a defense, and saying we're not challenging but we're not conceding? What is the difference?",
  "Well, let me just ask it one more way, and then I'll --",
  "Back in the office, they're considering -- in the State's office, they're considering what they're going to do. And they say, well, what we're going to do is we're not going to challenge it, but we're not going to concede it. And, therefore, they say nothing.",
  "Why would you make that concession? Why wouldn't it be possible in that -- for an employee to choose? If the employee had both constitutional and nonconstitutional claims, perhaps that employee could take advantage of the review scheme that's outlined by the Government. But in the situation where there's purely a challenge to a statute, the employee would have the option of bringing the claim in one of the district courts.",
  "There are at least -- at least three different kinds of constitutional claims, and I'm not sure where you're drawing the line with respect to your argument. There's a claim that -- that the agency acted in an unconstitutional manner, not that any statute is unconstitutional --",
  "-- but there's unconstitutional executive action. There's an as- applied claim. Let's say that a plaintiff says that the registration requirement is unconstitutional as applied to me, not to other people, but to me because I'm a conscientious objector or I have religious objections to military action that the United States is taking at this particular time. And then there's this -- there's a claim that this statute is unconstitutional on its face. Now, where do you -- which of those can the Merit Systems Protection Review Board decide? Just the first category?",
  "So, it's not a distinction between as-applied and facial?",
  "How can it -- how can it deal with discovery without knowing -- without going into the merits of the constitutional claim? In other words, the parties can just put in any evidence they want?",
  "Any evidence they think might be possibly be relevant to the case, they can put that in. It can be discovery of anything.",
  "But they're not at all the same claim. They're related, but one says the statute means something; and insofar as it's applied to a particular situation, it's unconstitutional. The other one says it doesn't mean that.",
  "When we -- just let me rephrase that. If -- if this Court adopts a certain interpretation based on the principle of constitutional avoidance, do you think the Court is rewriting the statute?",
  "Congress is -- Congress is unhappy when this Court holds a statute unconstitutional.",
  "Do you think it's -- it's really likely that they intended for the MS -- MSPRB to have the authority to declare its acts unconstitutional?",
  "If anybody who drafted or voted for the Civil Service Reform Act had thought about a case like this, where it's a pure question of law, a facial challenge to the constitutionality of a statute, do you think they would have said, well, the way we think that this should be handled is this scheme that you have proposed?",
  "I suspect that if this were litigated in district court, the government would move to dismiss and would take the position that it doesn't matter; even if women can now do 99 percent of the -- the things that are done in the military, the Registration Act is still constitutional. Wouldn't you take that position?",
  "Would you say that if -- if it can be proven that they've -- that women are now -- that the percentage is now high enough, the statute may be unconstitutional? Anyway, assuming that you might take that position, then -- and you might win on that -- then what would be the point of having all of this discovery that you're talking about?",
  "All of this -- all of this development of the factual record? What -- what sense does it make to develop a big factual record before you know whether it's even -- whether it even makes any difference?",
  "Well, there's no particular connection between the events here and the United States. So, I think the question is whether there's any other country in the world where these plaintiffs could have brought these claims against the Respondents.",
  "Is there a yes or no answer to that question or not?",
  "Where?",
  "Any other country other than the country of the citizenship of the defendants?",
  "Have all the judges who have interpreted that opinion interpreted it the way you just did?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, what did -- how did Judge Kavanaugh interpret that on the D.C. Circuit?",
  "There's no connection to the United States whatsoever. The Alien Tort Statute was enacted, it seems to be -- there seems to be a consensus, to prevent the United States -- to prevent international tension, to -- and -- does this -- this kind of a lawsuit only creates international tension.",
  "Do you really that think the first Congress wanted victims of the French Revolution to be able to sue in -- in the court -- to sue French defendants in the courts of the United States?",
  "Could I ask you this --",
  "Yes. Is there an Article III source of jurisdiction for a lawsuit like this?",
  "Well, what's the constitutional basis for a lawsuit like this, where an alien is suing an alien?",
  "I don't understand that.",
  "I still don't understand your explanation of the reason why Congress would draw a distinction between an individual and an organization. You keep saying that the -- in the case of the individual, the individual was here. But the organization can be here, too.",
  "Mr. Gannon, suppose two people are tortured, and one is an alien who has never been within 10,000 miles of the United States, and the other is a U.S. citizen. The position of the United States is that the alien can sue, but the U.S. citizen can't?",
  "No, but two victims of torture -- you don't find that to be an incongruous result?",

  "Suppose Mr. Rahim had never been naturalized. I guess that was a mistake.",
  "Could the city cure the problem by rescinding the forgiveness for those who paid under the installment plan -­",
  "Why not?",
  "I think you've put your finger on the reason for this, which is that the city calculated that what it did would be more politically acceptable than treating the people who paid up front equally on an economic basis with the people who paid in installment plans. Now, if that's the reason for this, is that rational?",
  "But what does that mean, they wanted to get out of the Barrett Law business?",
  "That really doesn't seem very complicated, to collect payments that people have agreed to pay. And if they didn't want to do it anymore, I bet they could have contracted that out for a very modest fee to any number of private entities that would have done it for them.",
  "Well, I still don't -­",
  "Other than political expediency and administrative convenience, I still don't understand what rational basis you claim there was for the distinction that was drawn. Now, maybe one of those is sufficient, but other than those two possible bases, I don't see another one.",
  "Those are reasons for not giving refunds, but what are the reasons for forgiving the debt that people agreed to?",
  "Well, they want forgiveness, but you outline correctly in your brief the fact that the city had three options. One of the options was to hold everybody to what they understood when they signed up under the Barrett Law. And I -- I do not understand how your administrative convenience argument fits in with the decision to forgive the debt of the people who agreed to pay on the installment plan. When the city was collecting those payments was that a net loss? Were the administrative costs of making those collections more than the amount of money that was brought in? If not, then I don't see how administrative convenience justifies a rejection of that option.",
  "It's rational for a city to say that it costs us $100,000 to collect this money, and if we do collect it, we're going to bring in $500,000; so, we don't want to pay the $100,000; so, we're going to get rid of the program? That's rational?",
  "No, but the net -- the net -­",
  "If the net -- if it's a net gain, what is the rationality of abandoning it?",
  "You put your finger on it. They want to get out of the business. What they've done is to shift the cost of the sewers from a -- from a small group, a small interest group that is able to presumably exert some political power to -- to everybody. They spread the cost around to everybody. And everybody -- the ordinary person who has to pay a little bit more every month doesn't get all fired up about it. That's what this -- that's what this is about, isn't it?",
  "Is -­",
  "Is there some identified or identifiable demographic difference between the two groups that either justifies or could on -- on a remand justify the different treatment?",
  "But time is usually a rational reason for doing it. If -- suppose everybody paid on the installment plan. The city could say as of a certain date we're -- no more installment payments. And the people who paid up previously, would -- would they be -- would they have an equal protection claim?",
  "Suppose that there had never been the option of making the lump-sum payment. Everybody paid on installment plans over a 10-year period, and then the city decided January 1, 2012, no more installment plans; everything that's still due is forgiven. That would be rational, wouldn't it?",
  "Suppose a State legislature got the crazy idea that children born to married people during the time of the marriage shouldn't inherit under State intestacy law. Would that mean that they would be ineligible for survivors' benefits?",
  "But what if they did -- what if they did that?",
  "Maybe it means something else. Maybe it means that to the Congress that initially enacted the predecessor of this provision a child was a child. They knew what a child was. And the type of child that I mentioned earlier was a child. There wasn't a need for any definition of that. And they -- they never had any inkling about the situation that has arisen in this case, just as they had no inkling that any State would go off and take away intestacy rights for children born to married people during the course of their marriage.",
  "Why doesn't the last sentence of -- what is it -- (h)(2)(A) show that Congress had in mind a certain idea of a category of people who were indisputably children? I don't see how you can get around that, because it says what you're looking for under State law is to determine whether someone has the same status relative to taking intestate personal property as a child.",

  "There was no maximum.",
  "And what's -- what --",
  "So, if the judge can -- if it's totally up to the discretion of the judge, that's fine; but if Congress enacts a statute that structures the fine -- and says, if this is the case, then so much; if that's the case, then so much more -- then you have to have a jury trial?",

  "What do you mean when you say that, that they have not addressed it? If a State law allows it, have they not addressed it?",
  "So, legislators don't understand that their law permits this?",
  "But I don't really understand this argument. You mean the legislatures have enacted these laws, but they don't realize that, under these laws, a -- a person under the age of 18 may be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for -- for murder. They don't understand that?",
  "If you think these legislators don't understand what their laws provide, why don't you contact them? And when they -- when you tell them, do you realize that in your State a -- a 16-year-old or a 17-year-old may be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for murder, they'll say: Oh, my gosh, I never realized that; let's change the law.",

  "No?",
  "Well, maybe the majority in the court of appeals was wrong in its application of the harmless-error test. I didn’t think that was the reason why we took this, why we took this case. What I'm concerned about is the test. Now, the only aspect of -- the only thing that I understand that really differentiates your position from the Government with respect to the test is whether the focus is on a rational jury or on this particular jury. And when you say the focus should be on this particular jury, aren't you calling for a speculation by the -- by an appellate court? How is an appellate court supposed to tell whether this particular jury was different from a hypothetical rational jury?",
  "Mr. Yang, I think you may be taking a harder position than you really need to. Why shouldn't the rule be that the -- the appellate court should look at what would be done by a rational jury, except in the kind of extraordinary circumstances that have been posited by Justice Kagan's hypothetical and a few of the other questions, simply because it's so difficult to determine what a -- what the jury was actually doing? We have a rule that prohibits consideration of what goes on in the jury room. But suppose we didn't have that. Suppose that it was all videotaped, and the jury didn't know what was going on, so you could -- you could watch it and see. If that were the case, then surely the rule would be what would this jury have done? But most of the time, it's just speculation to tell what a jury -- what they -- did they come back quickly? Well, that shows that this evidence was so bad that it caused them to render a quick verdict in what otherwise would have been a difficult case. Did they take a long time? Well, it shows it was a close case, and, therefore, any error might have tipped them one way or the other. You just can't tell.",
  "Did the panel majority in -- did the panel majority in this case say anything that differs from what this Court has said about harmless error? If we were to reverse, what would we point to in the panel majority's opinion that was erroneous?",

Now, if there are a lot of cases that call it jurisdictional, but none of them would have come out differently if the Anti-Injunction Act were simply a mandatory claims-processing rule -- you have that on one side. And on the other side, you have Davis, where the Court accepted a waiver by the Solicitor General; the Sunshine Anthracite coal case, where there also was a waiver; and there's the Williams Packing case, which is somewhat hard to understand as viewing the Anti-Injunction Act as a jurisdictional provision. The Court said that there could be a suit if there's no way the government could win and the plaintiff would suffer irreparable harm. Now, doesn't that sound like an equitable exception to the Anti-Injunction Act?",

And the person says, no, I don't want that. I want to continue to get -- just get care here from the emergency room.

You are financing your burial services right now because eventually you're going to die, and somebody is going to have to pay for it, and if you don't have burial insurance, or you haven't saved money for it, you're going to shift the cost to somebody else. Isn't that a very artificial way of talking about what somebody is doing?",
  "And if that's true, why isn't it equally artificial to say that somebody who is doing absolutely nothing about health care is financing health care services?",
  "I don't see the difference. You can get burial insurance. You can get health insurance. Most people are going to need health care, almost everybody. Everybody is going to be buried or cremated at some point.",

You can correct me if these figures are wrong, but it appears to me that the CBO has estimated that the average premium for a single insurance policy in the non-group market will be roughly $5,800 in -- in 2016. Respondents -- the economists who have supported the Respondents estimate that a young, healthy individual targeted by the mandate on average consumes about $854 in health services each year. So, the mandate is forcing these people to provide a huge subsidy to the insurance companies for other purposes that the Act wishes to serve, but isn't -- if those figures are right, isn't it the case that what this mandate is really doing is not requiring the people who are subject to it to pay for the services that they are going to consume? It is requiring them to subsidize services that will be received by somebody else.",
  "Are you --",
  "Are you denying this? If you took the group of people who are subject to the mandate and you calculated the amount of health care services this whole group would consume and figured out the cost of an insurance policy to cover the services that group would consume, the cost of that policy would be much, much less than the kind of policy that these people are now going to be required to purchase under the Affordable Care Act.",
  "That’s not -- the point is -- no, you take into account that some people in that group are going to be hit by a bus, some people in that group are going to unexpectedly contract or be diagnosed with a disease that -- that is very expensive to treat. But if you take their costs and you calculate that, that's a lot less than the amount that they're going to be required to pay. So that you can't just justify this on the basis of their trying to shift their costs off to other people, can you?",
  "Could you just say--",
  "Before you move on, could you express your limiting principle as succinctly as you possibly can? Congress can force people to purchase a product where the failure to purchase the product has a substantial effect on interstate commerce, if what? If this is part of a larger regulatory scheme?",

In his hypothetical, the harm to other people from the communicable disease is the result of the disease. It is not the result of something that the government has done, whereas here the reason why there's cost-shifting is because the government has mandated that. It has required hospitals to provide emergency treatment; and, instead of paying for that through a tax which would be borne by everybody, it has required -- it has set up a system in which the cost is surreptitiously shifted to people who have health insurance and who pay their bills when they go to the hospital.",

  "If -- what would your fallback position be if we don't accept the proposition that if the mandate is declared unconstitutional, the rest of the Act, every single provision, has to fall? Other proposed -- other dispositions have been proposed. There's the Solicitor General's disposition, the recommended disposition to strike down the guaranteed-issue and community-rating provisions. One of the -- one amicus says strike down all of Title I; another says strike down all of Title I and Title II. What -- what would you suggest?",
  "Suppose that there was a - - suppose there was a non-severability provision in -- in this Act. If one provision were to be held unconstitutional, then every single -- someone would have to bring a separate lawsuit challenging every single other provision in the Act and say, well, one fell and the Congress said it's all -- it's -- it's a package, it can't be separated. That's your position?",
  "May I ask you about the argument that's made in the economists' amicus brief? They say that the insurance reforms impose 10-year costs of roughly $700 billion on the insurance industry and that these costs are supposed to be offset by about 350 billion in new revenue from the individual mandate and 350 billion from the Medicaid expansion. Now, if the 350 billion -- maybe you'll disagree with the numbers, that they're fundamentally wrong. But assuming that they're in the ballpark, if the 350 million from the individual mandate were to be lost, what would happen to the insurance industry, which would now be in the -- in the hole for $350 billion over 10 years?",
  "Well, if that is true, what is the difference between guaranteed-issue and community-rating provisions, on the one hand, and other provisions that increase costs substantially for insurance companies? For example, the tax on high cost health plans, which the economists' amicus brief said will cost $217 billion over 10 years?",
  "Well, let me give --",
  "-- you a factual context. Let's say Congress says this to the States: We -- we've got great news for you. We know that your expenditures on education are a huge financial burden, so we're going to take that completely off your shoulders. We are going to impose a special Federal education tax which will raise exactly the same amount of money as all of the States now spend on education, and then we are going to give you a grant that is equal to what you spent on education last year. Now, this is a great offer and we think you will take it, but of course, if you take it, it's going to have some conditions because we're going to set rules on teacher tenure, on collective bargaining, on curriculum, on textbooks, class size, school calendar, and many other things. So, take it or leave it. If you take it, you have to follow our rules on all of these things. If you leave it, well, then you're going to have to fine -- you are going to have to tax your citizens, they're going to have to pay the Federal education tax. But on top of that, you're going to have to tax them for all of the money that you're now spending on education, plus all of the Federal funds that you were previously given. Would that be -- would that reach the point -- would that be the point where financial inducement turns into coercion?",
  "No?",
  "You might be right. But if that's the case, then there's nothing left --",
  "-- of federalism.",
  "And General Verrilli, is this -- is this discussion realistic? The objective of the Affordable Care Act is to provide near universal health care. Now, suppose that all of the 26 States that are parties to this case were to say, well, we're not going to -- we're not going to abide by the new conditions. Then, there would be a huge portion -- a big portion of the population that would not have health care. And it's a realistic possibility that the Secretary is going to say, well, okay, fine, you know, we're going to cut off your new funds, but we're not going to cut off your old funds, and just let that condition sit there?",
  "Well, I'm not following this argument. Take the poorest of the poor. If there is no Medicaid program, then they're not going to get health care. Isn't that right?",
  "And so, Congress obviously assumed -- it thought it was inconceivable that any State would reject this offer, because the objective of the Affordable Care Act is to provide near-universal care, and Medicaid is the way to provide care for at least the poorest of the poor. So, it just didn't occur to them that this was a possibility. When --",
  "When that's the case, how can that not be coercion?",
  "Unless it's just a gift. Unless it's just purely a gift. And it comes back to the question of whether you think it makes a difference that the money -- a lot of the money to pay for this is going to come out of the same taxpayers that the States have to tax to get their money.",
  "Well, is that consistent with the Government's argument? They argue, quote, \"an employee does not make a 'sale' for purposes of the 'outside salesman' exemption unless he actually transfers title to the property at issue.\" The statute refers to a consignment for sale.

  "Well, there might be a few, but there -- but assume that you're drafting this legislation and you want it to apply only to defendants who commit an offense after the enactment of the Fair Sentencing Act, but you also want to do everything that you reasonably can to make sure that when the very first one of those defendants comes up for sentencing, there will be new sentencing guidelines in effect that are geared to the new lower mandatory minimums rather than the old sentencing guidelines in effect. Would you not provide that the -- would you not require the Sentencing Commission to act as quickly as possible to get the new sentencing guidelines out?",
  "No?",
  "You would say take your time and it doesn't matter if a few -- a few defendants who are -- who commit the offense after the enactment of the Fair Sentencing Act come up and they are -- they're subjected to the old soon-to-be-obsolete sentencing guidelines?",
  "Could I ask you this about your argument? Because I do think the one you're stressing now is a -- is a good argument and your best one. But what troubles me is that an earlier bill, H.R. 265, which contained the provision that says \"there shall be no retroactive application of any portion of this Act\" contains the very language that you're stressing now. So, how do you reconcile that?",
  "No, I understand that. But wouldn't you want -- the problem that you're -- maybe -- I understand your argument to be that the language you're stressing now will mean, if this applies only to post-enactment offenders, that there will be defendants who will be sentenced to -- under the -- under old -­ under the old mandatory minimums but the new guidelines.",
  "Would that not occur under the -- clearly occur under H.R. 265?",
  "-- the question -­",
  "Well, along those lines, could I -- could I ask you this question, which is intended to explore the -- the issue whether the argument about bringing the guidelines into consistency with applicable law doesn't assume the answer that is -­ that one attempts to get from it? Suppose the -- the Fair Sentencing Act said expressly this applies only -- the new mandatory minimums apply only to post-Act offenders, but it also contained a provision that says the Sentencing Commission has to bring the guidelines into consistency with applicable law. I assume there what they would have to do would be to say that the new guidelines apply only to post-enactment offenders, so that the Fair Sentencing Act would trump this previous provision in the Sentencing Reform Act. Wouldn't that be correct?",

  "Well, if the Respondent thought that what the judge would determine would indubitably provide the indubitable equivalent, then there wouldn't be an issue here, right?

  "Well, before you move on to the registration requirement, could I take you back to an example that's similar to the one that Justice Breyer was referring to? Let's someone -- let's say someone who is a citizen and a resident of New Mexico, has a New Mexico driver's license, drives across the border, is stopped for speeding, not 60 miles an hour in a 20-mile zone, but 10 miles over the speed limit on an interstate. And the officer, for some reason, thinks that this person may be an illegal alien. How would that work out? If you do the records check, you're not going to get anything back, right, because the person is a citizen? So what -- where would the officer take it from there?",

  "That -- that may be the case, and I would like to ask General Verrilli about that. But, under the Fourth Amendment, presumably, if the officer can arrest -- the state officer can arrest a person on -- simply on the ground that the person is removable, which is what the Office of Legal Counsel opined some years ago, then, presumably, the officer could continue to detain that individual that I mentioned, until they reached a point where the Terry stop becomes an arrest. At which time, they would have to have probable cause. But, if they had probable cause to believe the person was removable, then they could hold the person, presumably, until the -- the person's status was completely verified, isn't that correct?",
  "Well, in that - -",
  "In that regard, we are told that there are some important categories of aliens who can't obtain registration -- cannot obtain Federal registration; and, yet, there are people that nobody would think should be removed.

  "Right.",
  "Well, if the state does - -",
  "Well, I have the same question as the Chief Justice. Suppose that the Federal government changed its priorities tomorrow, and it said -- they threw out the ones they have now. And they said the new policy is maximum enforcement, we want to know about every person who's stopped or arrested, we want -- we want to their immigration status verified. Would -- would the Arizona law then be un-preempted?",
  "Suppose that every -- suppose every law enforcement officer in Arizona saw things exactly the same way as the Arizona legislature. And so, without any direction from the legislature, they all took it upon themselves to make these inquiries every time they stopped somebody or arrested somebody. Would that be a violation of Federal law?",
  "But what if they said, well, we don't care what your priorities are; we -- we have our priorities, and our priority is maximum enforcement, and we're going to call you in every case? It was all done on an individual basis, all the officers were individually doing it - -",
  "-- that would be okay?",
  "That's what I can't understand because your argument -- you seem to be saying that what's wrong with the Arizona law is that the Arizona legislature is trying to control what its employees are doing, and they have to be free to disregard the desires of the Arizona legislature, for whom they work, and follow the priorities of the Federal government, for whom they don't work.",
  "Well, could I ask you this about 2, before you move on to that? How is a -- this is just a matter of information. How can a state officer who stops somebody or who arrests somebody for a nonimmigration offense tell whether that person falls within the Federal removal priorities without making an inquiry to the Federal government? For example, I understand one of the priorities is people who have previously been removed, then that might be somebody who you would want to arrest and -- and remove. But how can you determine that without making the -- the inquiry in the first place?",

Would there be any obligation to begin the treatment prior to the -- to the time when the motion for a stay is -- is filed? Now, could many years go by with the same attorney representing a client, and then at the very last minute -- and no effort is made to obtain treatment that would restore the petitioner to competency, and then at the very last minute, a motion to make -- a motion for a stay is entered, and then this period of time -- 6 months, 9 months, a year, whatever it is - - would begin to run?",

Let's say you have a case where there is a small amount of mitigating evidence about the petitioner's childhood, but not enough to -- to sway the -- the sentencing authority. It's alleged that if the petitioner had been -- if the petitioner was competent, the petitioner could provide a lot more information about what went on during his childhood years; and, therefore, the -- the proceeding has to be stayed indefinitely until the petitioner is restored to confidence or he dies, as happened in Rees. What do you do with that situation?",
  "So if the -- if the district court says, well, there's a little bit here, and I can't rule out the possibility that there might be a lot more that's locked in the petitioner's mind, but he is unable to provide it because he is incompetent, then I'm going to grant a stay until he is restored to competence; and then that would be insulated from being overturned on appeal by abuse of discretion standard.

My understanding is that the university had over 5,000 classes that qualified as small, and the total number of African Americans and Hispanics who were admitted under the part of the plan that is challenged was just a little over 200. So how does that -- how does that -- how can that possibly do more than a tiny, tiny amount to increase classroom diversity?",
  "Per class?",
  "In an entering class.",
  "How many -- how many non-top 10 percent members of the two minorities at issue here are admitted in each class?",

  "Is the critical mass for the University of Texas dependent on the breakdown of the population of Texas?",
  "It's not.",
  "Well, I thought that the whole purpose of affirmative action was to help students who come from underprivileged backgrounds, but you make a very different argument that I don't think I've ever seen before. The top 10 percent plan admits lots of African Americans -- lots of Hispanics and a fair number of African Americans. But you say, well, it's -- it's faulty because it doesn't admit enough African Americans and Hispanics who come from privileged backgrounds. And you specifically have the example of the child of successful professionals in Dallas. Now, that's your -- that's your argument? If you have -- you have an applicant whose parents are -- let's say they're -- one of them is a partner in your law firm in Texas, another one is a part -- is another corporate lawyer. They have income that puts them in the top 1 percent of earners in the country, and they have - - parents both have graduate degrees. They deserve a leg-up against, let's say, an Asian or a white applicant whose parents are absolutely average in terms of education and income?",

  "But would 3 percent be enough in New Mexico, your bordering state, where the African American population is around 2 percent?",

  "Cambodian Americans - - Cambodian Americans?",
  "And do you have a critical mass as to all the subgroups that fall within this enormous group of Asian Americans?",
  "Does the United States agree with Mr. Garre that African American and Hispanic applicants from privileged backgrounds deserve a preference?",
  "If you have two applicants who are absolutely the same in every respect: They both come from affluent backgrounds, well-educated parents. One falls within two of the groups that are given a preference, the other doesn't. It's a marginal case. It's the last -- the last position available in the class. Under the Texas plan, one gets in; one doesn't get in. Now, do you agree with that or not?",

  "Oh, I understand that. And just -- I don't want to cut you off, but - -",
  "-- because the time is about to expire, so you've got a marginal candidate who wants to go to the University of Texas at Austin and is also interested in ROTC. Maybe if race is taken into account, the candidate gets in. Maybe if it isn't, he doesn't get in. How does that impact the military? The candidate will then probably go to Texas A&M or Texas Tech? Is it your position that he will be an inferior military officer if he went to one of those schools?",
  "Then I don't understand the argument.",
  "If we accept the -- if we assume for the sake of argument that \"certainly impending\" is the, the general standard, if we accepted your other argument, that the plaintiffs have standing because they took preventative measures, wouldn't that undermine completely the -- the \"certainly impending\" standard? You have a person who is in a situation where there is a certain risk, a certain degree of risk of - - of the person's conversation being intercepted, but it's not certainly impending. So then the person simply takes some preventative measures, and acquires standing that wouldn't otherwise be present.",
  "Could I go back to a question that Justice Breyer asked, where he used the analogy of a lawyer who is representing someone who is alleged to be an organized crime figure. Suppose you have a case where a lawyer says, I represent so and so, the government thinks this person is an organized crime kingpin, I know the government has a very extensive wiretapping program for people who fall into this category, I want to raise -- I want to challenge the constitutionality of the statute under which some of this wiretapping occurs. Would that person have stand -- would that lawyer have standing?",
  "Do you know of any case that holds that?",
  "The Federal wiretapping statute has been around for 40 years. Has there been a single case that falls into this category that you're talking about?",
  "Well, there is a notice provision under this statute.",
  "Isn't what you just suggested as a way of resolving this case rather bizarre? Someone who is -- whom the government believes to be a top terrorist and a great threat to the country can stop the use of this surveillance by hiring an American lawyer and then having the American lawyer come into court and say -- you know, challenge the constitutionality of this, and the way to resolve the case would be for the government to go into court and say: Well, we're not going to -- we're not going to target this -- this person whom we believe to be a great security threat?",
  "But in Monsanto, suppose the challenge had been brought by a soybean farmer who said, \"I raise soybeans and people around me raise soybeans, I'm afraid that they're going to start planting genetically modified soybeans, but they haven't done it up to this point, but, you know, this might be something they will do in the future and if they do that, then I'm going to have to take precautions.\"",

  "Well, he doing exactly the same thing. Two officers go up to two identical houses. One goes up with the subjective intent to sniff. The other one goes up with the subjective intent to drop off the tickets to the Policeman's Ball. Your answer is one is a search, one is not a search.",
  "I thought the relevance of technology was that the technology that we have now was not necessarily -- was not -- much of it was not available at the time when the Fourth Amendment was adopted, so we can't tell what the -- what people in 1791 would have thought about it. But that's not true of dogs. Dogs were around. They have been around for 10,000 years.",
  "-- and they've been used -- and they've been used to detect scents for 10,000 -- for thousands of years. Certainly, they were available for that purpose in 1791, weren't they?",

  "So in 1791, if someone -- if the police were using -- or somebody was using a bloodhound to track -- someone who was suspected of a crime, and the bloodhound -- and they used the bloodhound to track the person to the front of -- to the front door of a house, would that have been regarded as a trespass?",

  "Without implied consent.",
  "Actual or implied consent.",
  "Well, are there cases that say that the implied consent exists only where the person is coming to the door for a purpose that the homeowner would approve, if the homeowner knew the purpose of the person coming to the door?",
  "So why is that? Why is that? If you took a poll of people and said do you want -- do you want police officers who suspect you of possibly engaging in criminal conduct to come to your front door and knock on the door so they can talk to you and attempt to get incriminating information out of you, would most people say, yes, I consent to that?",
  "You draw a distinction between dogs that are not drug detection dogs and ordinary dogs. Would you draw the same distinction between a police officer who is not expert at detecting the smell of methamphetamine and a police officer who is expert at detecting the smell of that drug?",

  "What is wrong with the state's argument that field performance records are not very probative because dogs detect odors, they don't detect the physical presence of the substance that created the odor, and therefore so-called false alerts, cases in which a search was performed and no contraband was found are not really cases of false alerts. What's wrong with that?",
  "Well, that may all be true, but then what -- what can one infer from the fact that a dog alerted a number of times when no contraband was found? I think what you just said was the explanation could be the dog detected an odor, but the substance wasn't there, or it could be that the dog was cued or the dog was confused or the dog is not very competent. So what can one infer from these field performance records?",
  "Well, excuse me. Where -- when nothing is found, how can you tell whether the dog alerted to a residual odor or simply made a mistake? Now, there may be cases where there is other evidence that suggests that drugs were present in that location, and, therefore, that is something from which you could infer that the dog was alerting to residual odor; but, the fact that you don't have evidence of that doesn't mean that there wasn't residual odor.",
  "Was that the holding in the Florida Supreme Court, that there was no probable cause because the dog alerted to the wrong part of the truck?",
  "Was it any part of their reasoning?",
  "Well, what would you think of this situation? Officers have a no-knock warrant, and they're -- they're at the house. They see somebody come out the door and start to go down the steps, doesn't look like that person has noticed their presence. Now, they have the choice, if you prevail, of either rushing in and stopping the person within the curtilage, in which case they could detain the person, or they could allow the person to walk some distance outside of the site of the house and then stop the person, and that would allow them to execute the warrant without endanger -- without enhancing the danger to them from potentially armed people inside or allowing the destruction of evidence. What -- in that situation, what argues in favor of your rule, that if they want to detain this individual, they have to rush in and stop him before he leaves the premises?",
  "Well, without interrupting -- in that situation, officer safety is undermined by your rule because it requires them to stop the person on the premises and, therefore, tip off those inside, potentially, about their presence.",
  "Could you explain what you mean by the immediate vicinity? Is it based on -- on property line? Is it some absolute distance from the - - the entrance to the premises? Is it based on how far you could see from the -- the site of the search?",
  "Well, what if the person comes out the door and walks -- and has walked 50 feet down the block within sight of the entrance at the time when the police are entering to make the arrest? Would that person be in the immediate vicinity?",
  "Well, does that mean that if the person is within sight of the entrance to the premises at the time when the police enter, then that person can be searched - -",
  "-- and be detained.",

  "You think the original understanding was that what happened in Summers was okay, but if you get out of the immediate vicinity, that's where they drew the line?",
  "If a court -- if this Court were to decide in a future case that effective assistance of counsel requires an attorney to advise the client of all collateral consequences, potential loss of a professional license, etc., would that be a rule that was dictated by precedent?",
  "Is it relevant that this is a coram nobis proceeding, rather than a habeas proceeding?",
  "On that question, before you -- not in relation to the Massaro argument, but in relation to the Teague argument, you think the rule in coram nobis is the same, that the Teague rule applies fully in coram nobis in the same way that it applies in habeas?",
  "Have we ever held that?",
  "Well, yes, I understand that, but the consequences of a retroactive application in coram nobis are more severe than they are in habeas, aren't they, because of the lack of a statute of limitations?",
  "You -- well, in -- under -- under the current Federal habeas statute, you have a rather short statute of limitations to file the habeas petition. Under coram nobis, if you prevail, then people who were -- who were convicted of offenses decades ago can raise the Padilla claim, can they not?",
  "What if someone -- if there is an attempt to -- a notice of removal for someone based on a conviction that occurred a long time ago, then that would be --",
  "In this case, why doesn't the question of probative value subsume the Daubert question?",
  "But if the problem is -- let me ask my question in a different way. If the problem is that the model that is being -- that was used by the expert does not fit the theory of liability that remains in the case, would that -- what is the difference in determining probative value there and determining whether it comes in under Daubert? I don't understand it.",
  "Well, before you do that, let me ask a question related to what Justice Kagan just asked. If we were to answer the question presented as reformulated, I take it your answer would be that a district court under those circumstances may not certify a class action; is that right?",
  "Well, then the only remaining question is whether the issue was in the case as a factual -- as a matter of the record here; isn't that right?",
  "Well, could this report be probative if it did not satisfy Daubert?",
  "If, in the middle of a trial, a judge grants a mistrial and says -- I'm sorry, grants an acquittal and says, I think that prompt prosecution is an element of the offense, and there wasn't prompt prosecution here. Now, could there be a re-prosecution in that situation?",
  "Even though the judge says he thinks that that's an element of the offense?",
  "Well, he saw a phantom element, and -- and that's what happened here, too, isn't it?",
  "And this -- and the fact that this was not a dwelling wasn't an element of the offense, either.",
  "Well, there -- that's a problem. But you're -- to come back to my earlier question, your -- what is your answer? Your answer is that, if the judge grants an acquittal based on the failure to prove anything that the judge thinks the prosecution has to prove, that's an acquittal. Is that fair?",
  "Well, to come back to the argument we just heard, so suppose the judge grants a mistrial for failure to prove an action within the statute of limitations, even though no statute of limitations defense was raised. Would that be -- would that be an acquittal?",
  "All right. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that it's not an element -- it's not really an element, but the judge thinks it's an element.",
  "If the judge -- if the judge simply misinterprets one of the elements, but doesn't add a new element, you say that there would be Double Jeopardy there, right?",
  "Isn't that going to be a very difficult line to draw?",
  "Let me give you an example. Suppose the -- a statute makes it a crime to burn down a dwelling, and the judge interprets dwelling to mean a building that is currently lived in and, therefore, not including a vacation home. And let's assume that's an incorrect interpretation. Now, is that an incorrect interpretation? Or is that the addition of a new element to the statute, namely, that it is a building in which people -- that's one element, and the other is people are currently living there?",
  "Well, I'm having trouble understanding how your argument would work. Let's say that the -- the defense calls a witness other than the defendant to testify to a conversation in which the defendant allegedly withdrew from the conspiracy and, by doing that, satisfies its burden of production. Now, you say the government has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, not only that this conversation didn't occur, but also, that the defendant never withdrew at any other time during the limitations period. Isn't that where your argument would lead?",
  "But how can they prove that he did not withdraw at any other time during this conspiracy?",
  "During the statute of limitations.",
  "Aren't you transforming the -- the nature of withdrawal? You are seeming to argue that the government has to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, active participation in the conspiracy during the statute of limitations period, rather than the -- the affirmative withdrawal from the conspiracy.",
  "Ms. Harrington, would you agree that, as this argument is developing, what is really at issue has less to do with the statute of limitations than the nature of conspiracy? And one view is Petitioners', and it's embodied in some of the questions that has been -- that have been asked, and it's this: That the crime is continuing to participate as a member of a conspiracy. And the other view is that a conspiracy is a dangerous thing. It's like rounding up a -- a pack of lions or wolves or setting loose some thing that continues to be a danger; and if you do that thing, by joining it, you are liable, criminally, for everything that happens after that, even if, at a certain point, you walk away, and you do nothing. Now, if -- if he's right, that it is active membership, then there may be a problem for you here. But if the other view is correct, that you are liable for setting this thing in motion, whether or not you continue to do anything active in support of it during the limitations period, then you are correct. Now, which is the -- which is the established view of the crime of conspiracy?",
  "I think the crux of your argument is that the government is going to have to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, active participation in the conspiracy during the statute of limitations period because it is impossible for the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that on no day, during a five-year period, did the defendant withdraw from the conspiracy. It simply can't be done. This person was under 24-hour video surveillance for the whole five-year period.",
  "And say what? That there was insufficient evidence to prove - -",
  "-- the opposite of what they have to prove?",
  "I thought you argue that every day, that there is -- that something has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt because the prosecution hasn't provided sufficient evidence?",
  "Couldn't you argue they have the burden of proving that the defendant did not withdraw during this five-year period? They have the burden of proving that. And did you hear any evidence from them that -- did you hear evidence disproving that -- that he didn't withdraw during that period? There is no evidence on that.",
  "You can make that argument?",
  "If the State --",
  "If a State legislature articulates clearly and expresses affirmatively that it wants municipalities to share the State's antitrust immunity, is that sufficient? Or is there a degree of specificity that's necessary as to the particular anticompetitive conduct that the State wants to cover?",
  "Well, Georgia does seem to have such a statute.",
  "Well, I don't want to take up your rebuttal time, but I don't see how that's consistent with your answer to Justice Kagan about a grant of discretionary authority.",
  "Well, could you explain what the materially augments rule means? Could you provide a definition of that? The authority to assign daily tasks has to be sufficient to do what?",
  "There are situations where the -- the assignment of responsibilities is extremely unpleasant, and so it's easy to see how the testimony would apply in that situation. But there are also a lot of situations, like the Chief Justice's example, where it's really very unclear. I don't know how courts are going to -- how courts can grapple with that.",
  "You said that being subjected to country music or hard rock or Wagner -- you know, every single day in the workplace would not be sufficient. I don't know. Some people might think that it was -- that that is.",
  "What was the most unpleasant thing that Davis could have assigned the Petitioner to do? Maybe chopping onions all day, every day?",
  "But that would materially augment? Chopping onions all day would be enough?",
  "Chopping -- how about chopping other things, just chopping? You are the sous-chef, you are going to be chopping all day every day. Would that be enough?",
  "Well, isn't cleaning the toilets a limited -- isn't the authority to decide who cleans the toilets the same as the authority to decide what the music is going to be? It's one thing. I thought -- and your answer on the music was, well, that probably wouldn't count because it's the authority to decide just one thing.",
  "But your argument is if the only authority was to decide who cleans the toilets, then -- then that would not -- that wouldn't count, because that's just one thing.",
  "Well, that can't possibly be what the case means. Suppose that it's -- it's the assignment of offices, and all of the offices except one have heating and air conditioning, but one has no heating and no air conditioning. And so -- and that's the only authority that this person has is to assign desks. That person says, if you don't do whatever it is that I want you to do, I'm putting you in the office where there's no heating, and there's no air conditioning. And you would say that doesn't count because it's just one thing. It's not a broad range of authorities -- of authorities.",
  "The conclusion in your brief is that the judgment of the court of appeals should be vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings, and now -- now you are telling us that we should -- we should basically write an opinion on summary judgment.",
  "We took this case to decide whether the Faragher and Ellerth -- and Ellerth supervisory liability rule is limited to those harassers who have the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline their victim. And your answer to that is no; is that right?",
  "All right. Well, if we -- if we agree with that without having any party defending the rule that was adopted by three circuits, then surely -- well, then, why shouldn't we just remand this case for the lower courts to decide this, this summary judgment issue, and -- and permit further development of the record if the record isn't fully developed?",
  "I understand Mr. Ortiz to say that there's at least a dispute of fact about whether Davis could have controlled what Petitioner did on a daily basis.",
  "Doesn't her job description say that she can assign tasks in the kitchen?",
  "What guidance would your -- what guidance would the kind of opinion that you're suggesting we write really provide? The -- the guidance would be that if someone has no authority to assign daily work, then that person isn't -- and also has no authority to hire, fire, promote, et cetera, then that person isn't a supervisor. How much guidance is that?",
  "If you were willing to concede that this would be a close case under the Second Circuit standard or under the EEOC guidance, then there might be an argument in favor of our applying those tests -- or one of those tests to the facts of the case, because then that might provide some guidance, even though we are supposed to be a court of review, not a court of first view. But you're saying this is an extremely weak case under those standards; and, therefore, what is -- what benefit is there in our applying this? Just send it back and have it done in the normal course by the court of appeals or by the district court.",
  "Are you, in effect, asking for a windfall because Mr. McCutchen and his attorneys didn't understand what ERISA means in this context? If they understood that things would work out the way you think they should work out and they saw that the limits of the insurance policies against which they could collect were $110,000, wouldn't they have realized that this was a suit that wasn't worth pursuing? There would be no point in doing it because nothing would be -- nothing would be gained for Mr. McCutchen or for the attorneys.",
  "Well, perhaps they should have realized it. But, if they realized it, they have no incentive to pursue this litigation or to pursue the tort decision --",
  "May I ask you what you think is the purpose of the Plain-Error Rule? Suppose that it was proposed to amend Rule 52(b) to take out the word \"plain,\" so that the rule would read simply, \"an error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the Court's attention.\" So what does -- in your judgment, what does the word \"plain\" add? What -- what purposes does it serve?",
  "But what purpose does it serve? Why should the rule not be that if -- if some -- if there was an error, and it was a really -- it was an error that really badly hurt the defendant, then it can be considered, even though it wasn't raised at whatever time it has to have been -- it wasn't raised, there wasn't an objection? What purpose does that serve?",
  "Well, but I'm not asking why we have -- why we permit plain errors to be raised. I'm asking why do we require that the error be plain in order for it to be considered? Let me suggest two purposes it serves. It follows from the adversary system, and it serves judicial efficiency. Would you agree with that; those are the purposes of it?",
  "All right. Does it serve those purposes better as applied at the time of trial or at the time of appeal?",
  "Yes.",
  "Does it serve -- does it serve judicial efficiency better to say that we apply the Plain-Error Rule at the time of trial or at the time of appeal?",
  "Well, if you apply it at the time of trial, it may -- eliminate the need for an appellate court, under some circumstances, to get to the ultimate question of whether there was error; or, it could say, there might have been error, but it wasn't -- it's not plain to us, I suppose. So you have that efficiency. But if you apply it at the time of trial, you avoid retrials. So which is -- which of those two is more consistent with the purpose of serving judicial efficiency?",
  "Then let me ask you this question. Counsel, then let me ask you this related question. Something happens at trial. There isn't an objection. It goes up on appeal. And the -- the appellate court, there is an argument about whether it's a plain error or not. And the appellate court says, first of all, we think it was an error, but it's a -- it was a close question. We had trouble with this. So it wasn't plain, and, therefore, this defendant is out of luck. What's the justification for that?",
  "No, I mean in real world terms. What -- what purpose is served by that? If the court has concluded that there was an error, and it affected substantial rights, but it wasn't plain, what -- what justification is there for saying, that's too bad? You know, you really got hurt, but it wasn't clear until -- you know, it wasn't plain until we decided this case, so go back to prison. What's the purpose for that?",
  "Then why should it have to be plain at the time of appeal?",
  "You could promote efficiency at the appellate stage by having a rule like the rule that we have in qualified immunity cases, which gives a court the discretion to decide whether something was clear or go to the -- to the merits of the -- of the argument. You could -- that's -- you can serve efficiency by having that. But the Plain-Error Rule doesn't do that. In the situation I gave you, the court would say there was an error, it really affected your substantial rights, but we can't say it was plain to us until we decided this case, and, therefore, you get no relief. And -- and maybe there's a reason for that. I'm waiting for you to tell me what the reason for it is.",
  "What about Mr. Henderson sitting in prison, serving a sentence that we now know was imposed for a reason that is not permitted under Federal sentencing law? Is there anything that can be done for him? If -- if it was very clear at the time that the statute prohibited this, would it have been -- was it ineffective assistance of counsel for his attorney not to have made an objection?",
  "Well, what do you --",
  "Does the -- can I ask this question? Does the district court have the authority when an offer of judgment is made to hold a hearing as to whether the offer of judgment actually gives the plaintiff everything that the plaintiff could possibly get under the complaint?",
  "But where -- where does it say that in Rule 68?",
  "What is it under?",
  "If I were to -- I'm sorry. If I were to think that the individual plaintiff's claim isn't moot until a judgment is entered into her favor, but that -- but that -- that issue, was not preserved, can you give me an analog that I should think about, with respect to the second question?",
  "Should I -- yes.",
  "Well, should I assume that this is the same -- the case would then be the same as if a default judgment had been entered in your favor for that amount?",
  "Now, you refer to these -- to the providers as sophisticated, and that certainly is true. But are they really in a position to double-check the calculation when -- if it were true -- and I know you don't agree with this -- if it were true that information needed to make the calculation was intentionally withheld, concealed?",
  "Well, I understand that. But if that were the case, would their sophistication allow them to double-check this? Or is this just something that is dependent on data that they cannot access?",
  "Wouldn't the Alabama --",
  "What if the Alabama courts were to conduct a custody proceeding? Since the child has now been in Scotland for over a year, would they consider the child's habitual residence to be Scotland?",
  "And if they did that, wouldn't they defer to the Scottish courts for custody determination?",
  "Well, if you -- if you could take an appeal and got a reversal of the decision -- of the order removing the child to -- allowing the child to be removed to Scotland, wouldn't that undermine the -- the judgment for costs? I don't understand why that would be a separate order -- why that would be something that has to be appealed separately. Why wouldn't that be included with the final order in the case?",
  "Well, then you seem to be saying that if the -- if the law does not permit the issuance of a particular kind of order, and that's what the -- THE plaintiff is seeking -- or that's what the appellant is seeking, then the case is moot. Is that your argument? I thought that's a merits question, not a mootness question.",
  "Well, if I understand your answer to Justice Kagan, your argument is dependent on the proposition that, under the Convention, that once the child has left this country, a U.S. court no longer has any power to order the child to come back; is that right?",
  "And I don't see where that was decided, either by the court in this case or in the Beckier case that the Eleventh Circuit panel here cited. There is no discussion in either of those opinions of the -- how the Convention -- what the Convention says on this question.",
  "No, no. This is not a -- this is not a question about our general standard of mootness. This is a question of the meaning of the Convention. As I understood your argument to Justice Kagan, your position is dependent on a particular interpretation of the Convention. And I don't see any discussion of that interpretive issue in either of those opinions.",
  "If the -- if the Convention said explicitly that a court in this country or whatever other sending countries involved could order the child back, this case would not be moot; is that correct?",
  "And you -- but you say that the Convention, in effect, says exactly the opposite; once the child leaves, there can't be an order requiring their return.",
  "Is there a difference between what you're --",
  "Is there a difference between what you are advocating and the approach that's now taken in the General Removal Statute as it's been amended recently under 1446(c)(2)? So there as I read it, the amount demanded in the complaint is not necessarily controlling. A case can be removed even if the amount demanded in the complaint is below the jurisdictional threshold and then the defendant can prove that the real amount involved exceeds the jurisdictional threshold.",
  "Even if this case were handled on remand to the Arkansas Supreme Court exactly like a Federal class action, I don't understand how absent class members would ever be able to -- to determine whether by failing to opt out, they had compromised part of their claim. I don't see how, even if they're notified that there's a $5 million cap -- and I don't know that Rule 23 requires that, but suppose they're notified of that. They can't tell whether, by remaining a member of the class, their claim is going to be compromised at all. It would depend on lots of different things, including how many members are in the class after it's certified. And that's something they can't know.",
  "Under your argument, the amount that's demanded seems to be totally meaningless. Here, we are told that the real amount is only slightly above the $5 million figure, but I don't think that makes any difference. So let's say that what was -- you stipulate you are not going to get more than $5 million, but really the value of the claim is $50 million. And you say that's perfectly okay. It will be dealt with later when the case is -- after the case has been remanded to the -- to the State courts. Isn't that right? So the $5 million is just -- just means nothing.",
  "In practical terms.",
  "Okay. But does that matter? We assume, I think, that the real amount is a little bit over $5 million. Suppose the real amount is 6 million or 7 million, 8 million, does it matter where along that continuum the real amount falls?",
  "Suppose this were an individual action, and the amount is -- the amount is pled -- an individual diversity action -- and the amount that is pled is under $75,000. The defendant still can remove the case and prove that the amount is really higher than that because the practice of the State in question is to allow a recovery that is over $75,000. So why shouldn't the same approach apply here?",
  "Wouldn't it be perverse if the rule were that in an individual action where a plaintiff is simply stipulating how much he or she is demanding -- individually -- which the person can do, it's possible to look behind that number. But in a class action where the named Plaintiff is purporting to make a stipulation on behalf of absent class members as to whom the named plaintiff at that point has absolutely no authority, you can't look behind the number --",
  "Well, the California Supreme Court has said that an element of the burglary statute is the violation of some possessory interest. Now, I know there is some disagreement between you and the government about that. But assuming for the sake of argument that that is an element, one way for the California court to express that is to say simply, as it has, that an element is the violation of the possessory interest. Another way of saying exactly the same thing would be to say that the term \"enters\" under the California burglary statute means either breaking into a structure or the violation of the possessory interest in some other way.",
  "Those are exactly equivalent. Now, if they were to say the latter, would a conviction under this statute potentially qualify under the Armed Career Criminal Act?",
  "No, but they -- they set out alternative elements, either breaking into the structure or the violation of the possessory interest in some other way.",
  "No, but they have said -- do you dispute the fact that saying A, an element is the violation of the possessory interest, and B, the elements are breaking or the violation of the possessory interest in some other way, are exactly the same substantively?",
  "I thought your argument was that if the terms of the statute set out alternative ways of satisfying an element, you have alternative elements in essence, that then, even if some of those alternatives don't fall within generic burglary, if one does, then a conviction under that statute potentially can qualify.",
  "Isn't that -- do you not --",
  "Okay.",
  "Alright. Now, what if the State Supreme Court says exactly the same thing? Your answer to Justice Ginsburg was it doesn't matter whether the elements are set out in the statute or whether they are defined by the State court.",
  "Well, I'll ask the question one more time. Is there a difference -- what the California court has said is that an element is the violation of a possessory interest. Assuming for the sake of argument that is correct, that is a correct statement of California law, is there any substantive difference between saying that and saying the element is breaking or, in the alternative, the violation of a possessory interest in some other way? Is there some substantive difference between those two things?",
  "But your argument comes back to how the elements are defined. It comes back -- so in your view, what is critical is in a case of a broad statute -- whether the statute simply sets out a broad category or whether it sets out lots of subcategories, that's what your argument comes down to. If the court says -- if the California legislature or the California court says, the element is entry, period, that's one thing. If they say the element is breaking or entering in some other way, that's something entirely different. It all comes down to that, in your view.",
  "Well, if that's your argument, then you're really asking for us to modify our prior cases. Because I thought it was clear, that if the element -- if the statute requires -- if to qualify under ACCA, you have to have a gun. And the statute says that you have to have a weapon, and a weapon is defined as a gun, a knife, or a hatchet, that would be okay. Is that wrong? Isn't that your -- don't you agree with that?",
  "So your answer to Justice Breyer was not yes; it was no.",
  "What seems to me perhaps clearest about this case and others is that this modified categorical approach has turned out to be extremely complicated, and occasionally produces results that seem to make no sense whatsoever. Was this inevitable? Is this really what Congress intended, or did the Court create this problem by the way it has interpreted ACCA?",
  "Well, does the offense of burglary have the element of using force or threatening to use of force?",
  "So the element doesn't -- the element language doesn't apply to burglary.",
  "Well I have the same question that Justice Kennedy just asked? What if a claim could have reasonably been discovered by a government agency if it had more resources, but given the resources that it had it couldn't have reasonably discovered the claim? Would the discovery rule apply there?",
  "What if this case is tried to a verdict and there is a special verdict and the jury says that 10 percent was medical expenses? Would the -- the statute would override that?",
  "What's the difference between that case and Ahlborn, where you have -- where the State has agreed that a certain amount is attributable for medical expenses, and then this hypothetical that the jury has determined that a certain amount constitutes medical expenses? What's the difference between those two?",
  "Isn't the reasoning of Ahlborn that when we know to a certainty how much the medical expenses were and what -- what part of the judgment this represents or the settlement represents medical expenses, then only that much can be assigned to the government? And I don't see the difference between that and the verdict situation.",
  "Could I ask you how often this comes up in North Carolina? Do you have any figures where you have a dispute of this nature, during the course of a year?",
  "Well, how is this allocation not happening?",
  "Well, this is what I envision happening, if the -- if the parties can't -- if the State and the -- and the recipient of the -- of Medicaid assistance can't come to an agreement. Basically, you have to make an estimate of what the damages would have been if the case had been tried and then you determine that the medical portion of the damages would have been 15 percent and so you reduce, then you take the amount of the settlement, and the amount of the settlement that is attributable to the medical expenses is 15 percent. That would be what I would envision. Is that not correct?",
  "That seems very -- that seems really very complicated.",
  "How can a judge -- where the case is settled and the judge doesn't really know anything about the proof, how is a judge going to be in a position really to do that?",
  "Could I ask you a question on this different point? Could the -- suppose the North Carolina legislature passed a statute that says something like the following: \"In any tort action in which an item of damages sought is medical expenses, the plaintiff may not recover for any other item of damages until the full amount of the medical expenses is satisfied.\" Now, there they're just restructuring their tort law. Would there be a problem with that?",
  "Does Federal law -- did Federal law require your client to seek compensation for medical expenses?",
  "So you could have -- could you have filed suit and disclaimed any -- any claim for medical expenses, you only want to be compensated for other things?",
  "Jurisdictions have an incentive to get a warrant, I would think. Even if they -- even if we were to say that they don't need one, they certainly have a strong incentive to get warrants because it insulates the search to a much greater degree from later challenge -- at a suppression hearing. So why shouldn't it depend on the practicalities in a particular jurisdiction? Not every jurisdiction has prosecutors and judges who are staying up at -- you know, 3:00 o'clock in the morning on Sunday morning waiting for the phone to ring or for -- to receive some sort of an electronic message that there has been a stop and somebody wants a -- wants a search warrant. Maybe -- you know, big jurisdictions can do that, but small ones can't. So why -- but if you are in a big jurisdiction that -- or one that feels that they can afford that, then why should -- you know, why should the Fourth Amendment permit the search to take place without the warrant when it could have been obtained practically --",
  "What if the State has a form; we have some forms in the Joint Appendix. What if it has a form for the officer to fill out? He checks certain boxes, and then you send this electronically to a magistrate, and if the right boxes are checked, the magistrate will grant the warrant. Is that -- do you think that is consistent with the Fourth Amendment?",
  "Suppose you are in a rural -- in a rural jurisdiction and it takes a long time to rouse a prosecutor and a magistrate at 3:00 in the morning to get the warrant. You would say, that's too bad, everybody has -- the whole country has to operate like New York City, you have to have somebody on duty all the time.",
  "But I'm asking you a hypothetical question. I -- I bet there are places like that. I have encountered magistrate -- Federal magistrate judges who were unreceptive to receiving warrant applications in the middle of the night, and that is known to -- to exist. Suppose you have a jurisdiction like that? Does that count as a circumstance that would justify a warrantless taking of blood?",
  "That's not true because there's a great advantage to the prosecution in having a search with a warrant as opposed to a warrantless search in terms of suppression; isn't that correct?",
  "Can I ask you this question? How much blood has to be taken in order to test for blood alcohol? What if medical technology advances to -- I gather it's a -- it's a substantial amount. But what if it advances to the point that you don't need any more blood than you need now to test blood sugar, and you just have a little machine that makes a tiny prick in somebody's finger and you've got enough blood to do a blood alcohol test. Does it change then?",
  "Well, if they had sent more police officers to the scene, they could have done everything faster.",
  "If they had sent more police officers to the scene of the accident, if they -- then they could have done it faster.",
  "So what's the difference between that practical limitation and the limitation that exists in a world -- in a rural jurisdiction?",
  "(B)(4) is about -- (b)(4) is about very sensitive information. You're talking about people's Social Security numbers. You're talking about whether the person has a disability that they may not want to disclose to the general public -- a person has Parkinson's or -- or epilepsy or is diabetic. And so you're just -- you're saying lawyers, they -- they get all that stuff. Nobody else can, but lawyers are a privileged class, and they get it.",
  "Well, if Congress wanted to draw the line between possible -- you know, some unknown lawsuit and an actual lawsuit that's in the mind of the lawyer, why did it use the term \"litigation,\" when it had already used earlier, in the same subsection, \"proceeding,\" civil, criminal, administrative, or arbitral proceeding?",
  "But isn't your position that a decision of this Court is not entitled to stare decisis protection, if there isn't a majority opinion in that case?",
  "Well, I can think of some pretty important decisions of this Court that were not the result of a majority opinion. Do you want us to adopt that as a blanket rule?",
  "All right. Constitutional decisions of this Court not decided with the majority opinion, no stare decisis effect. That's your argument?",
  "Well, I think it's important for this Court to have a consistent doctrine of stare decisis. The doctrine can't be, \"We will overrule decisions that we don't like, but we will stick with decisions that the majority does like.\" So I'm still looking for your understanding of what stare decisis means in constitutional cases. Now, with the suggestion of Justice Ginsburg, I gather that your position is, if it's a narrow decision, then it's -- stare decisis has less weight; is that it? Now, what other factors? So it has less weight. Why isn't it controlling, though? Why does it have insufficient weight here?",
  "Now, if you were defending a case involving drug weight and your client maintained that he or she had nothing to do with these drugs, how would you proceed? Your argument would be: They're not my drugs, but if they were my drugs, they weren't - - they didn't weigh more than one kilo.",
  "Why is Booker -- why is Booker entitled to greater stare decisis weight than Harris and McMillan?",
  "Isn't it true that you waited three years before doing that?",
  "If we provide -- if we provide that guidance, what do we do about the continuances that Mr. Lorenzi requested that relate to the funding? \"January 10, 2003, Lorenzi requests a continuance of funding hearing, citing scheduling problems.\" \"August 5, 2003, Lorenzi moves to continue hearing on motion to designate source of funds so that the Indigent Defender Board can consider funding Boyer's case at an August 26 meeting.\" So this is -- okay. \"Lorenzi moves to continue September 12, 2003. Lorenzi moves to continue hearing on motion to designate funds in trial, so that the IDB may, again, consider the funding defense at its next meeting. December 15, Lorenzi moves to continue hearing on motion to designate funds,\" et cetera. There are many of these motions. What do we do with those?",
  "Let me -- let me give you a holding -- this is an incredibly factually complicated case. We don't usually take cases that are so fact-bound, but we've taken it.",
  "Let me give you a rule that we might adopt. If the failure to provide funding makes it impossible for some period of time for a case to be tried, then the delay is attributable to the State. Would you agree with that?",
  "Well, you agreed with the -- the principle that I mentioned, except that you want to draw a distinction between the failure to provide funding and the deliberate failure to provide funding? Is that a real difference?",
  "Can the State inadvertently failed to provide funding?",
  "Well, let's say you have a case where the -- the defendant wants counsel, can't afford counsel, and the State says, we'd love to provide counsel for you, but we're broke, we just don't have any money to provide counsel, but, maybe in a year, we'll have money to provide counsel. Now, what do we do with the delay between that point and -- and the -- the point, a year later, when the money becomes available?",
  "Well, maybe we could address this in slightly more concrete terms. You have two -- two situations. In one case, a Federal employee who's driving a car deliberately runs somebody down. And, in the second case, a government doctor grabs somebody who doesn't want an operation and performs the operation anyway. Now, as -- under your reading, there would -- there would be a claim against the government in the second situation, but not in the first situation; is that right?",
  "Why would Congress want that?",
  "Now, the government has an alternative interpretation, and I know you think it's wrong. But would you go further and say that it's not a plausible interpretation?",
  "But was the interpretation adopted by the district court and by the Ninth Circuit, but you still say is implausible.",
  "I'm trying to understand what would be -- what would be left of Nollan and Dolan, if we agree with you. Let me give you three situations. First, the petition -- the district says, we are granting your permit on the condition that you give us one-third of your land. That's Nollan and Dolan, right?",
  "Okay. Situation number 2, permit is denied, but it will be granted, if you give us one-third of your land. What about that?",
  "Is that the same as the first example, for purposes of Nollan and Dolan?",
  "All right. Now let me to get to my third. The permit is denied, but it will be granted, if you give us the fair market value of the third of the land, and, once you have done that, then we're going to condemn your land and pay you the fair market value for it.",
  "Well, you may be right, but you are making Nollan and Dolan a trap only for really stupid districts -- you know, if they -- they say the right words and then they are out from under it; isn't that right?",
  "Well, why should it matter whether the -- whether the permitting authority says expressly in the denial, \"It's denied because you didn't do this,\" or it just says, \"It's denied,\" but it's perfectly well understood what was needed -- what they were going to demand in order to get it.",
  "Well, why isn't that significant? Doesn't that manifest Congress's view that -- that -- that this is -- that this is a complicated specialty area? And so there would be, arguably, a special reason for having these cases, cases that involve a patent issue, in Federal court, rather than State court?",
  "Well, I have the same questions that my colleagues have asked. Could you give us, in a sentence or two, the test that you would like us to apply? Where a State does not, like Arizona, prohibit the raising of this issue on direct appeal, Martinez, nevertheless, applies where the State does blank. Fill in the blank.",
  "Impracticable, in the vast majority of cases. Now, that really would require a case-by-case determination in every other State that doesn't fall within the Martinez category, wouldn't it?",
  "No?",
  "Well, I understand that. But -- so -- so if the State says, you have to raise this on direct appeal, but you have to comply with our time limits on direct appeal. And they don't appoint -- you know, you don't get a new -- you don't get a new attorney on direct appeal. It's the same attorney who represented you at trial. So that attorney is in the position of arguing that he or she was ineffective at trial. And that would be okay?",
  "You have to raise it on direct appeal or it's lost. You can't wait until collateral -- until the collateral proceeding, and, by the way, you don't get a new attorney. You get the same attorney that represented you at trial. Would that be all right?",
  "All right. So you have the same system where you get a new attorney, but you have to comply with the time limits.",
  "And then you say, well, I can't do all of this social background research that Wiggins requires within the time limits, so that's impracticable. Is that State okay?",
  "That's not okay, either.",
  "So the reason why -- the reason why there was a movement to channel ineffective assistance of counsel claims to collateral review is that it is often -- maybe in the great majority of cases -- impracticable to adjudicate them on direct appeal. So, under your standard, it seems to me that covers every State.",
  "Well, let me try this one more time. You -- you seem to say, in your brief, that the Kansas procedure and the -- the Michigan procedure take those States outside of the Martinez category; is that correct?",
  "All right. Now, as I understand the procedure in those cases, it is the following: On direct appeal, the attorney can make a motion for a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel, and, if some threshold is met, the appellate court can remand the case to the trial court for a hearing on ineffective assistance. Is that correct?",
  "Okay. And that would -- in most of those cases, the attorney on direct appeal is going to be the attorney who represented the defendant at trial and is probably not going to be in a very good position to argue that he or she was ineffective at trial, but that would still be okay?",
  "And if you don't do that, you've lost it.",
  "That was a case in which -- that was the case in which the Court unwisely reversed a certain Third Circuit decision.",
  "The Respondent says that the Kansas and the Michigan procedures are sufficient to take the case -- to take the States outside of Martinez. You say your stay and abate proceeding is the same, essentially, as those procedures. His response is that Texas has used this remedy in only one situation, and that is when a defendant is deprived of counsel during the new trial window and suffers prejudice from the deprivation. Now, is that correct.",
  "I have some difficulty understanding what the Sixth Circuit was doing. And maybe you can help me with that. The district court, as I understand it, said to the Petitioner, you lose for two reasons. First, you don't really have evidence of actual innocence, not enough anyway; and, second -- and I can understand that, because the evidence -- well, that -- the most that is suggested by the affidavits is that Jones was a participant in this murder, not that Perkins was not responsible for the murder. But, anyway, so you lose for two reasons. First, you don't really have evidence of actual innocence; second, you weren't diligent. The Sixth Circuit grants a certificate of appealability only on the issue of diligence, and they say, diligence doesn't make any difference. Well, where does that leave the petitioner? He's already lost on the question of whether there's evidence of actual innocence, and there was no appeal on that issue.",
  "Well, that -- that may be what they're contemplating, but they can't get to the issue of whether the district court adequately addressed the issue of adequate innocence -- of actual innocence, unless that issue is before them. And the issue isn't supposed to be before them, unless -- isn't before them, unless the certificate of appealability was issued, and there was no certificate of appealability on that issue.",
  "Well, I don't understand that. The district court -- or you seem to suggest the district court was wrong in saying that there wasn't sufficient evidence for an actual innocence claim. Maybe that's the case. Maybe it was wrong. But, if it decided that issue and the issue wasn't appealed, then the issue is settled. And that's the problem that I see. Now, how do you get around that?",
  "Did you ask for a certificate -- what other issues did you ask for a certificate of appealability on?",
  "What -- what other issues did he ask for a certificate on?",
  "Well, you are asking for what is, potentially, a very big exception to the 1-year statute of limitations. If you took a poll of all of the prisoners in Michigan, how many of them do you think would say they are actually innocent?",
  "\"Very few\" would say they are actually innocent?",
  "Oh, \"credibly say.\" But how many would say that they are actually innocent? A lot. And a lot would be able to come up with evidence that is equal to -- to what the petition -- what the Respondent here has come up with. Now, do you think it's -- it's plausible that Congress, in establishing this new 1-year statute of limitations, because it doesn't want these things to drag on indefinitely, intended to create an exemption that broad, so that anybody who claims to be actually innocent can at least get over -- can get to the point where the Court has to decide whether the -- has to weigh this evidence of actual innocence, to see whether it -- it gets over the threshold?",
  "Is that plausible, given what Congress was trying to do in AEDPA?",
  "But that's very odd because, if you have somebody who's actually innocent, then you're saying that person can't get out of prison, unless the person happens to have a good constitutional claim that's totally unrelated to the fact that the person is actually innocent. That's just very odd, isn't it.",
  "Well, assuming for the sake of argument that there is this exception, why shouldn't diligence be required? How can it be equitable to allow someone to bring a claim when the person has -- involving new evidence, when the person has not been diligent in presenting this new evidence to the court?",
  "Well, as your -- as your adversary says, there's nothing really procedurally complicated about filing a Federal habeas. There -- there are forms -- I've read hundreds of them -- that have been filed by pro se petitioners, and there is nothing technical about claiming, \"I'm innocent of this offense.\" This isn't a legal issue. It's something anybody can understand. I've got an -- I've got my sister's affidavit, I have an affidavit by a third person, I have an affidavit by -- by a person who worked in the dry cleaning shop that shows that I'm actually innocent. Why doesn't -- what is the reason for waiting 5 years to file that?",
  "But I just -- I don't understand your answer about why it took him 5 years from the -- from obtaining the last affidavit to the filing of the Federal habeas. You said he couldn't get a lawyer. He really didn't need a lawyer to do this. He didn't have access to a library. This isn't a legal issue -- isn't a complicated legal issue. It's a factual issue, that anybody who watches detective shows on TV can understand.",
  "But you think that Congress, which, in AEDPA, was trying to speed all this up and get rid of the delay and make things simpler, intended to allow that? You could wait 5 years, you could wait 10 years, you could wait 15 years; it doesn't matter? That's what AEDPA was intended to do?",
  "Well, before you get on to -- before you go to that, fingerprints have been taken, I believe, from people who are booked for offenses for many, many, many years; isn't that right?",
  "When did -- when did the FBI's AFIS system for comparing fingerprints by computer begin?",
  "Well, the question that I had was this: If the constitutionality of taking fingerprints is dependent on the speed with which a fingerprint comparison can be done now by a computerized system, would that mean that the taking of fingerprints was unconstitutional back in, let's say, the '50s, when that wasn't possible, and fingerprints could only be compared manually?",
  "Well, do you think the intrusion is worse when you just take a swab and you go inside somebody's cheek, as opposed to rolling fingerprints? Which is the greater intrusion?",
  "Which is --",
  "Well, the thrust of a lot of what we -- we have been presented with in the briefs and what we have heard this morning -- and, by the way, I think this is perhaps the most important criminal procedure case that this Court has heard in decades. The -- the attorney for the State began by listing a number of crimes just in Maryland that had been solved using this. So this is what is at stake: Lots of murders, lots of rapes that can be -- that can be solved using this new technology that involves a very minimal intrusion on personal privacy. But why isn't this the fingerprinting of the 21st century? What is the difference? If it was permissible and it's been -- it's been assumed to be so for decades, that it is permissible to fingerprint anybody who's booked, why is it not permissible to take a DNA sample from anybody who is arrested?",
  "Well, as to -- as to the first, in our cases involving searches for -- where a urine sample is taken to determine drug use, the urine can be analyzed for all sorts of things besides the presence of drugs, and the Court has said, in those cases, we are only going to consider that -- we are considering that this is a reasonable search with respect to the determination of whether the person has taken drugs, not all the other information --",
  "-- that might be obtained from it.",
  "What was the purpose of fingerprinting before it was possible to make fingerprint comparisons by computer?",
  "Well, I would assume that, before it was possible to do computer searches, the way in which fingerprinting established identification, what it did in that respect was to identify the person arrested on this occasion, so that, if the person was arrested again, then the police would know that it was the same person. There was no way of -- no practicable way of taking the fingerprints of somebody who was booked and determining whether that person -- you didn't have anything to compare it to. And they certainly -- you couldn't do it manually.",
  "Yes, so you know that, on day one, you have arrested -- you've arrested Mr. X, and then, a year later, you arrest somebody else, and you know it's Mr. X again. And DNA can do exactly the same thing, except more accurately.",
  "What if someone has a bloody shirt and throws it away in the trash -- in a public trash can along the street, you are saying that the police can't analyze that without a search warrant?",
  "But your client was convicted of the offense of arrest.",
  "And it was a serious offense, punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment.",
  "Isn't that correct? And he was sentenced to 4 years.",
  "For Fourth Amendment purposes -- for Fourth Amendment purposes, do you think that it is -- that it is permissible to take a DNA sample from someone who is convicted of an offense that would qualify as a felony under common law?",
  "Well, let's say you prevail, and the case is remanded for resentencing. Is there anything that would prevent the district court from saying -- you know, before the promulgation of the new guidelines, I thought the range in the old guidelines was about right for this offense. But, now that I've seen the new guidelines, I think that those really fit best under the factors that I have to consider under the statute in determining the correct sentence, so I'm going to reimpose exactly the same sentence, not because it's required by the guidelines, in fact, I'm going to go outside the guidelines. I just think, with the enlightenment that the new guidelines have provided me, that that's the best sentence. Now, would that be -- would there be an ex post facto problem there?",
  "What if the -- what if the statistics showed that nationwide only -- let's say, 25 percent of defendants were being sentenced within the guideline range; would that change your argument?",
  "Well, I think there's a fair chance that, as time goes by --",
  "-- we're going to see fewer and fewer sentences within the guidelines. As judges who began their careers during the guidelines, the mandatory guidelines era, leave the bench, new judges come in who never had to deal with the mandatory guidelines, I think we're going to see fewer and fewer guidelines sentences. And -- and the percentages in some districts are -- are really quite striking. I'm told that, in the Southern District -- or the Eastern District of New York, now, only 30 percent of the defendants receive within-guidelines sentences. So --",
  "Well, when I was on the court of appeals we thought it was our responsibility to ensure that the district courts were complying with the Sentencing Reform Act. That might not have been true across the river, but --",
  "Let's say this case comes back in 20 years and the statistics show that -- only a distinct minority of defendants are being sentenced within the guidelines; would the case come out differently?",
  "Do you -- do you know what the statistics are as to the number of below-guidelines sentences each year that are reversed by the courts of appeals on the ground that they are not reasonable?",
  "Yes. I mean, I'm told that it's in the single digits.",
  "Do you think the nature of their underlying -- their antitrust claim is relevant to this? They are claiming that they were unlawfully compelled to enter into the contract that they say, as a practical matter, precludes them from raising the antitrust issue. Does that -- does it matter?",
  "Suppose Congress passed a law that said, everyone whose last name begins with A shall pay a special tax of $1,000 a year. And let's say that tax is challenged by somebody whose last name begins with A. Would it be a defense to that challenge that for some reason this particular person really should pay a $1,000 penalty that people with a different last name do not pay?",
  "Well, there's no question that --",
  "There's no question --",
  "There is no question that the Voting Rights Act has done enormous good. It's one of the most successful statutes that Congress passed during the twentieth century and one could probably go farther than that. But when Congress decided to reauthorize it in 2006, why wasn't it incumbent on Congress under the congruence and proportionality standard to make a new determination of coverage? Maybe the whole country should be covered. Or maybe certain parts of the country should be covered based on a formula that is grounded in up-to-date statistics. But why -- why wasn't that required by the congruence and proportionality standards? Suppose that Congress in 1965 had based the coverage formula on voting statistics from 1919, 46 years earlier. Do you think Katzenbach would have come out the same way?",
  "Then why shouldn't it apply everywhere in the country?",
  "Well, you do really think there was -- that the record in 2006 supports the proposition that -- let's just take the question of changing the location of polling places. That's a bigger problem in Virginia than in Tennessee, or it's a bigger problem in Arizona than Nevada, or in the Bronx as opposed to Brooklyn.",
  "Well, the statistics that I have before me show that in, let's say the 5 years prior to reauthorization, the gap between success in Section 2 suits in the covered and the non-covered jurisdiction narrowed and eventually was eliminated. Do you disagree with that?",
  "Before your time expires, I would like to make sure I understand your position on this as-applied versus facial issue. Is it your position that this would be a different case if it were brought by, let's say, a county in Alaska as opposed to Shelby County, Alabama?",
  "Well, Section 5 -- the Section 5 activity may show that there's a problem in the jurisdictions covered by Section 5, but it says nothing about the presence or absence of similar problems in noncovered jurisdictions, isn't that right?",
  "All right.",
  "Well, before we get to the various candidates for applicable mental state, if there is one, could you tell me what this mental state applies to? Does it apply to facts or does it apply to law?",
  "You think recklessness is required?",
  "You think recklessness is required?",
  "Recklessness as to the law, as to what the law requires of the trustee.",
  "But the question here -- the question here is not whether the trustee is liable. Yes, the trustee is liable. The question is whether it's dischargeable.",
  "And if you look at the other, the other words in this list, fraud, embezzlement, larceny, those are -- those are bad acts. There is a degree of moral culpability involved and maybe there are people who commit fraud, embezzlement and larceny and don't realize that it's illegal, but there are not many. It's commonly understood that those are bad. So in a very impressionistic sense, there is a difference between that and the kind of conduct that's presented to us here. But you think that's irrelevant.",
  "Well, what about a reasonable trustee who just invests very imprudently, an unreasonable trustee who invests very imprudently? Any reasonable trustee would realize that investing in -- you know, the widget factory totally unrelated to him is a really bad idea and money is lost there. What about that trustee? Is that a defalcation.",
  "Could you explain what you mean, before your time expires, in footnote 18? I understood your argument until I got there, but then you said that there was no particular mental state required. And then in footnote 18 you said, well, there may be cases where a particular mental state is required.",
  "Where are courts supposed to look to find out what is the border between the heartland of defalcation and the badlands of defalcation and whatever else?",
  "The statute --",
  "The statute says that Arizona must accept and use the Federal form. What does that mean? Let me give you two possible definitions: One, the person must be registered if the Federal form is properly completed and submitted; two, the State may not make any further inquiry of the person who submits the form. Maybe you have other definitions, but what is the -- what do you interpret \"accept and use\" to mean?",
  "Well, let me give you this example --",
  "A person rides up to a place to register on a bicycle and gets out and hands in the Federal form. This -- this boy looks like he is 13 years old and he is carrying school books, he is wearing a middle school t-shirt, but he has filled out the form properly. Are they required to register him or can they ask him, could you show me some proof of age, like he would have to if he tried to buy alcohol or cigarettes?",
  "What do you make of the fact that --",
  "I didn't mean to interrupt your sentence. What -- what do you make of the fact that States can create their own forms? Arizona has its own form, right? And I don't believe you argue that its form is illegal. Maybe you think it is and you'll explain that. But what -- how -- and Arizona could put on its own form a demand for the information that it -- it wants to apply to people who submit the Federal form. It seems like a very strange system. So, if somebody happens to fill out the Arizona form, their application may be rejected; whereas if they had filled out the Federal form, it would be accepted. How can that be?",
  "What statutory provision would you challenge that under? There's -- there's a provision under the statute, the numbers are complicated and I don't have it on the tip of my tongue, it says what the State form must do and I didn't see anything in that that would -- that would preclude their requiring this additional proof.",
  "Well, I've read all those provisions and -- all right. Let's assume for the sake of argument that Arizona could do this on its own form. You haven't argued that their form is illegal.",
  "This seems to me like a crazy system. This is like the -- you know, the IRS creating two different tax returns with different -- with different tax rates and different tax tables and how much you pay would depend on which particular form you happened to pick up and submit.",
  "May I ask you a question that I asked Ms. Millett? Does the United States think that the Arizona form is illegal? And if it is not, what sense does it make to have a system in which whether or not someone will successfully register depends on the happenstance of the particular form that the person fills out.",
  "Suppose that New Hampshire had a real strict liability regime, so that you -- you sell a drug, and whether it's unreasonably dangerous or not it causes an injury, you pay, to spread the costs. Would there be a problem with that?",
  "Mr. Frederick argues that that -- that's the thrust of the -- of the New Hampshire law. Why is he wrong on that?",
  "Can I just ask this one more follow-up?",
  "Why -- why would -- why is a generic manufacturer in a worse position under the absolute liability scheme than it would be under the New Hampshire scheme?",
  "Because under the absolute scheme they might say, if that's the cost, we are not going to sell this drug at all? Is that the reason?",
  "If that's correct, and maybe it is, doesn't that mean the drug should never have been approved?",
  "But isn't it true that when the -- the FDA reviewed this whole class of drugs, they decided to pull Bextra, but not this drug?",
  "The -- the SG says that the FDA did have this right, did have it and did consider it, and that's incorrect?",
  "This argument about stopping the sale of the drug completely seems to me to eliminate the impossibility -- impossibility preemption, doesn't it?",
  "But that's true -- isn't that true often in -- in these impossibility cases? Let me say Congress passes a law that says everywhere in the United States you must drive on the right side of the road, and New Hampshire is quirky, they say, in New Hampshire you have to drive on the left side of the road. That would seem to me to be a very clear impossibility case, wouldn't it?",
  "But you could comply with both rules by not driving.",
  "Not to drive at all?",
  "You decide -- if you decide to drive --",
  "Well, as to the consequences, let me give you these two cases. The first is the case in which the petition is timely filed and -- as you see it, but the claimant does not prevail because the claimant is unable to prove that the injury was caused by the vaccine, but there was a reasonable basis for the argument and the argument was made in good faith, so there would be eligibility for attorneys' fees. The second is a case in which there is a question about when the statute of limitations begins to run. And one of the points at which it can begin to run is when there is the onset of significant aggravation of an injury, which seems like a question about which there could be a factual dispute. And in that situation as well, the claimant does not prevail on the statute of limitations argument, but there was a reasonable basis for thinking that the petition was submitted within the period after the -- the onset of this significant aggravation. Why would Congress want to draw a line between -- a distinction between those two situations for the purpose of attorneys' fees?",
  "And if there is a hearing, would the claimant's attorney get -- potentially get attorneys' fees for the representation at the hearing about attorneys' fees?",
  "This may be a question that the government is in a better position to answer, but do -- do you have any sense of how often claims are rejected on the ground of timeliness, what we're dealing with? I mean, you mentioned in a footnote that the fund out of which the -- the claims and the attorneys' fees are paid has a positive balance of $3.5 billion. Maybe the only government fund that has a positive balance, but --",
  "Is this going to bankrupt the -- the system?",
  "Do you know how many cases we might be dealing with?",
  "Who pays for the Special Masters? Is that paid out of the fund?",
  "In response to --",
  "Well, but in answer to Justice Ginsburg's question that -- you said the producers could go to the -- the Court of Federal Claims to contest the taking of -- producers could go to contest the taking of raisins.",
  "If they had not been paid for it.",
  "But are you -- does that mean you do not think that the AMAA withdraws Tucker Act jurisdiction?",
  "Only for handlers.",
  "As this case stands when -- as it comes before us, is there a claim that they -- that money -- the government is trying to take money from them without just compensation?",
  "Is that an issue -- is that an issue we should decide or is that an issue that the Ninth Circuit should decide, whether there is a takings claim for money?",
  "All right. If we assume for the sake of argument that there is such a claim, why does that not fall within Apfel?",
  "Don't they claim that --",
  "Before you leave that, don't they claim that the entire amount that is assessed against them is a taking? Now, maybe they are wrong. That the entire amount assessed against them is a taking without just compensation? Maybe they are wrong, but isn't that a merits question?",
  "Did I understand you to say a couple minutes ago that if the case were remanded, you would be entitled to win on the reasoning of the panel opinion?",
  "What difference does that make? Suppose there was a towing company that lawfully towed cars, but its practice was to hold the car for 24 hours and if it wasn't picked up they would immediately sell it for parts. Your argument would be that's preempted by the Federal statute?",
  "The State can't regulate that?",
  "Right. A private plaintiff could not assert a common law negligence claim if that were done?",
  "Lawfully towed, sold for parts within 24 hours because it wasn't picked up.",
  "Well, if that's -- if that is not related to payment for services, then why is this -- why is there such a relationship here?",
  "It would involve a payment dispute to the same extent as this. Towed, notice sent out immediately, wasn't picked up within 24 hours, sell it for parts.",
  "Out of curiosity, Mr. Waxman, in a case like this, how is the arbitrator paid? Is the arbitrator paid by the hour or a flat fee?",
  "Can I ask you a question on something a little bit different? Did the arbitrator have -- how many parties were there to this agreement? There is Oxford on one side and how many doctors on the other side?",
  "All right, so 20,000. And the effect of the arbitrator's decision is that all of those 20,000 doctors are deemed to have agreed to class arbitration, right?",
  "And if we assume -- if I ask you to assume, for the sake of argument, that this agreement does not constitute an agreement to engage in class arbitration, where did the arbitrator get the authority to make that holding with respect to all of these absent class members?",
  "If they didn't agree to class arbitration, how can they -- and they didn't agree to have the arbitrator decide whether the agreement calls for -- for class arbitration. How did he purport to bind them to that decision?",
  "Wait a minute. Where did he get the authority to make that decision to interpret the contract with respect to them?",
  "You're saying he can do it with respect to Oxford because Oxford agreed to have the arbitrator decide whether this calls for class arbitration. But these other people didn't. They didn't agree to have the arbitrator decide whether it calls for class arbitration.",
  "Well, presumably they could opt out, but did they agree to be bound by this unless they opted out? That's not the usual way people are bound by litigations.",
  "No, but I think you're -- you're not -- you're not accepting my assumption that this is an incorrect interpretation of the contract. That's the assumption. This is incorrect. If we were reviewing this as an appellate court reviewing the interpretation of the contract under Stolt-Nielsen, we would say, this is wrong. This is really wrong. Okay? Assume that to be the case. Then how are they -- how are these absent people bound? And it's really not an answer to say, well, they can opt out. If they didn't agree to be bound by this arbitrator's decision, then they didn't agree to be bound absent by opting out, which is an unusual procedure for being bound by an agreement.",
  "Well, Mr. Olson, is it your position that the only people who could defend a ballot -- a law that's adopted in California through the ballot initiative are the Attorney General and the governor, so that if the Attorney General and the governor don't like the ballot initiative, it will go undefended? Is that your position?",
  "The States are not bound by the same separation of powers doctrine that underlies the Federal Constitution. You couldn't have a Federal initiative, for example. They're free of all that. So start from the proposition that a State has standing to defend the constitutionality of a State law -- beyond dispute. The question then is, who represents the State? Now, in a State that has initiative, the whole process would be defeated if the only people who could defend the statute are the elected public officials. The whole point -- you know this better than I do because you're from California -- the whole point of the initiative process was to allow the people to circumvent public officials about whom they were suspicious. So if you reject that proposition, what is left is the proposition that the State -- State law can choose some other person, some other group to defend the constitutionality of a State law. And the California Supreme Court has told us that the Plaintiffs in this case are precisely those people. So how do you get around that?",
  "Oh seriously, Mr. Olson, if California provides all the substantive benefits of marriage to same-sex domestic partnerships, are you seriously arguing that if California -- if the State -- if the case before us now were from a State that doesn't provide any of those benefits to same-sex couples, this case would come out differently?",
  "I don't think you can have it both ways. Either this case is the same, this would be the same if this were Utah or Oklahoma or it's different because it's California and California has provided all these --",
  "Well, tomorrow you're going to be making a standing argument that some parties think is rather tenuous, but today, you're -- you're very strong for Article III standing?",
  "None of the --",
  "You want us to assess the effects of same-sex marriage, the potential effects on -- of same-sex marriage, the potential -- the effects of Proposition 8. But what is your response to the argument, which has already been mentioned about the need to be cautious in light of the newness of the -- the concept of -- of same-sex marriage? The one thing that the parties in this case seem to agree on is that marriage is very important. It's thought to be a fundamental building block of society and its preservation essential for the preservation of society. Traditional marriage has been around for thousands of years. Same-sex marriage is very new. I think it was first adopted in The Netherlands in 2000. So there isn't a lot of data about its effect. And it may turn out to be a -- a good thing. It may turn out not to be a good thing, as the supporters of Proposition 8 apparently believe. But you want us to step in and render a decision based on an assessment of the effects of this institution, which is newer than cell phones or the Internet? I mean we -- we are not -- we do not have the ability to see the future. On a question like that, of such fundamental importance, why should it not be left for the people, either acting through initiatives and referendums or through their elected public officials?",
  "Well, just in response to that, of course the Constitution could be amended, and -- and I think I read that the California Constitution has been amended 500 times.",
  "So it's not exactly like the U.S. Constitution.",
  "Well, the Solicitor General's standing argument is very abstract. But here is one possible way of understanding it, perhaps the Solicitor General will disavow it, but it would go like this. The President's position in this case is that he is going to continue to enforce DOMA, engage in conduct that he believes is unconstitutional, until this Court tells him to stop. The judgment of the Second Circuit told the Executive Branch to comply with the Equal Protection Clause immediately. The President disagrees with the temporal aspect of that, so the Executive is aggrieved in the sense that the Executive is ordered to do something prior to the point when the Executive believes it should do that thing. Now, wouldn't that be sufficient to make -- to create injury in the Executive and render the Executive an aggrieved party?",
  "Well, how are you aggrieved? \"Aggrieved\" means that you are deprived of your legal rights. And you don't think that you've been deprived of your legal rights because your rights -- your obligations under the Constitution supercede DOMA, and you haven't been deprived of anything that you're entitled to under the Constitution. So how are you aggrieved?",
  "Could I just -- before you go on to the House group, could I just clear up something? In your brief, you argue that you are representing all three branches of the government, is that right?",
  "You're -- you're representing the Judiciary as you stand before us here today --",
  "-- trying to persuade the Court, you're representing the Court?",
  "It seems very strange. So in -- in a criminal case where it's the United States v. Smith, appearing before an Article III judge, the United States, the prosecutor is representing the court as well?",
  "Then why is --",
  "Then why is it sufficient for one house to take the position that the statute is constitutional? The enactment of legislation requires both houses, and usually the signature of the President.",
  "Well, if the law is passed by a bare majority of one of the houses, then each member of that -- of that house who was part of the majority has the same interest in defending its constitutionality.",
  "Well, could I ask you this question, on the question of the House resolution --",
  "-- if -- if a house -- if one of the houses passes a resolution saying that a particular group was always authorized to represent us, do you think it's consistent with the separation of powers for us to examine whether that's a correct interpretation of the rules of that House of Congress?",
  "Suppose we look just at the estate tax provision that's at issue in this case, which provides specially favorable treatment to a married couple as opposed to any other individual or economic unit. What was the purpose of that? Was the purpose of that really to foster traditional marriage, or was Congress just looking for a convenient category to capture households that function as a unified economic unit?",
  "Well, Congress could have achieved exactly what it achieved under Section 3 by excising the term \"married\" from the United States Code and replacing it with something more neutral. It could have said \"certified domestic units,\" and then defined this in exactly the way that Section 3 -- exactly the way DOMA defines \"marriage.\" Would that make a difference? In that instance, the Federal government wouldn't be purporting to say who is married and who is not married, it would be saying who is entitled to various Federal benefits and burdens based on a Federal definition?",
  "Can I take you back to the example that you began with where a member of the military is injured. So let's say three soldiers are injured and they are all in same-sex relationships, and in each instance the other partner in this relationship wants to visit the soldier in -- in a hospital. The first is a spouse in a State that allows same-sex marriage, the second is a domestic partner in a State that an allows that, but not same-sex marriage, the third is in an equally committed loving relationship in a State that doesn't involve either. Now, your argument is that, under Federal law, the first would be admitted -- should be admitted, but the other two would be kept out?",
  "But if I could just take you back to the example. Your -- your position seems to me, yes, one gets in, two stay out, even though your legal arguments would lead to the conclusion that they all should be treated the same.",
  "Well, let me get to the question I asked Mr. Clement. It just gets rid of the word \"marriage,\" takes it out of the U.S. Code completely. Substitutes something else, and defines it as same-sex -- to include same-sex couples. Surely it could do that.",
  "So it's just the word \"marriage\"? And it's just the fact that they use this term \"marriage\"?",
  "But if the estate tax follows State law, would not that create an equal protection problem similar to the one that exists here? Suppose there were a dispute about the -- the State of residence of your client and her partner spouse. Was it New York, was it some other State where same-sex marriage would not have been recognized? And suppose there was -- the State court said the State of residence is a State where it's not recognized. Would -- would you not have essentially the same equal protection argument there that you have now?",
  "Just -- if I could follow up with one -- one question. What if the -- the hypothetical surviving spouse, partner in North Carolina, brought an equal protection argument, saying that there is no -- it is unconstitutional to treat me differently because I am a resident of North Carolina rather than a resident of New York. What would be -- would that be discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation? What would be the level of scrutiny? Would it survive?",
  "Suppose there's a case where the -- the defendant would not have pled guilty without this court saying something inappropriate about it's a case where the defendant would be crazy to go to trial because the trial would lead to a much more severe sentence. Would there be prejudice there?",
  "What -- what if the judge sees what the judge thinks is ineffective assistance of counsel, under our decision in Lafler, taking place? Is there anything that can be done?",
  "But you are arguing for a narrower interpretation of Rule 11(c)(1) than a number of courts of appeals have adopted, isn't that correct?",
  "Could you say something about Mr. Feigin's comments regarding what a judge can and cannot do if the judge thinks that he or she sees a violation of Lafler and Frye taking place?",
  "What if the judge knows as a result of pretrial motions that the evidence in the case is very, very strong. Let's say there's a -- there's been a motion to suppress extremely incriminating evidence and the motion has been denied, so the judge knows this is going to come in. And the judge thinks if this comes in, there's virtually very little chance that the defendant is going to be acquitted, and yet the defendant -- and the judge knows that a plea bargain -- a plea offer was made and the defendant initially was going to take it, and then before it was accepted, it's rejected. Is there anything a judge can do in that situation? Just sit back and, you know, wait for the case to be -- to be reversed?",
  "It just puts -- puts the judge in a very difficult position. It could -- can the judge say, you -- do you realize that I denied your motion to suppress that wiretap? And do you recognize that on that wiretap, you conceded that the loss in this case is $20 million, and do you know that under the sentencing guidelines, the sentence where the loss is $20 million is whatever it is, ten years in jail. If the judge says all of that, has the judge violated Rule 11(c)(1)?",
  "Can I take you back to -- to Justice Ginsburg's question because I'm -- I don't - - I'm not sure you got at what troubles me about that. Suppose there is a substance, a -- a chemical, a molecule in the -- the leaf -- the leaves of a plant that grows in the Amazon, and it's discovered that this has tremendous medicinal purposes. Let's say it -- it treats breast cancer. A new discovery, a new way -- a way is found, previously unknown, to extract that. You make a drug out of that. Your answer is that cannot be patent -- patented, it's not eligible for patenting because the chemical composition of the -- of the drug is the same as the chemical that exists in the leaves of the plant.",
  "But you're making -- you keep making the hypotheticals easier than they're intended to be. It's not just the case of taking the leaf off the tree and chewing it. Let's say if you do that, you'd have to eat a whole forest to get the -- the value of this. But it's extracted and -- and reduced to a concentrated form. That's not patent -- that's not eligible?",
  "Well, when you concede that, then I'm not sure how you distinguish the isolated DNA here because it has a different function. Will you dispute that? Isolated DNA has a very different function from the DNA as it exists in nature. And although the chemical composition may not be different, it -- it certainly is in a different form. So what is the distinction?",
  "Well, the issue here is a very difficult one. It's one on which the government has changed its position, isn't that correct?",
  "It seems that there is disagreement within the Executive Branch about it. This case has been structured in an effort to get us to decide this on the broadest possible ground, that there's no argument, that it's just about 101, it's not about any other provision of the Patent Act. Why -- why should we -- why should we do that? We have claims that if patent eligibility is denied here it will prevent investments that are necessary for the development of new drugs or it will lead those who develop the new drugs to -- new diagnostic techniques, to keep those secret, not disclose them to the public. Why -- why should we jump in and -- and decide the broadest possible question?",
  "Why is the chemical composition in the isolated DNA different? You were about to explain that.",
  "But isn't this just a question of probability? To get back to your baseball bat example, which at least I -- I can understand better than perhaps some of this biochemistry, I suppose that in, you know, I don't know how many millions of years trees have been around, but in all of that time possibly someplace a branch has fallen off a tree and it's fallen into the ocean and it's been manipulated by the waves, and then something's been washed up on the shore, and what do you know, it's a baseball bat. Is that --",
  "-- is that what Dr. Lander is talking about?",
  "But what if a tribe makes eligibility available for anybody who, as a result of a DNA test, can establish any Indian ancestry, no matter how slight?",
  "No, it's different from his. He says it's -- it has to be based on blood. This would be based on blood.",
  "Well, if this case would have come out the same way under purely South Carolina law, then why are we here?",
  "Well, family law is traditionally a State province, but your argument is that Federal law can take a traditional family law term like \"parent\" and perhaps others and give it a meaning that is very different from its traditional meaning or its meaning under State law?",
  "Strike the \"traditional\" meaning, but its meaning under State law.",
  "Would you draw a distinction between Mr. Salinas's situation and someone who's questioned in the home -- in the person's home or on the street?",
  "And what if -- what if the person -- what if the person was totally unknown to the police, but called up the police and said they want -- wants to talk to them for some purpose. You wouldn't draw a distinction between that situation?",
  "He wants to talk to them and --",
  "He wants to talk to them, and then, in the course of this conversation, the same thing happens that happened here.",
  "Unless you're going to argue that -- that silence cannot be -- can never be commented on in any noncustodial situation -- and I didn't think you were willing to go that far when I was questioning you previously -- you're going to have the same kind of line-drawing questions, aren't you?",
  "Where was it held? What was the nature? Who initiated it? Was the person really under suspicion? What was the purpose of the -- of the questioning?",
  "Well, we start out with the power under the Constitution to make rules to regulate the military and we end up with a registration requirement that applies to someone who's not in the military and perhaps is not even living anywhere near any military installation. So what would be helpful for me is to start out with the constitutional provision, identify a purpose of that that is served by this civil registration that is imposed later, and trace this whole progress through the Necessary and Proper Clause.",
  "Yes.",
  "We are not talking -- I'm sorry.",
  "I didn't mean to interrupt your question.",
  "We're not talking about statutory authorization. We are talking about constitutional power. So if we start out with the example of registration for life being imposed as part of supervised release, part of the criminal sentence, then we go to an example where it is not part of the criminal sentence, but it is a civil requirement triggered by a separate civil proceeding for every Federal -- every person convicted of a sex offense under Federal law. Now, if that were the setup statutorily, would that fall within Congress's power under Article 1?",
  "Well, we know what -- and we know what power they are relying on. Let's just look at the power that they're relying on here. It's the power to make rules for the regulation of the military. So part of their -- in the exercise of their power to make rules for the regulation of the military, they impose a civil sex offender registration requirement for someone convicted of a sex offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. That does not, in your judgment, fall within Article I?",
  "Well, let me -- let me try this chain of reasoning out on you and -- and get your reaction. We're starting out with the power of Congress to make rules for the regulation of the military. And one of the things that they want to do in making those rules is to make military installations acceptable to the local communities where they are located. They know from experience, for example, what's happened in Okinawa, that when have you military personnel who go -- who commit sex offenses with people off base, it can cause tremendous opposition. And this is what happened here, not the opposition, but an offense involving a 15-year-old girl who lived off the base. So in order to ensure that there -- we don't have excessive civilian opposition to the location of military bases, we are going to do a number of things. One thing is we're going to criminally prosecute members of the military who commit these offenses. This will deter. This will incapacitate. But also, to provide further assurance to the community that these people are not going to be dangerous, we are going to require them to register. Now, maybe that's too attenuated, but I'd like to get your reaction. Why could Congress not do that under the Necessary and Proper Clause?",
  "Is it your argument that Congress lacks the power to impose supervised release after the date when the person leaves the military?",
  "Someone is sentenced to prison --",
  "-- under the UCMJ, released, dishonorably discharged from the military. Can Congress say the person has to remain on supervised release for a longer period of time after he is returned to civilian status?",
  "See, I understand -- I can understand why that might create -- that might raise all sorts of constitutional arguments about notice and so forth. But I don't see how that -- how that connects with the question whether Congress has the power to do it under -- under Article I --",
  "-- under the power to regulate the military.",
  "Well, you could be making the argument that the power to make rules for the military applies only to people who are in the military, and that once you're out of the military that power does not permit Congress to do anything special to you. But you're not making that argument, I gather.",
  "If an insured, after making a designation of a beneficiary, writes a will and leaves the insurance proceeds to a different person, the Federal law would still, as interpreted by the State Supreme Court, require the money to be paid to the designated beneficiary, wouldn't it?",
  "And what does that say about Congress's supposed desire to ensure that the money goes to the person that the insured wants it to go to?",
  "Well, the point is if Congress's objective, if one of its objectives in addition to administrative convenience was to effectuate the will of the insured, then I don't see why it would provide for Federal law to override a subsequent will which directly expresses the desire of the insured.",
  "Well, my problem with this case is, other than administrative convenience, I don't see what purpose Congress could have thought that this provision serves.",
  "What else -- what other -- what other objective do you think Congress was trying to achieve?",
  "Why would it override the expressed will of an insured in -- the express desire of an insured in, for example, a will that's executed after the time of the assignment --",
  "-- and the designation of the beneficiary.",
  "But why? You've got a -- you've got a designation of a beneficiary in 1975, let's say, and then you have a will that's executed in 2005. Why would Congress want the -- the designation of the beneficiary so far in the past to override the expression of the desire of the insured in the subsequent will?",
  "How can that be the best designation of intent? You have a designation long in the past, then you have a will that says that, the insurance proceeds I'm leaving to a different person. How is the earlier designation of a beneficiary a better expression of intent?",
  "Well, that provides a simple -- that provides a -- a simple rule for the people who are affected by this dispute, and those are the people who are -- who stand to benefit either under the designation of the beneficiary or under the will. But what -- why does Congress care about that? There are a lot of messy domestic relations issues out there in the States. That's what Congress was doing? They said, you know, these -- that State domestic relations law leads to a lot of nasty and difficult disputes -- you know, Bleak House. Let's intervene and let's simplify this with a simple rule. Do you think that's what was involved here?",
  "Well, why would Congress want to make sure that the money goes to the designated beneficiary where there is a very clear expression of intent on the part of the insured that the money go someplace else?",
  "These arguments seem to be circular. You're saying that the -- the reason for making sure that the designated beneficiary gets the money instead of the person whom the insured has subsequently and very clearly said he or she wants to get the money is to make sure that the designated beneficiary gets the money, and gets it without any hassle.",
  "When are they told -- when are they told over and over again?",
  "They -- they get the form when they -- when they sign up for the life insurance, so they periodically get notices from OPM saying, now, remember, you've designated so-and-so as your beneficiary, you know, annually, like in the open season? Do you really want to keep this person as your beneficiary?",
  "Nobody has told me that for many years.",
  "Do you think that situation comes up a lot, where an -- an insured wants to make sure that a former spouse gets more money than the spouse is entitled to under the divorce decree?",
  "Well, everything is possible. Do you think that's a common situation? That's what Congress was --",
  "-- was concerned about?",
  "I'm not aware of any case in which this Court has held that it is permissible for Congress to condition Federal funding on the recipient's expression of agreement with ideas with which the recipient disagrees. I'm not aware of any case in which that kind of compelled speech has been permitted. And I would be interested in -- and it seems to me like quite a -- a dangerous proposition. I would be interested in whatever limitations you think there might be on that rule, which seems to be the general rule that you're advocating. Other than the requirement of germaneness, is there anything else?",
  "Well, let me give you this example, which is mentioned in one of the amicus briefs. The government provides lots of funding to universities to -- in various forms, either directly or through student loans, in the form of tax exemptions, so anything that would be germane to the general purpose of higher education, presumably, could be attached as a condition to those funds. Would that be correct?",
  "With what -- with what limitations?",
  "The government could have a whole list of things -- of principles that it thinks should be incorporated into higher education, and it could require a university, as a condition of receiving these -- this money, let's say directed through student loans, to express agreement with all of these propositions. Would that be true?",
  "Well, let me give you another example that's along the same lines. The Federal government provides lots of funds to entities and individuals who are involved in the provision of health care. So let's suppose Congress says that, we think that the issue of guns is very germane to public health, and therefore, we will not allow anybody to receive any of these funds directly or indirectly, unless that entity or person proclaims agreement with whatever we happen to think at the moment about guns. So they must either say we believe that guns should be strictly limited -- access to them should be strictly limited for public health purposes or that guns should be freely available because we think that promotes public health. That would be permissible, wouldn't it?",
  "Well, why would it not?",
  "I don't -- I don't want to interrupt your rebuttal, but I don't see the difference between those two -- those two things that you just tried to distinguish.",
  "Well, suppose you have an organization that previously has expressed support for the legalization of -- of prostitution, but, then, when you tell them, well, if that's your policy, you can't get our money, they say, well, we need your money, so we're going to have to say uncle and, now, we are opposed to the legalization of prostitution. That then -- that isn't trying to change people's viewpoint?",
  "To change the viewpoint that they are expressing?",
  "When you say Texas has the right to go into Oklahoma, just -- just think about that phrase. That's -- that's very striking. I mean, it sounds like they are going to send in the National Guard or the Texas Rangers.",
  "But you were saying that Oklahoma -- that Texas has the right to force Oklahoma to take private property in Oklahoma by eminent domain if necessary.",
  "Well, I don't understand your answer. If -- if you're correct, wouldn't the Oklahoma board have to give priority to the Texas applicants in order to make sure that Texas got its share of the water? It couldn't just treat -- it couldn't just be indifferent as to whether it was an Oklahoma or Texas applicant.",
  "Is it correct that -- that there are reservoirs in Texas that flow into -- from which water is released into the Red River?",
  "Okay. And --",
  "And what if Texas didn't -- what if Texas could get -- could -- could release that water and increase the flow of the river, but it chose not to do so, so it could take other water out of the river?",
  "Yeah.",
  "What is your definition of -- of property? In your reply brief, you begin by saying that you're -- you are not arguing that the property has to be tangible and includes some forms of intangible property. How would you draw the line?",
  "Did this court ever hold that the Price Waterhouse framework applied to retaliation claims?",
  "As of 1991 -- well, Gomez-Perez and Jackson came after 1991, right?",
  "So, as of 1991, was there any case -- any decision of this Court other than Sullivan, that could have possibly led Congress to a conclusion that the general prohibition against discrimination included a prohibition of retaliation?",
  "I take -- I take you back to your opening statement, that there is no reason why Congress might have wanted to have a different standard for substantive discrimination and retaliation. Would you disagree with the proposition that the motivating factor analysis creates special problems in the retaliation -- in the retaliation context?",
  "Well, I know it's not going to go away. Let me give you this example -- this hypothetical. An employee thinks that he is about to be fired. And let's -- let's suppose that the employer really has a good, nondiscriminatory reason for firing the employee. On the eve of that, the employee makes a spurious charge of discrimination and does it in a way to maximize the embarrassment to the employer. Then the employer formally makes the decision to terminate the employee. And what the employer says at that time is, we were going to fire so-and-so anyway for all these other reasons, but, now, because he has done this and really embarrassed us publicly, we are really happy that we are going to fire him. Now, how does that work out under the motivating factor analysis?",
  "Is that correct? Can't you -- can't you succeed on a retaliation claim if your underlying substantive claim is invalid?",
  "Well, no, I understand that, and it's not a policy question. It's a question of interpreting the statute. But I understood your lead argument in favor of a particular interpretation of the statute to be it can't mean what the Petitioner wants it to mean, what the Petitioner says it means because that would make no sense. And the point of my question was to explore the possibility that there might be a very good reason why Congress would want a different causation standard for substantive discrimination and -- and retaliation.",
  "Well, Price Waterhouse is a little different from subsection (m) though, isn't it? You have to have proof of -- you have to have direct evidence of a substantial -- direct and substantial evidence before you get into Price Waterhouse, right? You don't need that under subsection (m).",
  "Isn't that the -- isn't it the case that Justice O'Connor's opinion in Price Waterhouse required direct evidence and substantial evidence before there was a shift in the burden of proof.",
  "That's -- that's a fair point, but it's, like, if we change it a little bit so that it's -- it's not frivolous, but it is clearly groundless, once its examined, then you still have the problem.",
  "The problem is --",
  "The problem is this: It's one thing to say -- and it's a good thing to say to employers, when you are making employment decisions, you take race out of your mind, take gender out of your mind, take national origin out of your mind. It's not something you can even think about. But, when you are talking about retaliation, when you are talking about an employer who has been, perhaps publicly, charged with discrimination and the employer knows that the charge is not a good charge, it's pretty -- it's very, very difficult to say to that employer and very difficult for the employer to say, I'm going to take this completely out of my mind, I'm not even going to think about the fact that I am -- have been wrongfully charged with discrimination. Isn't that a real difference?",
  "Well, we don't --",
  "Well, we don't really have to reach this issue in this case, according to your submission, but what would happen if a State -- an intermediate State appellate court said the law is such-and-such and then a -- a person is tried in the interim -- is tried and, subsequently, the State supreme court says that intermediate State court decision was incorrect, that never was the law of this State; the law was exactly the opposite?",
  "Well, what I'm wondering is how we even get beyond the statement, the holding by a State supreme court regarding the -- the law of the State. Don't we have to accept that as the -- as the law of the State? Isn't that what our decision in Fiore says? If the State supreme court says, this is the law, and it's always been the law, then how can we second-guess that?",
  "In Griffin -- you describe Griffin in your brief as follows: \"The court vacated, reversed, and remanded the decision below based on,\" quote, \"defendant's claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to explore defenses of diminished capacity and insanity.\"",
  "\"And insanity.\" So it wasn't specifically -- wasn't limited to diminished capacity.",
  "It was insanity in general.",
  "Well, what is the unfairness --",
  "What is the unfairness here? Do you think there's a reliance?",
  "What is the -- so what is the unfairness here?",
  "I -- I don't see how the question can be whether there was a change in Michigan law because we can't second-guess the Michigan Supreme Court about what Michigan law was. Michigan law is whatever the State supreme court says it was. We might agree, we might disagree. So I think we have to start from the proposition that the law didn't change because that's what the Michigan Supreme Court said. So there must be some other ex post facto principle that applies when there's a certain type of unfairness. And I wonder if you could articulate what that principle is.",
  "Well, I think you're -- what you're arguing is that, under certain -- in evaluating certain constitutional claims, the -- the question of what State law is, is not dispositive. I don't think you're arguing that a Federal court has a right to tell a State court what State law is.",
  "Well, I mean, suppose this were a diversity case. Can -- can a Federal court say -- you know, we -- we think that the -- the decisions of the intermediate State supreme court were correct and this new decision by the State supreme court is incorrect, so we're not going to follow that?",
  "It's not -- it's not this case because, there, you're trying to figure out what State law is. Here you're applying a constitutional principle.",
  "So what is that -- that gets me to the second part of my question.",
  "What is the -- the constitutional principle that doesn't depend on what State law was?",
  "This is -- this is the due process issue, right?",
  "So why is it unfair? Why is there an entitlement under due process to assert what appears under the law of the State's intermediate court decisions to be a valid defense, but is later determined never to have been or not to have been, at that time, a valid defense? What is the unfairness involved there?",
  "Well, in Justice ­­ Justice Kagan's hypothetical and in some of the others, it seems that it's really irrelevant in whether the assets in question are securities or some other asset. And it's also ­­ and, therefore, a fortiori, it's irrelevant whether ­­ if it involves securities, whether they're covered or they're not covered. Now, would you be willing to concede that, in that situation, where it really ­­ all you're talking about is an asset.

  "What's your best case on that?",
  "Can I take you back to the test that you think we should apply here?",
  "The test that Mr. Clement articulated and that you agreed with seems to amount to ­­ to saying, when exactly what is alleged here is alleged, that that's ­­ that that's within 10b or 10b­5, that's not that helpful as a precedent going forward.

How do we ­­ how would we determine that?",
  "I don't understand what the first textual flaw is.",
  "What is the jumping off point for this flaw?",
  "Right.",
  "Well, everybody ­­ the case proceeds on the assumption that the ­­ that the CDs were not covered securities. The question is whether it's ­­ the \"in connection with\" requirement is met by the allegation, which is interpreted to mean that there would be future purchases and sales of covered securities.

  "It doesn't say a misrepresentation about the covered security. It says, \"a misrepresentation in connection with.\"",

  "Can I just be clear on your ­­ your position on the issue of whether there has to be an actual purchase or sale?",
  "What is your answer? Yes, there must be, or, no, it's not essential?",
  "You don't want us to decide the case on that basis?",

But now that the new statute has been passed, why should we consider whether someone who was a non­employee lacked a ­­ a 1983 cause of action during the period when that ­­ prior to the enactment of that statute?",
  "In your brief, could I just ­­ you say ­­ I think this is pretty close to the exact words ­­ there's no realistic possibility of your obtaining a holding that Mr. Levin is an employee within the ADEA. But do you concede that now?",
  "No. Do you concede that he is not an employee? If you just say that there's no realistic possibility that the courts are going to take this correct position, then the issue is still in the case. So is it your position that he is an employee or he is not an employee?",
  "Well, if you're not willing to say that he is not an employee, then the issue is still in the case, and we would have ­­ if we were to rule on the ADEA issue, wouldn't we have to decide whether there is a remedy for somebody who is an employee within the ADEA?",
  "The district court might be wrong on that. The Seventh Circuit might be wrong on that. And you may be right. There's not much of a realistic possibility that you're going to get a reversal of that. But the issue is still in the case, unless you want to give it up.",
  "So what ­­",
  "You want us to hold that the Seventh Circuit lacked jurisdiction to consider whether ­­ whether there is a cause of action under Section 1983. So that precedent, that Seventh Circuit precedent, would be wiped from the books. The issue would be back in the case. If ultimately there was another appeal, maybe it would go to a different Seventh Circuit panel. Maybe it would come out differently. So you want that wiped away. And you want us to hold only ­­ to limit our consideration to the ADEA and not consider GERA, so that would be back in the case when it came ­­ when it went back to the district court. So that's correct? That's what you want?",
  "Well, can I ask you a question about the constitutional right? Do you ­­ do you agree that the standard for an equal protection age­discrimination claim is traditional, full­blown, rational­basis review?",
  "So that if there's any conceivable ground on which the decision­maker could have decided that age was ­­ it was proper to make an age classification, there is no constitutional violation?",
  "No, I'm just talking about equal protection age discrimination.",
  "And what if the Illinois legislature passed a statute that said, now, forget about the ADEA, there is no ADEA, there is no state anti­discrimination law involved here, all we are talking about is equal protection. And they passed a law that said, all attorneys working for the State of Illinois must retire at the age of 60 because everybody knows ­­ you know, once a lawyer passes 60, there's nothing left.",
  "Would that be ­­ would that survive a rational basis review?",
  "Well, that's true, but is that the issue? Is that really the qualified immunity issue, whether irrational age discrimination violates equal protection? Or is the qualified immunity issue whether, on the facts here, an official could believe that there was no constitutional violation ­­ reasonably believe there was no constitutional violation? Isn't the latter ­­",
  "Isn't the latter the real question?",
  "Well, that's not what the district court held though, is it?",
  "Well, I thought the district court simply held that an official should have realized that irrational age discrimination was a violation of the Constitution, not that an official should have realized that it was a violation of the Constitution to do what was alleged to have been done here.",
  "You don't see the difference between the two?",
  "If there's a qualified immunity appeal on the question ­­ on the issue of whether, let's say, a search was an unreasonable search, would qualified immunity be denied on the ground that an official should realize that an unreasonable search is unconstitutional? Would that be ­­ that ­­ would that be the issue under qualified immunity?",
  "Ah, on the facts that were presented?",
  "Was ­­ was the sentence that was ultimately imposed after the trial for the second­degree murder conviction within the guidelines ­­ within the Michigan guidelines?",
  "What ­­ do you know what those guidelines were?",
  "Could you ­­ could you explain the procedural situation before the Michigan Court of Appeals? There was a motion by the Respondent for a remand to the trial court to create a record; is that ­­ that correct ­­",
  "­­ on the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel? And so the ­­ the question that the court of appeals had to decide was whether the materials that were submitted by the Respondent were sufficient to justify the hearing.",
  "And the court of appeals, I gather, said they're not sufficient and cited, among other things or principally, the fact that the Respondent had claimed innocence, and that was the reason for the ­­ the change of attorney. So the issue really wasn't ­­ that was before them was really not entitlement to relief, but in the course of deciding whether there should be a remand, they necessarily got to the issue of whether there was an entitlement to relief. Is that ­­ is that correct? Or do I not understand?",
  "What do you make of the fact that ­­ what do you make of the fact that, at the change of plea hearing, the first attorney didn't mention the claim of innocence, only mentioned the fact that the sentence was above the guidelines?",
  "On the question of this ­­ of this sentence, what do you think were the ­­ the range of reasonable sentences that could have been imposed in compliance with our recent decisions? You have ­­ you have the sentence that was offered before the trial, but that was predicated on, A, testimony and, B, not having to go to trial. And then you have the sentence that was imposed after the trial, when there was no testimony and there was a trial. So what was the ­­ what do you think a trial court could reasonably do in that situation, just split the difference?",
  "Are you arguing that he ­­ he needed to be ­­ he needed to have enough material and to have familiarized himself enough with everything that's relevant to the case to be able to go to trial before he could move to have the ­­ the previous plea withdrawn?",
  "All right. Well, then I don't understand what the argument was.",
  "Isn't it ­­ is it unreasonable to read the Pierson affidavit ­­ and ­­ and you submitted that; isn't that correct?",
  "All right. To read it to mean that there were discussions between Deputy Ott and Titlow, and Titlow said she wasn't guilty? Ott said, well, if you are not guilty, you shouldn't plead guilty. I will refer you to an attorney. If you want me to, I could ask somebody to come and talk to me. That seems to be a direct quote from ­­ from Titlow. Isn't that ­­ so isn't it reasonable to read it that way?",
  "Who was the attorney at that stage? I take it, it wasn't the trial attorney because the ­­ a big part of the claim before the Michigan Court of Appeals was that the trial attorney was also ineffective.",
  "Who was it?",
  "And she's ­­ is she with your office or she's ­­",
  "But she was appointed.",
  "If that's the case ­­",
  "Your arguments seemed to be ­­ have had a head­on collision. If this is nothing but a manslaughter case, then why was ­­ what argument do you have that Toca was ineffective in saying, let's go to trial. So if you're convicted of manslaughter without the plea, you'll get your guidelines sentence on the manslaughter case?",
  "Well, that's not a manslaughter case. I thought you were just saying it's a manslaughter case.",
  "You have my head ­­",
  "You have my head spinning. I thought you were making the argument that there's nothing unfair about requiring acceptance of ­­ about the imposition of a manslaughter sentence because this was a manslaughter case. I thought you were making that argument.",
  "Did I misunderstand that?",
  "Can I ask you about Mr. ­­ Mr. Toca's ethical lapses? Are they ­­ do they have a legal significance in this case?",
  "In what sense is his credibility ­­ did his credibility figure in the decision of the Michigan Court of Appeals?",
  "What was submitted to the Michigan Court of Appeals? Not the ­­ I am not talking about the exhibits that were attached, but there was a motion, a brief? What was it?",
  "It's not in the habeas record, it's not in the record of the Federal Court. And we've been unable to get it from the State court, but it does exist?",
  "This motion?",
  "Well, I may have an overly suspicious mind, but I don't know. If I saw 100 PACs rise up and all of them said exactly the same thing, we're going to make contributions to the five most contested Senate ­­ the candidates in the five most contested Senate races, I would be suspicious. And maybe the FEC would also be suspicious that they didn't just all spring up independently.",
  "In Buckley, the Court sustained ­­ sustained aggregate limits. What has changed since Buckley?",
  "Those were all created by the dairy industry or by the Nixon campaign; is that correct?",
  "But we are talking here about ­­ we're talking here about campaign contributions. Isn't it illegal for a candidate to take campaign contributions and use it to buy a Maserati?",
  "Well, then I don't see how that ­­ that really gets to the point.",
  "Well, what troubles me about your ­­ what troubles me about your argument, General Verrilli, and about the District Court’s opinion is that what I see are wild hypotheticals that are not, obviously, plausible or ­­ and lack ­­ certainly lack any empirical support. Now, you've ­­ you've chosen to use the same hypothetical the District Court used about the $3.5 million contribution that would be ­­ that could be given by a coordinate ­­ which involves all of the House candidates and all of the Senate candidates in a particular year getting together with all of the ­­ all of the parties' national party committees, plus all of the state party committees, and then ­­ and that's how you get up to the $3.5 million figure; isn't that right?",
  "Now, how ­­ how realistic is that? How realistic is it that all of the state party committees, for example, are going to get money and they're all going to transfer it to one candidate? For 49 of them, it's going to be a candidate who is not in their own state. And there are virtually no instances of state party committees contributing to candidates from another state. And the other part of it that seems dubious, on its face, is that all of the party ­­ all of the candidates for the House and the Senate of a particular party are going to get together, and they are going to transfer money to one candidate. There really ­­ you cited in your brief the example – the best examples, I take it, of ­­ of contributions from some candidates to other candidates. They are very small. Isn't that true?",
  "Well, I don't understand that ­­",
  "Unless the money is transferred to ­­ you have to get it from the person who wants to corrupt to the person who is going to be corrupted. And unless the money can make it from A to B, I don't see where the quid pro quo argument is.",
  "I understand ­­",
  "These ­­ these aggregate limits might not all stand or fall together. Let ­­ just take this example, if you can just take a minute and walk me through this step­by­step. You have somebody who wants to corrupt a member of the House, and this person's strategy is to make contributions to multiple House candidates with the hope, the expectation, the plan that those candidates are going to transfer ­­ transfer the money to the ­­ the member that this person wants to corrupt. Now, how is that person going to accomplish that, given the earmarking regulations, and ­­ and the limits on how much one member can contribute to another?",
  "Well, if you're ­­ I mean, if you're not going to defend the application of the aggregate limits in that situation, doesn't it follow that, as applied to that situation, these are ­­ these are unconstitutional?",
  "Well, then just explain to me how it's going to be done. The person gives to member A with the hope that member A is going to give it to member B. If the person even implies, when making the contribution to A, that person wants it to go to B, that's earmarked. So how is this going to be done?",
  "Well, they are making ­­ they are making the argument that there are ­­ that the regulations that already exist about transfers from one entity to another prevent a lot of what you're complaining ­­ what you're ­­ what you are worried about. But if they are not sufficient, they could be bolstered. The aggregate limits are a very blunt way of trying to get out ­­ get at the problem that you are ­­ that you are worried about. That's their argument. What ­­ are ­­ is that wrong? There is nothing more that could be done to prevent transfers from joint fundraising committees or from one member to another or from state parties to candidates?",
  "I just don't understand that. You mean, at the time when the person sends the money to this hypothetical joint fundraising committee, there is a corruption problem immediately, even though ­­ what if they just took the money and they burned it? That would be a corruption problem there?",
  "When does the corruption ­­ yes. When does the corruption occur? It occurs when it's transferred to ­­ to the person who has power and ­­ and they want to corrupt.",
  "Is it correct that your position would allow the IRS to evade the normal statute of limitations?",
  "Or deficiency? No?",
  "In the Stewart case to which you just referred, the court said, \"The parties do not dispute that the district court properly denied the motion to dismiss the case for improper venue under 1406(a)\" because Respondent apparently does business in the Northern District of Alabama, which was not the jurisdiction specified in the forum selection clause. So what ­­ if we were to write an opinion in your favor, what would you suggest we say about that?",
  "Well, that's ­­ that's true, but it means that the entire discussion in Stewart is beside the point. The Court wrote a decision about an issue that really never should arise because the party seeking ­­ as you see it, the party seeking to enforce the forum selection clause should proceed under 1406. So Stewart said, well, if ­­ if you proceed under the wrong provision, this is how it should come out. It makes the whole decision essentially meaningless, doesn't it?",
  "I don't see how that would ­­ I don't see how that would work. You're ­­ this is the argument you made in your reply brief, that if this ­­ if the case had been filed in the jurisdiction specified in the forum selection clause, that court could nevertheless proceed under 1404(a) and transfer it back to the Western District of Texas, for example. That's ­­ that's your argument, right?",
  "In exceptional cases. But 1404(a) says that it can ­­ a case can be transferred to a district where it might have been brought. And your argument under 1406 is that they couldn't be brought in the Western District of Texas, that's a place where there's a wrong venue.",

  "Can I ask you this about the Professor Sachs' argument? Doesn't it lead to the consequence ­­ doesn't it show that ­­ wouldn't it mean that Justice Scalia's dissent was correct in Stewart and the majority was wrong in Stewart? Because if this is ­­ if this is contractual ­­ suppose Ricoh, in that case, had moved ­­ had adopted ­­ had taken the approach that Professor Sachs has recommended and moved for summary judgment – moved to 12(b)(6) or summary judgment; that would be a contract issue. It would be governed by Alabama law. Alabama law says the forum selection clause is no good.",
  "Well, the interests ­­ the interests of justice that the district court weighed almost all boiled down to the interests of your client, the inconvenience of witnesses. Well, Atlantic Marine, to the extent we're talking about their witnesses, they're not concerned about the inconvenience of having their witnesses go to ­­ to Norfolk, but your witnesses ­­ the other witnesses are your witnesses. So that's a factor that goes to your convenience. Compulsory process to produce witnesses, same thing. So what were the public interests that ­­ what were the interests that were weighed here that are not the interests of J­Crew?",
  "Well, if they're not your witnesses, then they're ­­ they're Atlantic Marine's witnesses. So why should that be ­­ why should the inconvenience of Atlantic Marine's witnesses be a factor that weighs against Atlantic Marine's position that the case should be tried in Norfolk?",
  "Who ­­ who is going to call these witnesses, you or Atlantic Marine?",
  "You do, so they're your witnesses. The fact that they don't work for you is ­­ is immaterial here. So let's say they're out of the picture. Now, what else ­­ what's left? What other public interests are involved?",

  "Oh, okay.",
  "Well, if 1404 ­­ if the court ­­",

  "If 1404 is the correct procedural route, why shouldn't the rule be something like this, where there is a forum selection clause, the burden is on ­­ the burden of trying to establish venue in some other jurisdiction is on the party opposing the forum selection clause, not the party that's invoking the forum selection clause. And the only factors that can be considered against the forum selection clause to ­­ to result in an exceptional case where that wouldn't be honored are factors that have nothing to do with the convenience of the ­­ of the party that doesn't want it tried in ­­ in the selected forum or with the likelihood of success of the party that doesn't want it tried in the ­­ in the jurisdiction specified in the forum selection clause. So in your case, if there had been a hurricane that wiped out the courts of the Eastern District of Virginia for some period of time so no cases could be tried, or there was an incredible backload of cases there that would prevent the case from being tried, maybe that would be ­­ those would be something that might amount to an exceptional circumstance, but everything else is off the board.

  "But if we assume, for the sake of argument, that there isn't a preservation issue regarding this in­home ­­ this at­home question, why shouldn't the rule be that, unless a corporation is incorporated in the jurisdiction or has its principal place of business in the jurisdiction, the ­­ the acts of the subsidiary are not attributable, unless it's an alter ego. It's a nice, clean rule. Many of the prominent scholars in this area think that the American doctrine of general jurisdiction doesn't serve any good purpose.

  "So I don't know why that's a hard question that you asked about the student who says, I want to talk about race. What if it's a white student who comes in and says, I want to talk about race. I'm white and therefore you should admit me, you should give me preference. The State can't say, no, we don't want to hear that?",
  "Well, I don't understand your answer then. If the student ­­ one student comes in and says I want to talk about how well I play the cello, all right, we'll listen to that.

Let's say that the ­­ the decision about admissions criteria across the board is basically delegated to the faculty. All right? And the faculty adopts some sort of affirmative action plan. And now that is overruled in favor of a colorblind approach at various levels going up the ladder.

Maybe it's overruled through a constitutional amendment. At what point does the political restructuring doctrine kick in?",
  "Well, that really ­­ that really isn't responsive to my question. Let's say exactly what was done here is done at all of these levels. At what point does the doctrine kick in? When it goes from the faculty to the dean? From the dean to the president, et cetera, et cetera? Where does this apply?",
  "But would that be true ­­ I'm sorry. Would that be true if they had never gotten involved in admissions criteria before? They have the authority, but they left that to the university officials.",

  "Well, ERISA doesn't have a statute of limitations, it doesn't specifically set out a statute of limitations for this type of claim. But it does have a savings clause that says it doesn't preempt State laws that regulate insurance. So what would happen in this situation? Let's say that a State statute says essentially what the plan at issue says. It says that a claim for the incorrect denial of insurance benefits must be brought within three years after the proof of loss. And now let's assume we agree with you, that under ERISA, any statute of limitations for the denial of benefits must begin not when the proof of loss must be filed, but upon the denial of benefits. Does it follow, then, that the rule that you're advocating would mean that ERISA preempted the State law that regulated insurance in the way that I just specified?",
  "I think your answer to that question has to be yes; otherwise, the situation would be a mess.",
  "But I ­­ but in ­­ in what sense is the law that I hypothesize not a law that regulates insurance? So why wouldn't it fall within ERISA's savings clause?",
  "I find it very hard to answer the question that is presented here without knowing the answer to the preemption question that I asked Mr. Wessler. And I know you refer to it in a footnote in your brief and you say that this ­­ the type of State statute to which I referred would likely be preempted. And I can understand why you wouldn't want to go further than that on that question in a case where that question isn't squarely presented. But if it's not presented, then I think we would be creating an incredible mess that Congress would not have intended. So I really don't understand how I can answer the question here without knowing the answer to the question there.",
  "If we agree with you, would a State legislature have the authority to pass a statute setting out a particular ­­ a specific statute of limitations for ERISA claims?",
  "Why would ­­ why would employers with ERISA plans be hurt by the rule that the Petitioner is advocating going forward?

  "Well, you started to answer this question before, but I'm not sure I understand the answer, why this proof of loss model is ­­ is so attractive in the disability insurance field? You said that it provides a clear date on which you know you can begin to count. But so does an accrual rule. So maybe you can explain a little bit more.",
  "Right, right.",
  "Well, if we agree with you, would the Federal courts and maybe ultimately this Court in the end have to specify what the statute of limitations is, the length of time? So we have a bunch of cases from different courts, and one circuit says 2 years is ­­ is the ­­ that's the shortest you can have. Another one says, no, you can have a year. Another one says, well, you could have 9 months. How would this ultimately happen? Wouldn't we be driven to that?",
  "They specify a lot of different lengths, and then they're all challenged ­­ different ones are challenged in different courts, and the courts have to say what's reasonable. And there's no State statute of limitations that applies to this situation. So it all comes down just to a question of reasonableness.",
  "Well, that's ­­ I'm sorry. That's pretrial detention without bail. I thought Justice Scalia's question had to do with detaining someone who was indicted, but couldn't make bail.",
  "But why, in that situation, would the defendant not have the constitutional right to have a determination by a judge as to whether there was probable cause?",
  "At these hearings, when they have been conducted, what do they look like? The rules of evidence would not apply, I assume, so the government could call, let's say, a case agent who would provide a summary of the ­­­ some of the evidence ­­ enough of the evidence that was submitted to the grand jury to establish probable cause in the opinion of the prosecution, and then what would happen?",
  "You could call witnesses. Could you subpoena witnesses? Could you require the disclosure of the names of government witnesses?",
  "Well, this was an unusual ­­ that's a somewhat unusual situation where you had been ­­ there had already been a trial of someone else who was allegedly involved in the scheme. But what if that was not the case? In the more ordinary situation, what would happen?",
  "There's been a suggestion that, if the judge were to find that there was a lack of probable cause, the prosecutor would be under an ethical obligation to dismiss the charges. Do you agree with that?",
  "And what if it's the same evidence ­­ the same evidence is introduced before the grand jury? Let's say it's a credibility determination. The grand jury finds the prosecution witness credible, the judge finds the prosecution witness not credible. Is there, then, an ethical obligation to dismiss the charges?",
  "Well that’s what ­­ I'm sorry.",
  "But that's what it seems to me this case is all about. All the talk about whether ­­ about defendants being exonerated, that the judge is going to find a lack of probable cause, that's ­­ you know, that's fantasy land for the most part. But what it's really about is about discovery. Prosecutors hate preliminary examinations. When do they ever occur in Federal felony cases? They are always ­­ almost always eliminated by indictment. The defense bar hates grand jury proceedings. They would like to have a preliminary hearing, where they get some discovery of the government's trial case, and that's what this is all about. So it seems to me that what's important is the nature. If there is going to be any kind of a hearing, what is going to take place at this hearing? And what typically happens beyond what I­I mentioned before, a case agent taking the stand and providing some summary of the ­­ of the evidence that was provided to the grand jury? How much further do they go? Is the defense entitled to any discovery? Do they subpoena witnesses?",
  "What do you mean this is the kind of hearing that's held every day? I thought these ­­ in some circuits, it is. But it's held occasionally.",
  "General Schmidt, am I wrong to think that the issue in this case is whether there was compulsion at the time when the statement was made to the ­­ the court­ordered expert?",
  "That's the issue. It's not ­­ it wouldn't be a question of whether there was a violation of the Fifth Amendment privilege at the time when the statements were later introduced in the Kansas trial. Isn't it very well settled in this Court's precedents that the introduction of statements obtained ­­ that the introduction of statements at a trial is not ­­ does not implicate the Fifth Amendment privilege?",
  "Well, that's the issue, as I see it, but maybe I'm wrong ­­ correct me if I'm wrong, and maybe Mr. Katyal will ­­ that the issue is whether there was unconstitutional compulsion at the time when the statements were obtained. But I thought it was very well settled that if there ­­ there wasn't compulsion at that time, then the later introduction of the statements into the ­­ into evidence at the trial does not implicate the privilege against self­incrimination.",
  "So what happened in ­­ in State court really is ­­ is irrelevant to this. This is ­­ everything that ­­ everything important here was done under Rule 12.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and that's ­­ and that's the issue.",
  "Why would that ­­",
  "Yes, sure.",
  "Isn't the question here whether Rule 12.2 is constitutional? Everything that was done here seems to me to have been done in compliance with Rule 12.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, so if there's ­­ insofar as the taking of the statement is concerned, which I'm suggesting is the issue and not the later introduction in the Kansas court. Am I wrong on that?",
  "That would be ­­ that's not a ­­ that's not a self­incrimination question, though, isn't it? It's a due process question. It's an unreasonable limitation on the defendant's ability to put on a defense.",
  "No, but there wouldn't be at that point ­­ suppose the Federal rules simply said you can't have an expert testify about mental condition, period. That's a ­­ that raises a due process issue, and maybe there would be a serious due process question involved.",
  "Okay.",
  "Up to that point, we're not quite at the Fifth Amendment.",
  "Well, suppose we ­­ suppose we agree with you, and the response is the adoption of a new Federal rule of evidence or a State rule of evidence that says that evidence of a ­­ that an expert who testifies for the defense as to the mental ­­ the insanity or mental state of a defendant is very unreliable, if there has not been an opportunity for the defendant to be examined by another expert and, therefore, is just inadmissible. You can't do it at all. Would there be a constitutional problem with that?",
  "Well, why is it that the jacket and the pants in that picture are not clothes?",
  "Well, this is one of the aspects of your argument that seems really puzzling to me. I don't know when ­­ when a human being first got the idea of putting on clothing. I think it was one of the main reasons ­­ probably the main reason was for protection. It's for protection against the cold. It's for protection against the sun. It's for protection against ­­ against thorns. So you want us to hold that items that are worn for purposes of protection are not clothing?",
  "So if it ­­ if it protects against something other than workplace hazard, it can be clothes. But if it protects against a workplace hazard, it isn't clothing. Is that your test? Excuse me.",
  "But what if you are working out in the sun? So you are wearing clothing, so that you don't get burned by the sun. What if you are working out in the cold and you wear a parka, so that you don't freeze while you're working? Are those workplace hazards?",
  "No, but if the union ­­ is it consistent with the union's duty to represent your client for them to bargain away something to which your clients are entitled under the Fair Labor Standards Act?",
  "No, no, the union. If the union ­­",
  "Well, nothing has been said about the word \"changing.\" Maybe you could say something about that. Isn't it ­­ isn't it awkward to refer to the changing of clothes when all that the person is doing is putting on clothing on top of clothing that the person is already wearing?",
  "That's not the way the term is normally used, is it?",
  "What you just said ­­ what you just said, I find quite confusing. I can make a list of things that are considered to be clothing. One of them would be a jacket, perhaps. One would be a vest. And if you tell me that a vest is not clothing if it's made out of metal, then I don't know why Mr. Schnapper is not right that a jacket is not a jacket if it's got extra flame protection ­­ protecting chemicals in it.",
  "But when somebody in the meat packing industry puts on something that would be clothing, but also puts on all these other things that you say are not clothing, now, you would say in that situation putting on all of this additional stuff is not ancillary, and that is for what reason? Because it takes more time in relation to the clothing or the number of non­clothing items exceeds the number of non­clothing items? What does that mean?",
  "What is the practice in the poultry industry to which you referred? Are those unionized workplaces and have they bargained on this issue?",
  "And under ­­ where they have collective bargaining agreements, are they compensated for this time or not?",
  "What do you think the Court meant when it said that the ­­ the article was aimed at California?",
  "When it was distributed, it was distributed everywhere. It was the National Enquirer, so it was probably in every supermarket in the country. And why does California, as an abstract entity, care about an article that makes allegedly defamatory statements about things that people supposedly did in California? I don't quite understand that.",
  "And that would be true, even if the Respondents had never been in Georgia?",
  "Do you think it's relevant in a case like this whether the ­­ the Federal officer who is sued is represented by the Justice Department?",
  "Well, suppose that the plaintiffs in this case were not professional gamblers. Let's say they were Major League umpires, or they are members of a rock group that's going on a tour of 25 cities. Where would there be personal jurisdiction there? In every place where the umpire was going to appear at a game? Every place where the group was going to perform?",
  "Well, here, the ­­ here, the plaintiffs apparently lived in two places, right? California and Nevada.",
  "And suppose my hypothetical rock performer has five houses, one in California, one in Montana, and so forth. He ­­ personal jurisdiction everywhere?",
  "Well, they were sufficiently residents of California to get California driver's licenses, were they not?",
  "Before you move on from that point ­­",
  "­­ your ­­ your argument is dependent on the fact that the officer here knew that the ­­ the plaintiffs were residents of Nevada; is that right?",
  "Why should that make any difference? The conduct is the same; the injury is the same. What if he didn't know? Then there would be no personal jurisdiction.",
  "But, when you're talking about the internet, you're in a different world. But this is a ­­ the facts here are old­fashioned. Everything that happened here could have happened in 1920.",
  "Could have happened in ­­ in the 19th century.",
  "So I don't see what the internet has to do with this.",
  "Well, I don't understand what you're saying. You're saying that we should reverse the Ninth Circuit's dismiss ­­ the dismissal and send it back for the district court to consider whether the case should be transferred?",
  "I know that, so that's why I'm confused by what you're saying about transfer.",
  "Now, this concerns just the risk of nonpersuasion. It doesn't concern the burden of production; is that right?",
  "Well, if that's all that's involved, then the case doesn't seem to amount to quite as much as one might have thought otherwise, does it? If ­­ suppose the ­­ the patentee has the burden of production, so they would have to explain why there was infringement; they would have to introduce proof of infringement. And the only difference is who wins when the ­­ the factfinder thinks that it is exactly in equipoise.",
  "Well, don't you think the word \"treaty\" has some meaning? It is certainly true that, going back to the beginning of the country, there have been many treaties that have been implemented in ways that affect matters that otherwise would be within the province of the States. One of the original purposes of the­­ objectives of the Constitution was to deal with ­­ with a treaty power was to deal with the issue of debts owed to British creditors. And there have been cases about the property rights of ­­ of foreign subjects, about the treatment of foreign subjects here, about things that are moving across international borders, about extradition and all of those. But in all of those, until fairly recently, certainly until, generally, after World War II, all of those concerned matters that are of legitimate concern of a foreign State. That was the purpose of a treaty. So can't we see something in that, in the meaning of a treaty, what it was understood to mean when the Constitution was adopted?",
  "And do you think it would be difficult ­­",
  "Do you think it would be difficult for a judge to ask, is there any possibility that there is any other country in the world that has the slightest interest in how the United States or any of its subdivisions deals with the particular situation that's involved in this case?",
  "Do you think that would be beyond the ­­ that would be beyond the ability of Federal judges when they ­­ when a case like this comes before them?",
  "They're not real ­­ they're not real cases because you haven't prosecuted them yet. If you told ­­",
  "If you told ordinary people that you were going to prosecute Ms. Bond for using a chemical weapon, they would be flabbergasted. It's ­­ it ­­ it's so far outside of the ordinary meaning of the word.",
  "This statute has an enormous ­­ an enormous breadth, anything that can cause death or injury to a person or an animal. Would it shock you if I told you that a few days ago, my wife and I distributed toxic chemicals to a great number of children?",
  "On Halloween, we gave them chocolate bars. Chocolate is poison to dogs, so it's a toxic chemical under the chemical weapons ­­",
  "Whenever ­­ when this Court has issued decisions in recent years holding that there are some limits on Congress' power, cases like Lopez and Morrison and City of Boerne, there have been legal commentators who have written articles saying that could be circumvented to ­­ through the use of the treaty power. Do you agree with that?",
  "Could you ­­ all right. I'll take back the word \"circumvention.\" Could you reach the opposite result? Could it ­­ could Congress regulate the possession of a gun within a school zone by entering into a treaty that authorizes such legislation?",
  "On Dayton, if the only relief available had been reinstatement and back pay, would that matter?",
  "Well, those cases are different. But why is there a ­­ why is there a greater federalism concern in those cases than in this case where the IUB has a legitimate interest in how much citizens of Iowa pay for a telephone service?",
  "But then, if the question is whether something is tied to something that can be regarded as criminal or quasi­criminal, what about Middlesex County? That's not criminal ­­ or is not criminal.",
  "Well, could you give me an example of State administrative proceedings that would Younger?",
  "Well, suppose it's a licensing procedure. Somebody's been denied a license to be a barber or a hairdresser and the person wants to challenge that in Federal court. Would Younger apply there?",
  "Why?",
  "Why not?",
  "Well, suppose there's some ­­ there's an ­­ an administrative agency in the State that hears appeals from that.",
  "Is it correct that, under Eighth Circuit law, the ­­ the party that wants to bring the Federal lawsuit has to go to State court first?",
  "Well, I thought that ­­ I thought that Sprint was ­­ said that they had to go to State court whether they wanted to or not or else they wouldn't be able to go to Federal court.",
  "What do you do with reference to persons?",
  "Well, I ­­ I realize that.",
  "But I'm not sure why that ­­ why it wouldn't make sense to read two different terms in the same sentence to mean two different things.",
  "The persons could be here, the citizens of Mississippi, who were damaged by the activity in question. The plaintiff ­­ plaintiffs, here, there's one named plaintiff. The plaintiffs can refer to ­­ to the person or entity or multiple people or entities who were named as plaintiffs. So why ­­ I don't see what the inconsistency is.",
  "May I ask you about the individual plaintiffs here? And what do we know about them? They, obviously, have appeared at proceedings, and they object to the proceedings. Does the record show that they had matters before the town council during the hearings part of the proceeding?",
  "And what about the public forum part? They did speak, occasionally, then; isn't that right?",
  "Do we know what they spoke about?",
  "And what did they ­­ what was the issue there?",
  "But that's during the public ­­ that's during the public forum part.",
  "Which is not really ­­ it's not the same thing as the hearing.",
  "There's another ­­ there's another part of the proceeding that is the hearing.",
  "And that's when somebody has a specific proposal. They want to ­­ something specifically before the board, and they want relief. They want a variance.",
  "And that is separated in time.",
  "But that is a legislative body at that point. It's clearly a legislative body, is it not? The only ­­ the difference is it's a town rather than ­­ than Congress or a State legislature, where you have more formalized procedures. This is ­­ this is more direct democracy. Or it's like a ­­ it's a town meeting.",
  "Well, if that is your argument, then you are really saying you can never have prayer at a town meeting.",
  "How could you do it? Because that's the kind of thing that always comes up at town meetings.",
  "All right. Give me an example ­­ give me an example of a prayer that would be acceptable to Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus. Give me an example of a prayer. Wiccans, Baha'i.",
  "Well, give me an example then. I think the point about atheists is a good point. But exclude them for present purposes, and give me an example of a prayer that is acceptable to all of the groups that I mentioned.",
  "Give me an example.",
  "To \"the almighty.\"",
  "So if ­­ if a particular religion believes in more than one god, that's acceptable to them?",
  "74a, \"Heavenly father,\" that's acceptable to all religions?",
  "Let me give you an example of a practice that's a little bit different. Maybe you'll say it's a lot different from what the Town of Greece does. First of all, this town starts out by making ­­ by proceeding in a more systematic and comprehensive way in recruiting chaplains for the month or whatever it is. So, instead of just looking to all the houses of worship within the town, it identifies places of worship that may be outside the town boundaries that people within the town who adhere to a minority religion may attend. And it makes it clear that it's open to chaplains of any religious ­­ of any religion on a rotating basis. And then they have ­­ they structure their proceedings so that you have the prayer, and then the legislative part of the town meeting. And then there's a clear separation in time and access between that part of the proceeding and the hearing where variances and things of that nature are held. Now, you would still say that's unconstitutional because you have to add on that a prayer that is acceptable to everybody; is that it? Is there any other problem with what I've just outlined?",
  "Well, that gets exactly to the ­­ that gets exactly to the problem with your argument about nonsectarian prayer. Yes, when ­­ at the beginning of the country, the population was 98 percent­plus Protestant. Then it became predominantly Christian. Then it became predominant ­­ almost exclusively Christian and Jewish. And it ­­ but now, it's not that ­­ it's ­­ it's gone much further than that. So we have a very religiously diverse country. There are a lot of Muslims, there are a lot of Hindus, there are Buddhists, there are Baha'is, there are all sorts of other adherents to all sorts of other religions. And they all should be treated equally, and ­­ but I don't ­­ I just don't see how it is possible to compose anything that you could call a prayer that is acceptable to all of these groups.",
  "And you haven't given me an example.",
  "Well, Marsh is not the source of the government involvement religion in this respect. The first Congress is the source.",
  "The first Congress that also adopted the First Amendment.",
  "Many of them ­­ many of them were very explicitly Christian, were they not?",
  "My ­­ my understanding is that the first chaplain of the Senate was the Episcopal bishop of New York; isn't that correct? And he used to read ­­ he took his prayers from the Book of Common Prayer. That was acceptable to Baptists at the time, Quakers?",
  "Is it your position that employees of any officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor or agent of a public company are covered? They're all covered?",
  "Well, if doesn't ­­",
  "If it doesn't include that, then ­­ then how do you avoid that with your reading of the text?",
  "Well, to go back to Justice Breyer's hypothetical which gets at this point where you have the gardening ­­ the gardening company, privately held, that's working for a public company, and there's some kind of employee of the contractor is fired and claims that the company is engaging in some kind of fraud that has nothing to do with the public company. So you have that situation. Now you have the identical, another privately held gardening company, exactly the same thing is going on, except they don't have a contract with a public company. Why would Congress have wanted to cover the former and not the latter?",
  "But why? If they are concerned with all fraud, why not cover them both?",
  "It's not ­­ it's not unlikely that an employee of a subcontractor will have information about something that can be ­­ that can be alleged to be mail fraud by that ­­ by the contractor, that's not at all unlikely. If you see ­­ you know, if you see some civil RICO complaints, you see the kind of things that are alleged as mail fraud.",
  "Do you disagree with that?",
  "Yes. But you think this is limited to ­­ to fraud by the contractor relating to the public company, not ­­ not fraud that has nothing to do with the public company.",
  "What do you mean while? Temporal ­­ during the same period of time or in relation to?",
  "And where do you see that in the statute?",
  "It says, \"The contractor of such company,\" not \"the fraud of such company.\"",
  "What happens if another Enron situation comes along and the corporation's accounting firm retaliates against an employee of the accounting firm because that employee wants to report illegal activity by the corporation?",
  "What the statute says is \"any conduct,\" \"any conduct which the employee reasonably believes constitutes a violation of Section 1341, '43, '44, or '48.\" Do you see in there any limitation that says that the conduct has to be fraudulent conduct relating to the activities of a publicly held company.",
  "It gives the reference to the subcontractors or to contractors and the subcontractors such a narrow meaning. And except for this concept of the axe­wielding specialist, those provisions mean nothing under that. That's what gives me pause about your interpretation.",
  "My question wasn't clear. If you say that the employees, only the employee of the publicly held company and not the employee of the private ­­ privately held subcontractor, then that ­­ the only situation is covered with respect to the contractor is this so­called axe­wielding specialist.",
  "Yes, it can happen, but it's really very small, isn't it?",
  "Well, give me an example of that. Give us ­­",
  "And I don't ­­ I don't understand the example. The ­­ the alleged aider and abetter learns about this after it's happened? That's the idea?",
  "Well, let me change ­­ let me ­­ maybe this is the same as Justice Scalia's hypothetical, but let me try it. Suppose that two guys have a meeting and it's ­­ it's in a place that's ­­ where there's an electronic eavesdropping device. In fact, there's a camera. So it's all recorded. So we know exactly what was said. And the principal says, here's the deal, I'm going to rob a convenience store and I'm going to carry a gun. And the aider and abetter says, well, all right. I'm in on the ­­ you know, I'm in on robbing the convenience store, but I don't want anything having to do with the gun. I think you should carry a baseball bat. The principal says, no, that's the deal. I'm robbing the store. I'm carrying a gun. Take it or leave it. Are you going to drive me there? And ­­ and the other guy says, I hate guns, I don't want to have anything to do with guns. I ­­ I hate this idea about the guns. They go back and forth. And the ­­ the principal says finally, look, this is it. This is the deal. I'm robbing the store. I'm using a gun. Are you going to help me or not? And the guy says, well, all right. I'm going to drive you, but I want it noted for the record that I'm opposed ­­ I'm opposed to the use of a gun.",
  "See ­­ so I don't really see ­­ I can't ­­ I can't think of a situation where a person facilitates the crime, knows what the crime is going to be, knows that a gun is going to be used but doesn't intend for the gun to be used.",
  "In those two situations, knowledge and intent, seem to me to be ­­ to be the same thing.",
  "Well, I didn’t understand your hypotheticals. If you could give it to us again.",
  "But you facilitate ­­",
  "Or in my ­­ in my hypothetical, could a rational jury say he knew about it, but he didn't intend it?",
  "Well, in my case ­­ and I'll finish. I want to ask another question about this. But in my case, if the judge had given the instruction, it's enough that he knew about it. He facilitated the crime when he knew there was a gun. Would that be error?",
  "I understand your argument about intent, but are you also arguing that the ­­ that the actus reus instruction was insufficient? The instruction about what your client did?",
  "Do you think it's necessary for an aider and abetter to facilitate every element of a criminal offense?",
  "So if there were not ­­ if the ­­ the drug offense itself were not illegal, there ­­ there wasn't a drug offense and then the ­­ the additional firearm element, it wouldn't be necessary for him ­­ for the defendant to facilitate every element of that offense. It's dependent on the fact that there's this other criminal conduct.",
  "Well, let me go back to my earlier hypothetical about the taped conversation. Suppose that the alleged aider and abetter there says, I intend for you to use the gun. I have that intent. However, I'm not going to do one thing to help you get the gun or use the gun. I don't want to ­­ I'm not going to. There's an actus reus problem there because he doesn't facilitate the use of the gun?",
  "Could the defendant here have ­­ could the defendant here have been convicted of possession of the ammunition on the theory that ­­ under the instructions ­­ would the instructions have allowed that conviction on the theory that the defendant aided and abetted somebody else's possession of the ammunition?",
  "Mr. Fisher, I wasn't here for Randolph. I have trouble getting my mind around this entire problem. I would never think of telling my co­tenant that she could not invite her friends or other people into the house. And so I don't understand why the fact that one is a joint tenant is not the end of the analysis. Why shouldn't it be?",
  "Why is it different? Why is it a different question? If I own premises, I can invite in a friend. I can invite in a relative. I can invite in a complete stranger if I want to do that.",
  "Why is it a presumption? It's a right, is it not?",
  "I understand that. Why should it ­­ well, all right. Why should I feel myself bound by that?",
  "You can say that in lots of consent search cases. I don't think that answers the question of whether the person has validly consented. Is there a rule that says you can't have a consent search where there's probable cause because where there's probable cause, you can get a warrant and, therefore, you can't consent to the search? Is there a case that says that?",
  "Well, so why should that be the rule here?",
  "You have a woman who has been beaten up. She's got bruises. She's standing on the doorstep of her house. And she says to the police: I'd like you to come into the house and see evidence of what my husband has been doing to me. And you say she can't do that. She has ­­ it's her house, but she can't invite the police in?",
  "But Jardines was based on an understanding of property rights, wasn't it?",
  "It was based on an understanding of property rights, Jardines?",
  "Well, why doesn't your rule express profound disrespect for the ­­ the cotenant who was standing at the door and who has ­­ who says, I've just been beaten up by my cotenant and I want you to come into my house and see the evidence of what my cotenant has done to me. And you say to that cotenant who's standing by the door you do not have the right to invite the police into your house to look for evidence of what was done to you.",
  "All right. But it would apply in that case, would it not?",
  "Would Mr. Mulhall have to face an imminent threat in order for him to have standing?",
  "And why is the threat imminent at this time?",
  "Why is the threat imminent at this time?",
  "What­­ What is your position now?",
  "Why wouldn't the right to use private property in a way that otherwise wouldn't be allowed constitute a thing of value? Suppose the ­­ what the employer gave the union was a lease well ­­ well below market rate on property for use as the ­­ as a union office. Would that qualify as a thing of value?",
  "So what's the difference here? There's a ­­ there's the use of ­­ there's the conveyance of a certain property right. Why doesn't that constitute a thing of value?",
  "But it's still ­­ it's a lesser property right, but isn't it a property right? What if the ­­ what if the employer sold to a catering company the right to drive lunch trucks onto its premises to sell sandwiches and coffee to the employees? Wouldn't that be a property right?",

  "Well, before you get too much into the merits, could ­­ does the United States have a position on whether this case satisfies Article 3.",
  "I'm not sure that this argument helps you, but it's your argument. But this arbitration took place in the United States because the parties agreed that's where it would take place, right?",
  "So your ­­ your argument is that, by agreeing that the arbitration would take place in the United States, they bought into U.S. arbitration law, no international modification?",
  "See, I would have thought that there would ­­ there'd be an argument for saying that the first options principle shouldn't apply to international ­­ or to a bilateral investment treaty. The whole point of these treaties, as I understand it, is to take these disputes out of the courts because of distrust, at least of the courts of the country against which the claim is asserted and ­­ and put it in an international tribunal where some sort of standard international principles would apply, but that's ­­ you don't like the idea.",
  "Could I ask you just a ­­ a practical question and maybe the answer to this is obvious. Is it too late, now, for you to begin litigation in Argentina? Wait 18 months and then pursue arbitration?",
  "What about this ­­ what about this principle: If something, if some requirement seems to serve virtually no purpose, it's unlikely to be a condition of consent. Would you accept that?",
  "Well, there is nothing in the treaty that talks about consent at all, so we have to decide whether some requirement is a consent, is on something which consent is conditioned, or it's just a procedural requirement that would be decided by an arbitrator. Would you not ­­ would you disagree with the proposition that, if something really is trivial, it doesn't seem to accomplish much of anything, it's a historical vestige, it's unlikely to be a condition of consent.",
  "Well, you said a few minutes ago you were going to explain why this litigation requirement is important. And that is important to me because I don't see what it accomplishes. I can understand a waiting period, but this is more than a waiting period. You have a party who doesn't want to litigate in the ­­ in the courts of Argentina. It doesn't think it's going to get a fair shake there. What is the point of requiring this ­­ now, I understand, it's a requirement. But if it's not very important, if it isn't going to achieve anything, that seems to me to weigh against the conclusion that it's a ­­ that it is a condition of consent.",
  "Let me just interrupt before ­­ before the time expires ­­ but I don't understand ­­ I don't know what the procedure is in Argentina. Let's assume their civil procedure is like ours. So you say they have to file a complaint. All right. They file a one­page complaint. They do the minimal necessary to keep the case alive in court. Maybe they don't even do that because they don't care; they don't want the thing to be ­­ to be decided. All they're doing is running out the 18 months. What is achieved by that?",
  "Well, let's say they avail themselves of the procedure in only the most perfunctory way, so as to satisfy the 18­month requirement. But not for the purpose ­­",
  "You're really ­­ you're not answering ­­",
  "You're not answering my question.",
  "What is ­­ if they do not litigate the matter in ­­ in such a way as to get a decision on any of these local law issues, they just keep it alive, perfunctorily, for 18 months. What is achieved by that?",
  "Well, why is the ­­ why is that important? Why is the issue that you've brought before us important? In addition to the possibility of an Ex Parte Young action, you could certainly arrest people who are running what you believe is an illegal casino in the State, can't you?",
  "But, in addition to that, couldn't you have stopped this before it even started by insisting in the compact that the tribe waive sovereign immunity?",
  "Going forward then ­­",
  "Well, that's a more sophisticated version of my question.",
  "No. Seriously, it gets into a more ­­ more difficult issue.",
  "Well, I understand that.",
  "But going forward, is this of any importance? Why ­­",
  "It seems to me, if a tribe wants to open a casino and the State has to ­­ it has to have a compact with the State, isn't all the bargaining power on the ­­ on the side of the State? So the State says, fine, if you want to do that, you have to waive sovereign immunity?",
  "Well, I ­­ but I mean, when will ­­ when will this compact expire?",
  "If I could just pursue that?",
  "So the compact has expired, and there's ­­ so then how can they operate the casino?",
  "Until they reach a new compact, it continues.",
  "I mean, is ­­ is it not correct that the people who work in these casinos are just employees? They have no other connection with the tribe? Am I wrong on that?",
  "Well, for purposes of sovereign immunity, does it make any difference that you have at least a colorable claim that this is on Indian lands?",
  "Yes. So if your ­­ if your client or another tribe just decided to go into the gaming business all over the country and began opening casinos in places that clearly are not Indian lands, you still would have sovereign immunity.",
  "What remedy ­­",
  "What remedy would a private person have? Suppose a patron of a casino was beaten up by casino employees. What remedy could that person have?",
  "What about ­­ what about private individuals who may have a claim against ­­ as a result of the operation of the casino? Vendors who want to be paid, somebody who slips and falls. That's all barred by sovereign immunity?",
  "Is it the case that ­­",
  "Let me change the hypothetical slightly. Suppose the contract says that one of the parties reserves sole discretion to do something, and then the contract goes on to say, and then, in exercising this discretion, we don't promise to act in a reasonable manner. But the State court says that, nevertheless, that has to be interpreted to mean that the ­­ the party can only perform in a reasonable manner. Then what would the situation be?",
  "Well, let me ask you this: Suppose you have, in Minnesota or one of the States where you say the covenant is simply a way of effectuating the intent of the parties, you have a contract between two very tough and nasty businessmen. And they write right in their contract ­­ you know, we're going to comply with the literal terms of this contract, but we do not promise each other that we're going to proceed in good faith or that we are going to deal with each other fairly. We are going to take every advantage we can under the literal terms of the contract. Now, would that get rid of the covenant under Minnesota law?",
  "Well, how do you account for the fact that, in many States, the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is read into most contracts, but is not read into employment contracts?",
  "Well, doesn't that discrepancy show simply that the State has different policies with respect to those two types of contracts?",
  "Well, an at­will employment contract is a contract that gives the employer sole discretion as to whether to retain an employee. And, here, we have a contract that says that the airline has ­­ has sole discretion to determine whether to terminate somebody from the frequent flyer program. So what is the difference?",
  "May I ask you a question about something slightly different? An amicus brief submitted in support of your position by California and some other States points out, at some length, that there are now a lot of frequent flyer programs in which a lot of miles are earned by making purchases other than for ­­ for flights and in which miles can also be spent for things other than flights. Do we have to worry about that in this case?",
  "Well, what are the facts relating to this particular plan? Can you earn miles by doing things other than flying? Can you spend miles on things other than flying?",
  "I don't want to take up ­­ I don't want to take up your rebuttal time, but, if the facts were that, under a particular program, 90 percent of the miles were earned by purchasing things other than flying and 90 percent of the miles were spent on things other than flying, wouldn't that be very different?",
  "I ­­ I assume you would agree that the manufacturer of the cartridges that compete with Lexmark would have standing here.",
  "But it's not a very big step from the manufacturer of the cartridge that competes to the manufacturer of the chip, which is really the essential component of ­­ or an essential component of the cartridge that competes.",
  "Maybe the answer is when we just can't believe that Congress really meant the literal words of the statute to be interpreted without some limiting principle. So, here, Congress says, \"any person,\" and any person surely includes people who purchase printer cartridges. So if we don't think that ­­ that Congress really meant for every single person who purchases a printer cartridge to be able to file a claim in Federal court with no amount in controversy requirement, then that would be a situation where some consideration of prudential standing would have to take place.",
  "Suppose the comments in this case only disparaged the cartridges themselves and not the chips. Then would the chip manufacturer, would your client have standing?",
  "Well, that may be true, but I don't understand how you get from the zone of interest to the limiting principle that you are suggesting, which is that the zone of interest includes only those businesses, other than the direct competitor, whose products are targeted by the false statements.",
  "All right. Well, to change it, suppose the statements don't implicitly ­­ even implicitly target Static Control, but the effect of the statements is to drive Static Control out of business. You would say there would be no standing there?",
  "All right. So, in Justice Breyer's hypothetical about the soda fountain that sells ice cream with chocolate sauce and there is a statement that the chocolate sauce is poisonous, if the effect of that is to drive out of business a little company that manufactures ice cream that's used there, that company would not have standing?",
  "So if Bailey's was the only place that sold this chocolate sauce, Bailey ­­ Bailey's might have standing. That would be similar to this case. But, if other places also sold this chocolate sauce, then Bailey's is out.",
  "Suppose that Lexmark had not made disparaging comments about Static Control, but had simply made false statements about its own product. Suppose it said that, if you use our products ­­ our cartridges, they will emit some sort of vapor in your house that will promote good health. Who would be within the zone of interest there?",
  "Who would be within the zone of interest? Only ­­ would other printer cartridge manufacturers be within the zone of interest in that situation?",
  "Well, it's not a reasonable interest test then.",
  "Am I correct to think that your rule is that the only people who have standing under the Lanham Act are competitors and people whose products are disparaged? And, if that is true, then are you not “arguably” advocating the most restrictive test for Lanham Act standing, other than the categorical rule?",
  "Well, some military installations are located in very rural areas. Now, suppose you have an installation in such a place and there are buildings and ­­ and facilities that you can see in one part of this territory, but there's a lot of open ­­ there are a lot of open fields around it.

Would he ­­ would he commit a misdemeanor by doing that?",
  "Mr. Horwich, can I ask you this, which is ­­ this question is stimulated by what Justice Kagan asked. Is it ­­ my understanding is that, if you look at many military reservations, you may need a very detailed map to figure out ­­ and a crime is committed someplace on there or other Federal lands ­­ you may need a very detailed map to determine whether criminal jurisdiction over that particular offense is exclusively Federal or Federal and concurrent. Now ­­ and I would assume that that could be true of a military base that is completely sealed off to the public.",
  "Now, do you understand that the ­­ the Ninth Circuit's holding to be based on access or to be based on jurisdiction over crimes that are committed there?",
  "Well, there may be ­­ suppose property is leased to ­­ I don't know whether this actually ever occurs ­­ but suppose it's leased to the United States and used for a military reservation. Would there be exclusively Federal criminal jurisdiction there, or would there not be concurrent jurisdiction?",
  "Right.",
  "Could I just ask you what we should make of this ­­ what we should make of this green line?",
  "What is the significance of the green line?",
  "Really, Mr. Chemerinsky, I didn’t mean to interrupt your sentence. But, I mean, I may own a parcel of property, and I may put up a fence around my property, and I may not put the fence right at the very edge of the property. I may leave a little border between the edge of my property and the place where the fence is. Now, are you saying that I have ceded exclusive control over this area between the fence and the end of the property?",
  "What do you mean by, \"exclusive possession\"? Does the fence have any relevance? What is the relevance of the fence?",
  "But there are bases that have no fences. So what, there? None of that is under the exclusive possession of the government?",
  "I'm still completely confused about the test that you are asking us to ­­ to apply. Either ­­ either fences are relevant or they are not relevant. If you can have exclusive governmental ­­ exclusive military possession of a base where there are no fences, I don't really see what the significance is of the fence here. That's just ­­ that's just for starters.",
  "Well, you are arguing that the military cannot grant an easement across a military installation for the purpose of allowing the public to drive from a point, let's say, to the south to a point to the north, without also granting an easement that would allow people to linger along the road and engage in First Amendment activity. That ­­ is that your argument?",
  "Because I can understand why the military might be willing to say, well, fine, we understand that it would be very inconvenient to make everybody drive around the installation. We'll allow them to drive through, but we do not want people lingering here because that does create security concerns.",
  "Well, Mr. Cohn, on the ­­",
  "Well, on the report that was made here, suppose that the report said that the Respondent ­­ we believe the Respondent is mentally ill, or we believe the Respondent has serious mental problems. Would you ­­ would you make the same argument if that's what was said?",
  "You would?",
  "Well, the facts, as I understand it, were that he became very angry during a test ­­ during a flight simulation test. He took off his headset, pushed back his chair, threw the headset, started cursing at the instructor, and then later, he was ­­ he was showing anger and cursing for a period of time in other parts of the facility. Does it go beyond that? Is that fair?",
  "All right. And you think, based on that, you could say, we believe this man is mentally ill?",
  "My understanding of what the Colorado supreme court did is this: On the issue of ATSA immunity, it said, very clearly, that is for the court. And it says, in footnote 5, it may ­­ it gives no weight to the jury's findings of fact with respect to the facts that it found on the immunity question. And then, at the end of footnote 6, what it said was, having found that there is no immunity, then it was proper for the trial judge to submit the defamation issue to the jury, and the jury made findings on the defamation issue. Is that ­­ is that your understanding as well?",
  "And are they right that, in determining ATSA immunity, the jury has no role, doesn't make findings of historical fact, who said what, anything like that?",
  "Well, before you get to that ­­ before you get to that, to finish up on the point you were making earlier. Suppose that the report is he ranted for 10 minutes, and then suppose the jury found he ranted for 7 minutes. Now, maybe those 3 minutes would make a difference ­­ make a difference in the impression on the TSA. That would be enough, in your view?",
  "Well, on two of the ­­ on two of the three statements, the difference between the literal ­­ the very strict truth and what was said is very slight. But you dispute that on ­­ they'd said he's an FFO officer, and he may be armed.",
  "That's literally true. It's literally true. He's an FFO officer. He has a gun. He may be armed.",
  "And what would be a true statement?",
  "Not with respect to the lawyer; with respect to your client.",
  "But you're talking about a very subtle implication of the statement. And I agree with you, there's an implication there that may not be justified, but you're talking about something very subtle in ­­ in the context of ­­ of someone making a call to report a possible threat.",
  "Wouldn’t you think it makes a difference we're talking here about a pilot? I mean, my impression of pilots is that they are supposed to remain perfectly calm, even when terrible things happen. Well, all the ­­ you know, all engines are on fire and one of the wings has fallen off, but ­­ you know, you don't start ranting and screaming. And so someone described him as acting in a manner that was more unprofessional than they had ever seen. Do you think that makes a difference?",
  "But maybe for ordinary people, but how about for pilots?",
  "Do you think the district court here relied solely on the contract ­­ on the contract and on ERISA, or just on ERISA, in awarding these fees? Alito, that the district court relied only on the statute. That was the only ­­ only thing that the court cited. The court didn't cite the contract. It was the court of appeals that sort of reconceptualized it as a case in which fees were awarded under a contract.",
  "Mr. Himmelfarb, if ­­ if I think that we should aim for the rule that trips up the fewest lawyers, what rule would that be?",
  "So on auditor's fees or anything that might possibly be viewed as falling into the same category as attorneys' fees, you can wait. That would trip up the fewest lawyers; is that right?",
  "No, right. But ­­ but if you don't ­­ you can wait and contest those things at a later time when you file ­­ when you appeal from the attorneys' fees?",
  "If we have a different rule for statutory fees and contractual fees, will we have problems in some cases ­­ and maybe this is an example ­­ in determining whether an award of fees was based on a contract or based on the statute? Here, the district judge's opinion on fees says a lot about ERISA, and I don't see any references to the contract in there.",
  "I thought, also, ERISA, too.",
  "Yes.",
  "But your reading of this statute gives (h)(3) a very, very narrow scope; isn't that correct? And I just want to see if I understand exactly how narrow it is. It would apply ­­ first of all, does it apply to any employment­based or diversity­based petitions?",
  "All right. It applies to an F2A petition filed by a legal permanent resident on behalf of that person's spouse; right? And ­­ and if that ­­ if they have a minor child, then the minor child would be a derivative.",
  "Benefit sharing.",
  "Suppose there are two ­­ suppose there are two lawful permanent residents who are exactly the same, except that one has a minor child and one has an adult unmarried child. So the latter files an F2B petition and gets in line on a particular date, right? Then the former, the lawful permanent resident, who has an unmarried ­­ who has a minor child, files an F2A petition and gets in that line. But then by the time the date comes up, the child has aged out, and so, now, you would say that would be converted to an F2B petition.",
  "But the person would be ­­ the child would be at a much lower point, right, than the first one? Why would Congress have wanted that?",
  "Right. And the other one would be higher up.",
  "Oh, okay. I see. Thank you.",
  "But is your real quarrel here with ­­ with the idea of an appropriate category or with the automatic conversion? On the Respondents' view, why isn't there an automatic conversion? Because they say that, as soon as the person ages out, they can be moved into ­­ into another category. That sounds like it's automatic.",
  "Well, why isn't it automatic?",
  "But automatic just means something occurs without anybody having to initiate the change.",
  "So why isn't there ­­ why isn't it automatic here?",
  "So you're saying ­­ you're saying that these things would happen ­­ do I understand you correctly, these things ­­ or most of these same things would happen in the cases in which the government says there is automatic conversion?",
  "Ms. Lenz, am I correct, the instruction that was requested but not given was as follows, quote, \"A defendant is not compelled to testify and the fact that the defendant did not testify should not prejudice him in any way.\" That was the instruction?",
  "So suppose that the ­­ you put on evidence of ­­ to show that he was qualified for the death penalty and put on evidence of aggravating factors, and the defense put on absolutely no mitigation evidence. The instruction would say, would it not, that the fact that the defendant did not testify should not prejudice him in any way with respect to the failure to put on any mitigation evidence at all; is that correct?",
  "Well, when a party has the burden of producing evidence on something, isn't the customary way of dealing with that to instruct the jury that the defendant had the burden of producing evidence to show this, rather than to ­­ to talk about inferences that can be drawn from their failure, from that party's failure to produce evidence.",
  "Well, the jury was instructed, \"You shall consider such mitigating or extenuating facts and circumstances as have been presented to you in the evidence and you believe to be true.\" Now, I suppose they could have been ­­ the mitigating evidence could have been put in by the prosecution, but for the most part, they're going to be put in by the defense. So when the judge says you can consider whatever mitigating evidence has been presented to you, isn't that tantamount to saying that the defendant has the burden of producing evidence of mitigation, if the defendant wants to do that?",
  "Let me ­­ let me give you this example. Let me pretend to be a juror in a ­­ in a Kentucky capital case. And the ­­ and let's assume in this case the prosecution puts on evidence to show eligibility and some evidence of aggravating factors. The defense puts on no evidence of mitigation. Now, the judge tells me you shall consider such mitigating or extenuating facts and circumstances as have been presented to you in the evidence, and you believe to be true. Okay? That's Instruction Number 4. I assume that you don't have an objection to that. And then the judge gives the instruction that you requested, a defendant is not compelled to testify, and the fact that the defendant did not testify should not prejudice him in any way. So, now, I'm back in the jury room, and I say, well, now I have to consider mitigating evidence. And ­­ you know, there are a lot of things that could be mitigating in a capital case. I'd like to know about the defendant's childhood. I'd like to know whether the defendant was ­­ was abused. I'd like to know whether the defendant was remorseful. And I haven't heard anything about this. And I don't know what to do because the judge told me I should consider the mitigating evidence that's been presented to me. On the other hand, the judge told me that the failure ­­ the fact that the defendant didn't put on any mitigating evidence can't prejudice him in any way. So what am I supposed to do?",
  "No, it doesn't really. It says the fact that he didn't testify, and he could have testified about child ­­ about his childhood or about remorse or any of these other things, that shouldn't prejudice him in any way.",
  "Well, just tell me what I'm supposed to do as a juror. The judge says consider the evidence that's put before you, but the fact that the defendant didn't put this evidence before you in the form of his testimony shouldn't prejudice him in any way. I'm ­­ I'm pulled in two different directions. I don't know what to do.",
  "Well, what it may show is that the prosecutor didn't think that it was going to make a difference, and so why raise an objection that could create everything that's happened since then, over something that isn't going to make a difference in a case where you have an incredibly heinous crime? The prosecutor may have thought, this jury is going to return the verdict that I want anyway, even if this instruction is given.",
  "You don't think that's a possibility?",
  "What do you think is the worse adverse inference they might have drawn?",
  "Excuse me. Let me give you this example. Suppose a child is abducted at ­­ at age one and is concealed for 10 years, and then the location of the child is discovered. The other parent files a petition. So that, if there's equitable tolling, the petition was filed within one year. But during those 10 years, the child has become very well settled in the new country, has learned the language of that country, the customs developed, gone to school, developed relationships, and so forth. Under ­­ if there is no equitable tolling, but the abduction can be taken into account under the doctrine of equitable discretion, that's ­­ that's one thing. But the way you read this, the way you read the Convention, the equitable tolling would mean that the petition was filed within a year, and unless one of the conditions in Article 13 was met, for example, a grave risk that the child's return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation, then there would be ­­ then the child would have to be removed. So there is that major difference, isn't there, between those two positions?",
  "Well, that's true. The position of the Respondent and the government would give a great incentive for parents to abduct children and hide them for a period of time. But on the other side, as my example, I think, illustrates, your rule would mean that a child who is very well settled in a particular location would have to be returned to the other country for purposes of the custody determination. So why do you think the Convention should be read one way, rather than the other?",
  "Well, how would it not?",
  "But what ­­ what troubles me about your position is that it undermines the best interests of children in a very powerful way, insofar as it does not deter and, indeed, encourages ­­ provides a great incentive for parents to abduct their children. And that was the central purpose of the Convention, to prevent harm to children and also to parents, but centrally to children who are abducted. And if you have a rule that says if you can abduct the child and you can hide for a year, which isn't very difficult, then all you have to do is provide some evidence of settlement, and you are going to ­­ you are going to win, you are going to deter return. Am I wrong to be concerned about that?",
  "Well, all right. Perhaps that's the solution to the problem then. I wonder if you would accept that, that there is no equitable tolling, let's assume for the sake of argument, but abduction is a strong factor that weighs against the return, that weighs against the failure to return the child, not just something that can be disposed of in a sentence, which is basically what the district court did here, but a very strong factor that has to be taken into account in the exercise of equitable discretion. Would you disagree with that?",
  "Well, you ­­ you're confusing me. Let's say I'm the judge who has to decide this. The one­year period has just past, and I have evidence that this child who is now two years old has some friends, goes to play with the friends, goes to the park, has become accustomed to some American customs, knows the neighborhood. So the child is settled to that degree. And you say even if there's been very elaborate ­­ a very elaborate effort of concealment, no proffered justification for the abduction, no indication that there would be any serious harm if the child were sent back to the U.K., you say that's just too bad. That's your answer?",
  "I don't know what sense ­­ I don't know what sense that makes. Let's say a child is abducted in Mexico, and let's say that the parent who is left behind is not a rich or sophisticated person, and now, the child is brought to the United States. And the parent in Mexico has a year to find the child in the United States, doesn't speak English, can't easily find a lawyer to handle the case. He's got an enormous country to try to find the child in the United States. How in the world is that going to be done?",
  "You don't need to do very much concealment. You can go to Peoria. You can go to New York City, and ­­ and it's going to be an enormous struggle to find that child within a year.",
  "Well, let me ask you about the premise. A vacancy is something that begins at a particular point in time, and then it continues for some period. And I was trying to think of some other things that might fall into the same category. One would be an appointment to a Federal office. So you were appointed as Solicitor General at a particular point in time, and the appointment continues. Another example might be a marriage. It happens at a particular point in time, and it continues for a ­­ a period of time. Now, would we say that your appointment as Solicitor General is happening today and will happen again tomorrow and happened yesterday? Is that the way the English language is used?",
  "But you are making a very, very aggressive argument in favor of executive power now, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with whether the Senate is in session or not. You're just saying, when the Senate acts, in your view, irresponsibly and refuses to confirm nominations, then the President must be able to fill those ­­ fill those positions. That's what you're arguing. I don't see what that has to do with whether the Senate is in session.",
  "Well, there's no practice ­­ there is no long practice of doing it. There is also no long practice of rejecting it. But if I could take you back to that, you said that the pro forma sessions may violate the Adjournment Clause in the Twentieth Amendment. Would you also say that they violate the Presentment Clause, because the Senate has passed legislation during these pro forma sessions and the President has signed that legislation.",
  "But where does this 3­day rule ­­",
  "Well, what is significant is whether they're available to confirm nominees; isn't that right?",
  "So suppose they say, instead of no business will be conducted, no nominations will be considered.",
  "I know it would be a different case, but ­­",
  "So what? The point of the question is whether they're available to consider nominations. So if they say, we'll do other business, but no nominations will be considered, why isn't it exactly the same for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause?",
  "Can I ask you a variant of the question that Justice Scalia asked General Verrilli? Suppose we think that the language in the Constitution is perfectly clear in some respect, but that there is a 200­year­old consistent practice, agreement by the President, going back to Washington and by the Senate that the language actually means something else. What would we do in that situation?",
  "On the first question, does your argument depend on the fact that ­­ on the assumption that the ­­ the possibility of a lengthy intra­session break was never even contemplated by those who framed and ­­ and ratified the Constitution? Because if they had thought about that, there's a real chance the Senate may take a two­month break ­­",
  "­­ over Christmas. Would there be any reason why they wouldn't have wanted the recess appointment power to apply there as well as at the end of the session?",
  "I'm ­­ I'm not sure I understand the answer. If the purpose is to permit the President to fill vacancies when the Senate is unavailable to consider nominations and the country would be harmed by having these offices vacant for a period of time, why would that not apply to any lengthy break, whether it's at the end of the session or in the middle of the session? And so if you're arguing that it only applies at the end of the session, doesn't that depend on the assumption that they never thought about the possibility that there would be a lengthy break in the middle of the session?",
  "Well, if we agree with you on the first question, then there needs to either be a number or a functional test. And I don't know where the number would come from and I don't know how the functional test would play out, so maybe you could say just a word about that.",
  "The presence of that in the Adjournments Clause but the absence of any number in the Recess Appointments Clause, how do you explain that?",
  "I am somewhat taken aback by your constant reference ­­ your repeated references to \"wards of the State.\" What we're talking about is whether your client gets $75,000. Do you think everybody who doesn't have $75,000 is a ward of the State?",
  "Yes. Well, do you ­­ do you know what the ­­ the median net worth of a household in the United States is?",
  "It's less than $70,000. So the question here is not whether he's going to be a ward of the State. The question is whether he's going to be above the median in his assets.",
  "What was ­­ what was the trustee supposed to do?

I better stop because, otherwise, I'm going to be working free. What should he do?",
  "In the Malley case, Justice Souter said that if this is not what Section 105(a) was intended for, it's hard to see what Section 501(a) was intended for. I take it you just think he's flatly wrong.",
  "So you're saying a creditor could not have objected when your client claimed the exemption on the ground that the exemption is going to prevent the discovery ­­ the disclosure of the fraudulent nature of this mortgage. The creditor could not have objected to the exemption on that basis?",
  "And why is that?",
  "Well, Mr. Hellman said that the creditor and, I guess, any other party could not object to the exemption on the ground that the house was burdened with a fraudulent mortgage. Do you agree with that?",
  "Do you have any authority that says that there could be an objection on that basis?",
  "Well, under Section 1912, the government could ­­ did reserve an interest for a public highway; is that correct?",
  "No?",
  "Could I ask you again about Section 912? Your patent says that it is subject to those rights for railroad purposes as have been granted to the railway company in particular, and its successors and assigns. Now, that was ­­ that patent came after the enactment of 912, and 912 clarifies the rights of ­­ or changes the rights of railroad companies and says that if they abandon property, within one year after that, they ­­ there can be a public highway established on that ­­ on that property. So why wasn't your patent subject to that?",
  "Well, you didn't get your property from the railroad. You got it from the government.",
  "You got a patent from the government. So the question is: What were they conveying to you? And if you read the patent in connection with 912, isn't it clear they're conveying to you every ­­ arguably everything other than this right to have a public highway established on that land when it was abandoned by the railroad?",
  "I still don't understand it. You say this was purely an easement. All right. So that means that when there's an abandonment, the government has complete title to the property, right? They convey that property to you, but before they do that, they say that there's this reservation of rights with respect to the establishment of a highway.",
  "That's your argument, isn't it?",
  "Yes. Okay. And may be ­­",
  "It may be a good argument.",
  "But that's your argument.",
  "Mr. Yang, I have to say I think the government gets a prize for understatement with its brief in this case. You have a sentence in your brief that says, \"We acknowledge that there is language in this Court's opinion in Great Northern and in the government's brief in that case that lends some support to petitioner's contrary argument.\" Here are the subject headings of the government's brief in Great Northern. \"The right­of­way granted by the Act of March 3, 1875, is in the nature of an easement. The language of the 1875 Act shows that only an easement was granted. The legislative background and history of the 1875 Act show that the grant was of an easement rather than a fee. Subsequent administrative and congressional construction confirm that only an easement was granted.\" And the first sentence of the summary of the argument ­­",
  "That may be.",
  "But the term \"easement\" is a well­known term with an established meaning. And you're saying that ­­ you said it was an easement. The Court said it was an easement. You ­­ you persuaded the Court to say it was an easement. And now you're saying this is some kind of property right that has no name, previously unknown to the law.",
  "Do we know how many miles of public roads and how many miles of bike trails have been ­­ you don't know that either?",
  "Here's something ­­ I'm sorry. Here's something that happens every day. A district judge refers to a magistrate judge a motion for summary judgment. The magistrate judge issues a report and recommendation. The district judge reviews it de novo and may agree or disagree. If it agrees, the district court will enter summary judgment. I don't see a difference other than a purely semantic difference between that situation and what happened here.",
  "But none of that is involved in this case. We have this case in front of us. We don't have every other possible case that could implicate this issue. We have one case and it involves summary judgment. And so there isn't ­­ there are no findings of fact, and there is no substantive difference between a district court's reviewing a report and recommendation on summary judgment and what happened here. I ­­ I have heard nothing other than formalities.",
  "Well, why do they matter for Article III? Maybe they matter for statutory reasons. Why do they matter for Article III? What your client got was exactly ­­ substantively exactly what your client would have gotten had this been referred to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation.",
  "May I ask you to clarify what you're saying about the constitutionality of the Magistrates Act? Are you saying that it is unconstitutional insofar as it allows magistrate judges to try matters by consent, or are you saying further that it is unconstitutional insofar as it allows a district judge to refer a dispositive matter to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation subject to de novo review, or both?",
  "The former is not implicated in this case.",
  "I see.",
  "What if the payments were not keyed to the length of service and to salary? It was just a flat severance payment.",
  "Well, in the Coffy case, the Court drew a distinction between compensation for services and payments that are contingent on the employee's being thrown out of work. But that ­­ why doesn't that apply here?",
  "What if Section 3402(o) did not exist? Would these severance payments fall within FICA's definition of wages then?",
  "And why not?",
  "Well, the government explains 3402(o) on the ground that there had been prior admin ­­ IRS administrative decisions exempting certain types of SUB payments from the definition of wages. And that ­­ that can explain that language. The language that they are ­­ that SUB payments are to be treated as if they were wages doesn't necessarily mean that all of those SUB payments are not wages. It does necessarily mean that at least some of them ­­ or suggests at least some of them are not wages. So what's wrong with the government's explanation of the language along those lines.",
  "Does the record show how many clinics in the State are covered by the law?",
  "one of the examples that is given in one of the amicus briefs in this case, and they ­­ they provide a lot of background, is a State law that creates a buffer zone around every fraternal lodge. What would you say about that?",
  "Well, they haven't entirely eliminated speech because employees are permitted ­­",
  "­­ to speak within the scope of their employment; isn't that right?",
  "May I ask you a question about a distinction that is in this statute? Now, let me give you this ­­ this example. A woman is approaching the door of a clinic, and she enters the zone. Two other women approach her. One is an employee of the facility, the other is not. The first who is an employee of the facility says, good morning. This is a safe facility. The other one who's not an employee says, good morning, this is not a safe facility. Now, under this statute, the first one has not committed a crime; the second one has committed a crime. And the only difference between the two is that they've expressed a different viewpoint. One says it's safe; one says it's not safe. Now, how can a statute like that be considered viewpoint­neutral?",
  "Well, that's what she ­­ what she's doing is what she's saying. She approaches and she says this is a safe facility. The other one says it's not a safe facility. They have a bad safety record. And they're ­­ they're the only people in the zone.",
  "If it's as big as this courtroom, they're the only three people in that zone.",
  "The difference is a viewpoint difference.",
  "Well, you could have created a completely silent zone. Now, I don't know whether that would be permissible or not, but it would be a different question. You could have ­­ you could say nobody can speak here. People can shovel snow. If they work for the ­­ for the clinic, they can sweep the sidewalk, they can do maintenance, they can go in and they ­­ and out, but they can't utter a word. Well, that would be a different statute. But that's not this statute. This statute says that there is an exemption for employees of the facility if they are operating within the scope of their employment. And surely coming out and saying this is a safe facility is within the scope of their employment.",
  "So how do you justify that? Forget about the conduct now. The speech that's allowed. One can speak and say it's safe. The other cannot speak and say it is not safe.",
  "You think it's incidental? What if there's a real question about whether this is a safe facility? That's incidental speech?",
  "Well, before you sit down, can I ask you this question that's suggested by the AFL­CIO briefs. Suppose the State legislature has hearings, and they say there's a long history of violence and obstruction at sites where there is a strike and replacement workers have been called in. Could the ­­ could a State pass a statute that says there is a 35­foot zone like this around every location in the State whenever there is a strike and there are replacement workers? Could they do that?",
  "All right. Could Federal law do that?",
  "In every case, in every case ­­",
  "­­ there could just be a flat rule. Doesn't matter whether there is any history at that place, any indication there's going to be violence. Maybe there will, maybe there won't. Across the board, a zone around every place where there's a strike.",
  "You don't think there's a history ­­ you don't think there's a history of violence at places where there are strikes and replacement workers?",
  "That's not my understanding of the labor history.",
  "Well, how far do you think ­­ what do you think a State legislature or Congress needs to find in order to establish a zone around some category of facility at which there ­­ they have some evidence that there have been some disruptions and some obstruction?",
  "Take the example of ­­ I think it's ­­ it's a real ­­ real ordinance someplace you can't have, there's a buffer zone around fraternal lodges.",
  "What would they have to find? Or slaughterhouses. Or labor ­­ or sites where there are strikes.",
  "What kind of a record do they need? Could ­­ could there be a State law that says no picketing around any ­­ you can never have a picket around any store to try to prevent people ­­ to tell people don't go ­­ don't patronize this store. Could they do that? Isn't that Thornhill v. Alabama?",
  "Right.",
  "Well, I mean, I understand. Stop. I'll ask this one more time.",
  "I think it's ­­ I understand the ­­ the desire to create a buffer zone around certain sensitive facilities. What I'm asking is: What requirements, if any, does Congress or a State legislature have to meet before they can do that? If it is done, do we simply say they ­­ they have a rational basis for it and that's it, so they can establish basically a buffer zone around any kind of a facility they want. If not, then what needs to be established?",
  "One more thing. What about the example of a strike? There certainly is a long history of labor violence in places where there are replacement workers. Could that ­­ could it be done in that situation across the board?",
  "And one of Respondent's arguments is that Congress may have enacted this on the assumption that we were not going to go off with this modified categorical approach that we have created. Is that correct?",
  "Well, I realize that in this area we're supposed to forget anything about what we might actually know about the real world, but are there really a lot of cases in which one spouse is convicted for offensive touching of another spouse? If I search the books, will I find these?",
  "Where the facts ­­",
  "­­ are that there is nothing more than an offensive touching?",
  "Well, if you want to send Congress back to the drawing board, what could they do? I mean, they are stuck, because they have the laws of the States that are framed the way the laws of the States are. And how are they going to ­­ and they can't ­­ and if they can't, if they are stuck with this modified categorical approach, how could they identify those State prosecutions that fall within the parameters that you just outlined.",
  "Other than that, what could they do?",
  "How would you ­­ how would you identify those without changing the assault and battery statutes of the ­­ of the 50 States?",
  "So all the States would have to go back and change their statutes in order to ­­ to segregate the cases that within the parameters that you ­­",
  "­­ that you think are required.",
  "Well, Mr. Messenger, I'm confused by this whole line of argumentation. I didn't think there was any issue in this case about the right of the plaintiffs or any of the other affected workers to say whatever they want on their own. That ­­ they're not prohibited from doing that, are they?",
  "So there isn't any issue about that in the case. I thought the issue ­­ and they can try to ­­ to meet with anybody they want as many times as they want. I suppose that ­­ that person has a perfect right to say: Enough is enough; I don't want to meet with you for the fifth time or for the first time. I thought the issue was whether they could be required to pay for somebody else to go and speak and possibly say things that they disagree with.",
  "Mr. Messenger, do you think the issue of exclusive representation is inextricably tied to the issue of the assessment of an agency fee? Can't you have the former without the latter?",
  "I thought the State took the position that these individuals are State employees for one purpose only, collective bargaining. Isn't that their position?",
  "So if one of these individuals commits gross misconduct, causes the death of a patient, the State has no liability?",
  "Mr. Smith, what I don't understand is why the union's participation in this is essential. The State can say, this is how much these people are being paid ­­ it's not enough, we want to increase it, we want to increase it by 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent, whatever it is. They need some ­­ they should have extra benefits. Well, we'll give them these benefits and these benefits and these benefits. Why do they need to have the union intervene here?",
  "Well, that ­­ that's fine for the workers who want the union to represent them in making these demands on the State. Let me give you this example, which I think gets to what the ­­ the plaintiffs in this case find disturbing. Let's say this is ­­ this involves a teachers union. So the teachers union is negotiating about the issue of tenure and merit pay, and the union is opposed to any change in the tenure system, it's opposed to merit pay. Okay. Now, there's a teacher who's not a member of the union who disagrees completely with the union on these issues, but this teacher ­­ and the teacher is not a member of the union, but still has to pay a pretty hefty agency fee, maybe $700 a year. So the teacher is paying this money to the union to make an argument to the employer with which the teacher completely disagrees. Now, if this teacher just wants to get back to a neutral position, the teacher is going to have to spend $700 or maybe $500 of his or her own money, pay that to another organization that will present that teacher's point of view to the employer. How can that be ­­ what would you say to that, to that teacher? That ­­ you know, You have a right to be ­­ you have a right to say whatever you want on these issues, but you don't have a right to be a teacher?",
  "Mr. Smith, are you saying that this ­­ that the unions reluctantly accept the duty of being the exclusive representative for all the employees? They don't really want to do this, but the law requires them to do this, but because the law requires them to do this, then they have to get this agency fee? Is that really ­­ is that realistically what happens?",
  "Seriously, the unions do not want to have the ­­ they don't want to be given the status of the exclusive bargaining agent for the employees?",
  "What about the issue of ­­",
  "Well, let me ask you a question about pensions. Now, that's a very big public policy issue. I think, in Illinois, the legislature recently cut pensions of ­­ of public employees. That would be a subject ­­ that could be a subject of ­­ of collective bargaining, right? So that would be ­­ bargaining on that would be chargeable?",
  "Well, if the ­­ if the union spends a lot of money trying to bargain on that issue, that's ­­ that's a chargeable expense, is it not?",
  "All right. Now, what do you say to the young employee who is not very much concerned at this point about pensions, but realizes there's a certain pot of money, and it's either going to go for pensions, or it's going to go for salary at the present time. So that employee who's not a member of the union has to pay for the union to bargain with the ­­ the State to achieve something that's contrary to that person's interest. But you say that person is a free rider.",
  "If the plaintiffs in this case worked in a unionized ­­ excuse me ­­ in a unionized Federal workplace, would they be assessed a mandatory agency fee?",
  "So the Federal government doesn't think that it needs to assess a mandatory agency fee from, let's say, the ­­ the employees in the Border Patrol, in order to make sure that the Border Patrol has high morale, sufficient salary, sufficient benefits, it can do without the agency fee in that situation?",
  "Do you think that the specific factual background of what occurred here provides a basis for skepticism about Illinois' reason for adopting this?",
  "I thought the situation was that Governor Blagojevich got a huge campaign contribution from the union and virtually, as soon as he got into office, he took out his pen and signed an executive order that had the effect of putting ­­ what was it, $3.6 million into the union coffers?",
  "That's the sequence; isn't that correct?",
  "Is it true that, from ­­ from the beginning, there have been members of this Court who have questioned whether there is any principle basis for distinguishing between the chargeable and the nonchargeable expenses and also have questioned whether as a practical matter that can be done? Justice Marshall made that argument, did he not.",
  "Should we see anything in the particular way this provision is worded? It says, \"No civil action shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within 3 years after the claim accrued.\" It doesn't say, \"Any civil action may be maintained if it is commenced within 3 years after the claim occurred.\"",
  "So it doesn't ­­ you know, it says ­­ it says you can't do it, unless it's within three years, but it doesn't say that, if it's within three years, you’re home­free.",
  "If we search ­­ if we search every Federal ­­ every reported Federal decision since 1938, how many would we find in which the Court recognized the available of laches as a defense to a claim for legal relief?",
  "Excuse me. I'm sorry. Could I ask you what you mean by an \"anonymous tip\"? Suppose somebody calls up 911 and gives a name? Does that make it not an anonymous tip?",
  "Well, how would you corroborate it? Let's say the person calls up and gives a name and gives an address? So what would be necessary? What would the police have to do then before they could stop the vehicle, other than observing the vehicle do something illegal?",
  "If we transport the standard context, what would happen in this situation? A person calls up and says, this is my name, this is my address and it's ­­ it's not blocked by caller ID, so the 911 operator can see that that's the name, that's the address. The person says, this guy ran me off the road. The police find the vehicle. They drive behind the vehicle for a while. They don't ­­ they don't see any ­­ they don't see any violation. So then they think, well, this guy must have lied. So are they going to prosecute the guy for calling ­­ calling that in?",
  "I mean, your argument goes well beyond. You're saying this has to do with anonymous tips, but it really goes well beyond anonymous tips. It covers tips where you know exactly who called in, and what you're saying is that they really can never stop a vehicle no matter what kind of a tip they get, unless they see the vehicle committing an illegal act. That's the argument.",
  "Well, give me an example of a situation in which the police can pull somebody over after receiving a tip without actually seeing the vehicle commit an illegal act?",
  "Well, how would somebody ­­ how would somebody ever be able ­­ who observes another car driving ever be able to say that person was drunk? All they could ­­ all they could observe is what they see. They don't know whether the person ­­ what is causing that kind of behavior.",
  "Well, why is it limited to drunk driving? I don't understand that. I've been ­­ I've been on an expressway, and I've had people go by me at ­­ they went by in a blur. They must have been going well over a hundred miles an hour. Now, if the police catch up with that person, of course, the person's going to slow down while the police follow the person. And then when the police decide to stop, they're going to go back to engaging in this intentional, extremely dangerous conduct. So I don't understand why there's a distinction between reporting that somebody necessarily is driving erratically, so the person may be impaired, and somebody who is ­­ where you have extremely reckless driving that's intentional.",
  "Well, I find that unsatisfactory because if you ­­ unless you're willing to say, it doesn't matter whether it's a bomb, an atomic bomb, a little bomb, then there ­­ there must be ­­ if you're going to draw the line someplace, then you're going to have to distinguish between those reports of crimes that are serious enough to be on one side of the line and those reports of a crime that are not serious enough to be on that side of the line. You either have to go all the way, or you have to draw a line, and if you're going to draw a line, I would like to know where the line is.",
  "All right. Forget about reasonable suspicion. Just can it be done?",
  "You can say it can never done, even if it's an atomic bomb, even if it's some other type of bomb. You can say that. Or you can say, no, there's a line someplace. If you're going to say there's a line someplace, then, really, I think you need to tell us where the line is.",
  "For a bomb. For any kind of a bomb?",
  "It has to be a big bomb.",
  "Well, in the gift ­­ in the gift situation. But Congress requires certain information from the buyer, whatever that means; right?",
  "The ­­ the dealer has to record the name of the buyer; right?",
  "And the address of the buyer?",
  "And do an instant check on the buyer?",
  "Now, why would ­­ why would this Congress have wanted those things with respect to the person who was just the straw purchaser and not the person who ­­ the person who's actually going to acquire the weapon?",
  "Why wouldn't they be concerned about the starting point? Let's say there's a man, Mr. Straw, and he holds himself out as a gun buyer, he puts ­­ you know, a website, he creates a website. He puts something in the Yellow Pages under \"Straw Man.\" And he says: You want to acquire a gun and you don't want the dealer to record your name and you don't want to have an instant check on you, you come to me. And so these people come to him, and whenever they do, he goes to Joe's gun shop and ­­ with the other person. He says, I want to buy a gun, but this fellow with me is going to do all the talking. So the guy who's with him talks with Joe about different types of guns, costs and everything. After that's done, the person who's done all the talking says, now, my friend, Mr. Straw, is going to buy this gun. He gives Mr. Straw the money, Mr. Straw buys the gun, and the dealer writes down Mr. Straw's name for the fifteenth time that month, his address, does another instant check on it. What sense does that make.",
  "You still have not explained what purpose is served by obtaining the name of the straw purchaser and doing an instant check on the straw purchaser. You said that it allows the tracing of the weapon, but that's not going to be true in the case of a straw purchaser because the person ­­ the straw purchaser, isn't necessarily and probably in the vast majority of cases isn't going to get the name or any information about the actual recipient. That's the whole purpose of having a straw purchaser. So then what purpose is served by this? It's just meaningless.",
  "So they find the gun dealer and the gun dealer says, I sold it to Mr. Straw. And then they go to Mr. Straw and Mr. Straw said: My client took it. Okay, who's your client? I have no idea. He came into my store. You know, He contacted me. I didn't ask his name. He didn't give me his name. And that's the end of it. So no purpose is served by putting down the name, the address, doing the check on the straw purchaser.",
  "Well, what you're saying is they did a meaningless thing. That was the compromise. They would do something that's utterly meaningless.",
  "If we disagree with you on the first point about the straw purchaser, would you ­­ would you lose on the grounds that Mr. Abramski's uncle could not have lawfully purchased the gun at that store because he wasn't a resident of the State?",
  "But he couldn't have taken possession of it in ­­ in Pennsylvania.",
  "In Virginia.",
  "But would it have been a lawful sale if the gun had been delivered to him on the spot?",
  "Yes. He could not ­­ Mr. Abramski is out of the picture and the uncle goes in, buys the gun, puts down a Pennsylvania address. The dealer gives him the gun and walks out of the store. That ­­ would that be a lawful sale?",
  "Well, I meant my hypothetical. So he doesn't have ­­ he doesn't put it in the Yellow Pages and he doesn't put it on the Internet. He just hangs around in the parking lot at Joe's to accommodate people who ­­ and Joe's is near the border, and he wants to accommodate people who may take it ­­ who wish to employ him as a straw purchaser.",
  "Well, if we agreed with you on the ­­ on the second argument, would the government have to prove that the person to whom the straw purchaser transferred the gun was ineligible or would it be a defense if it was shown that the person was eligible?",
  "Well, before ­­ before you do that, could you explain why there is an issue of proximate causation here? Why ­­ why isn't there clearly proximate cause? Why is it ­­ why does it matter?",
  "Yes. But why ­­ why isn't the issue here a question of factual causation? What losses proximately caused ­­ is proximately caused by the possession of child pornography?",
  "But your answer is in a large category of cases, and this may be ­­ these may be the typical cases, where there's a digital image, and it's out there, and you don't even know that there are a thousand people who've seen it. It's impossible to tell how many people have seen it and certainly impossible to see how many people will see it in the future. It ­­ it exists, and it apparently is impossible to eradicate it. Your answer is that, in those cases, the victim gets nothing. I mean, that's your honest answer. And that may be where the statute points, but I think that's your answer to Justice Breyer's question. The victim gets nothing in those cases because it's impossible to determine what percentage of the harm is attributable to this one defendant's possession of the child pornography.",
  "Well, is it consistent with human psychology? Are psychologists really able to do this? If it's known that this image has been viewed by ­­ even if you could figure out how many people have viewed it, and I think, in the age of the Internet that's impossible, but if you knew that it had been viewed by a thousand people, is a psychologist able to say that her knowledge that it has been viewed by a thousand people causes this much harm? And once she learns that it's now been viewed by a thousand and one people, there's a little bit of additional harm or some increment of additional harm, and we can figure out how much that is. Can a psychologist do that?",
  "Well, let me give you this ­­",
  "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you.",
  "Well, let me give you ­­ Mr. Cassell, let me give you this example. There are pictures like this, and it's known that they are out on the Internet, and so therefore, they are probably always going to be available and who knows how many people are going to view it. And so the first person is caught for possession of some of these pictures and is convicted, and the psychologist testifies that ­­ you know, my client ­­ that the victim in this case knows that these things are out there, and there's an unknown ­­ an unknown quantity of people are going to view it, and my estimate is that the ­­ the treatment she is going to need for this is going to be $5 million. All right. Or 3 million ­­ $3 million, whatever it is. Now, the first person is convicted, so the first person is assessed restitution in the amount of $3 million, right? But then, shortly after that, ten more people are convicted for possessing the same amount. They all pay nothing because the first person paid everything? That's your answer?",
  "In my example, suppose that the first person, who has a restitution order for the full amount, seems unlikely ever to be able to pay that. Does that mean that they ­­ you would impose the same ­­ keep imposing the same judgment on everybody else, so everybody would be hit with $3 million?",
  "Mr. Keisler, do you really mean to say that the only difference between greenhouse gases and the air pollutants that Congress clearly had in mind when it enacted the Clean Air Act is that greenhouse gases don't have a localized effect? Isn't there also a big difference in that the quantity of greenhouse gases that are emitted by sources are much greater than the quantity of these other pollutants and that's why there's this discrepancy between the statutory threshold and the threshold that EPA has ­­",
  "­­ substituted?",
  "Can I ask you this question about ­­ can I ask you this question about EPA's position? Because this is something I don't understand. On the one hand, EPA says that applying the statutory thresholds to greenhouse gases would transform the PSD program into something that would be unrecognizable to the Congress that enacted the program; isn't that right?",
  "On the other hand, EPA says, but that's what we're going to aim to achieve at some point down the road.",
  "Well, then they're never going to get to the statutory thresholds. I thought EPA said, well, we're going to work toward that.",
  "Well, that's ­­ then I don't understand the position. If ­­ if applying the statutory thresholds makes the program unrecognizable, and yet that's what they're going to aim to do down the road, get to ­­ get to the statutory thresholds, will it become more recognizable at that point?",
  "Are greenhouse gases the only air pollutant for which EPA has the authority to change the statutory thresholds?",
  "But could it do ­­ could it do this for another pollutant, something other than any of the greenhouse gases?",
  "Here we have a statutory provision that has very specific numbers, and the agency has said these numbers are absurd. We're going to multiple them by 400. Now, in the entire history of Federal regulation what is the best example you can give us of an agency's doing something like that, where it has taken a statute with numbers and has crossed them out and written in the numbers that it likes?",
  "Is it your argument Congress has acquiesced in that?",
  "I thought there was a very short time lag between EPA's assertion of the authority to regulate the ozone­depleting substances under the PSD program and the enactment of ­­",
  "So was it a full 2 years?",
  "General, I don't want to interrupt your summation, but on the ­­ let me just ask this quick question. On the issue of what happens with a facility that is subject to the PSD program because of the emission of other pollutants, the Petitioners argue that the permitting process would be entirely different for greenhouse gases because it would make no sense to require monitoring of local air conditions and ­­ air conditions. It would make no sense to try to assess the effect of the emission of the greenhouse gases on the area in the region. Could you just give a quick response to that?",
  "Well, Mr. Green, here's one way of looking at this case. Maybe you'll tell me this is the wrong way of looking at it. But let's assume that the bank sells the ­­ the property within a reasonable period of time or as quickly as one could reasonably expect. So one way of looking at this is which party bears the risk that there is going to be a significant deterioration in the real estate market between the time of foreclosure and the time of sale? Now, your answer to that is that the ­­ that the victim should bear that risk? Why should that be? Why would Congress want that?",
  "But real estate isn't completely liquid, and so it takes some time to sell it. So between the time when the foreclosure occurs and the time when the victim is able to sell the property and get money, there ­­ there is a deterioration in the real estate market. Why should the victim bear that risk?",
  "That's a completely formalistic answer. Suppose that the ­­ what the ­­ what the person who perpetrated the fraud returns is a truckload of tomatoes. Very valuable. It's worth exactly the value of the ­­ of the original loan. But very perishable. And by the time the ­­ the tomatoes can be sold, they're all rotten. So they're worth nothing. And you would say, well, they had dominion and control over the truckload of tomatoes. What is the difference?",
  "Well, Ms. Harrington, is it correct this argument that it's all under A? It has been said that the ­­ getting to B is based on this idea. A says if you can't return the property ­­ if you can't return the money, B says return the money. But is that accurate? What A says is if you don't ­­ if it's impossible to return the money, assuming that's the thing at issue, B says return the value.",
  "And under 3664, it is possible for the court to order not A, not restitution of money, but restitution of in­kind services. So there can be ­­ value can be conveyed in a form other than money, so it isn't circular, is it, in the way that's been suggested?",
  "Is there any reason why the ­­ why the sentencing judge, where there's an ­­ an allegation and maybe a ­­ a suggestion that there was unreasonable delay or something unreasonable was going on require the Government to provide some substantiation for ­­ for what happened?",
  "Well, you can make ­­ you can make that argument with respect to every legal issue that's raised on appeal. Well, if you have to decide whether the lower court was right, that's a lot of work. But if all you have to decide is whether the lower court abused its discretion in deciding if the law means what the lower court said it means, that's a lot less work.",
  "So that argument is a strange argument, unless there's something really special about the attorneys' fees context. And I guess that's your argument, there's something really special. But why should it? I mean, you've got a lot of money involved. Why should we say, this is collateral litigation, even though it involves millions of dollars more than the claim in many other types of cases?",
  "It can clarify what the law is. What's the difference between that situation and, let's say, deciding an issue of qualified immunity in a civil rights case or applying the ­­ applying AEDPA in a habeas case? The court can say this is what the law is, and then after that, as the second step, determine whether a particular interpretation of the law was reasonable. You could do the same thing here.",
  "Well, I'm just wondering, if you put together your two arguments about what the standard should be and what the standard of review should be, whether there really is going to be any meaningful review of what district courts do in this situation. Maybe you could just describe for me what an appellate decision would look like, saying that applying the totality of the circumstances, the district court abused its discretion in awarding or not awarding fees. What would an appellate court say.",
  "You have several objections, I take it, to what the Federal Circuit has said. One is that you think objectively baseless is too low, correct?",
  "You also don't think bad faith is necessary.",
  "And do you also believe that litigation misconduct taken in conjunction with a case that is, let's say, of little merit, but perhaps not as low as the standard that you have, that you're suggesting, would justify an award of fees?",
  "Well, now I'm a ­­ say I'm a district judge someplace and I rarely get a patent case. How am I supposed to determine whether the case is exceptional if the standard is take everything into account, litigation misconduct, the strength of the case, any indication of bad faith, and decide whether it's exceptional? Exceptional compared to what? I have very little basis for comparison. How do I do that?",
  "Compared to what? Compared to the types of cases that the district court hears on a more regular basis?",
  "Or compared to patent cases?",
  "See, this is what I find somewhat troubling about your \"take everything into account\" standard. Most district court judges do not see a lot of patent cases, and when they see one, it's very unusual. So you've got these patent attorneys showing up in court. They are different from other attorneys.",
  "Sometimes they ­­ particularly if it's a very technical case, they speak a different language. They do things differently. The district judge is struggling to figure out how to handle the case. And then the ­­ one ­­ one party wins, the other party loses, and the party that wins says, this was an exceptional case and you should award fees in my favor under 285. And the district judge says: How can I tell whether this is exceptional? If I had had ­­ if I had 25 patent cases, I could make some comparisons. But I don't have a basis for doing that. Now, the Federal Circuit has a basis for doing it.",
  "Is that really true? There's nearly 700 district judges in the country. If ­­ if we had a statistic about the average number of patent cases that a district judge hears and receives on, let's say, a 5­year period, what would it be?",
  "What is the difference between ­­ you say the correct phrase is objectively unreasonable?",
  "That's different from objectively baseless. That's a little higher than objectively baseless?",
  "And that's higher than the Rule 11 standard?",
  "May I come back to a question? May I come back to something similar to what Justice Sotomayor started out with. In your view, does the Constitution establish a State to establish any hard cutoff? Let's say 76. Can it do that?",
  "All right. If it can do that ­­ oh, I'm sorry.",
  "Which party has the burden of persuasion on the issue of IQ and what is the standard?",
  "I mean, what ­­ what does the Eighth Amendment require? Does the Eighth Amendment permit a State to assign to the defendant the burden of persuasion on ­­ on IQ, IQ above 75? Can they assign that burden of ­­ above 70? Can they assign that to the defendant, and if they can what is the standard of proof that the defendant has to meet?",
  "Why can't the State ­­ you told me that the State can establish a hard cutoff. And you told me that a State can assign the burden to the defendant. Now, in the case of someone who scores 75, is it not the case that there's roughly ­­ there's no more than a 2.5 percent chance that that person's real IQ is 70. So how does that square with any burden of proof that might be ­­ any standard of proof that might be assigned on that ­­ on that point? That's what I don't understand about your argument.",
  "No, I understand.",
  "But I'm talking about the general issue. Just hypothetically ­­",
  "I understand that argument. But that doesn't seem to me consistent with your point that a State can establish a hard cutoff. 76, that's the end. You get a 76 on an IQ test, that's the end of the inquiry. The person does not ­­ does not ­­ does not qualify under Atkins.",
  "On Justice Breyer's last point, before your ­­ your time expires, because I do think this is important. Is there not another way of proving reliability? Suppose ­­ what about multiple tests? Suppose someone is given 25 Wechsler tests and 24 times the person scores 76 and one time the person scores 72. What would you deal with ­­ how would you deal with that in a State that has a hard cutoff?",
  "That's not consistent with my understanding of it, but I don't claim that I have a deep understanding of it. But what ­­ what would be your answer to my hypothetical? Where there are multiple scores that are above the hard cutoff but one that's below ­­ and I will ask the State the opposite question ­­ what would you do there?",
  "Well, what does the Eighth Amendment require, in your view?",
  "Is it the case that those who use IQ tests always require a 95 percent confidence level and always must require a 95 percent confidence level? Let's suppose a school on the other end of the IQ scale wants to identify gifted children and they say a child is gifted if the child has an IQ of 130 or above. So they say if you have an obtained score of 130, you're in. You're in the gifted child program, even though there is the same percentage that would be ­­ would be the case with respect to someone with an IQ of 70, that really the person is below 130. Would there be something wrong with their doing that?",
  "Do they ­­ are there places that do that?",
  "Isn't it the case that the court has discretion to reach the second prong if it wants to? The court could say it wasn't reasonably ­­ it wasn't clearly established, but it was an unreasonable seizure. It could do that, couldn't it?",
  "No, that wasn't my question. The ­­ the court has to, ruling on qualified immunity, it has to decide whether there ­­ whether the law was reasonably ­­ the rule that's being applied was reasonably ­­ was clearly established. But having done that, even if it says it was and, therefore, the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity, doesn't Pearson say that the court has discretion about whether to go on to the second prong?",
  "Well, what do you think the officers should have done at that point? What should a reasonable officer do when there has been a high­speed chase and the car spins out of control? And forget about whether there was any attempt to ram anybody or to hit to anybody with the car. The car spins out of control. It's eventually surrounded by officers with guns pointed at the driver demanding that he get out, that he put up his hands, stop driving. They are pounding on the ­­ on the windows of the car. And the driver then begins to drive away. What does a ­­ what do reasonable officers do? Maybe they ­­ what they should do is to continue the chase indefinitely. I don't know. What do you think?",
  "But I thought the reasonableness of a Fourth Amendment seizure was an objective question, not a subjective question.",
  "So why does it matter what reason he subjectively had?",
  "Well, I know. But if he ­­ he says I did it because I thought he was going to run me over. But an objective officer looking at the situation would say that the use of deadly force is necessary here to prevent this chase from continuing on the interstate and endangering other motorists and their passengers. So if that were the situation, wouldn't that mean that was a reasonable seizure?",
  "Initiated by the fact by the officer who used the force had a different motive?",
  "What if the situation is that the officer has ­­ has this choice. After a high­speed chase, after attempting to persuade the driver to get out of the car, the officer has one ­­ has these choices: Allow the chase to continue or use lethal force.",
  "Your answer is they have to let the ­­ they ­­ they can use lethal force? They have to allow the chase to continue? What? Which?",
  "As to the number of shots, even with all the shots that were fired, Mr. Rickard still was able to drive away for a short distance.",

  "But, Mr. Boies, to say that false representation affects the market price is quite different from saying that it affects the market price almost immediately, and it's hard to see how the Basic theory can be sustained unless it does affect the market price almost immediately in what Basic described as an efficient market. Isn't that true? Why should someone who purchased the stock on the day, shortly, you know, an hour or two after the disclosure, be entitled to recovery if in that particular market there is some lag time in incorporating the new information?",
  "I didn't understand what you just said. Are you saying there are not categories of investors who might say to themselves, You know what? There is a possibility that the price of this stock on this particular day might be artificially inflated by some statement that was made in the past that isn't true, but I'm going to buy it anyway because I still think it's either ­­ it's undervalued or because there are some other statistics regarding the market that tell me that this price is going to go up. You tell me that there are ­­ there are not large categories of investors who think that way?",

  "And why did it tell ­­",
  "Why did it say that? It changed the definition at the time when RLUIPA was adopted, did it not, to eliminate the reference to the First Amendment; isn't that right?",
  "Well, it says free exercise. And didn't it also adopt a provision in RLUIPA saying that ­­ that the exercise of religion was to be interpreted in the broadest possible way?",
  "No. Didn't it say ­­ didn't it say the term \"religious exercise\" includes any exercise ­­",

  "Isn't it true with respect to the grandfathered plans that the regulations required immediate compliance with certain requirements, but not with preventive care requirements; isn't that right? Let me read you what HHS said in the regulation: \"With certain particularly significant protections, particularly significant protections, Congress required grandfathered health plans to comply with a subset of the Affordable Care Act's health reform provisions. On the other hand, grandfathered health plans are not required to comply with certain other requirements of the Affordable Care Act; for example, the requirement that preventive health services be covered without any cost sharing.\" So isn't HHS saying there, quite specifically, these, in our view, are not within this subset of particularly significant requirements as to which there must be immediate compliance?",
  "Well, we can ask Mr. Clement what his position is on this. But you say they have already asserted that it would be inconsistent with RFRA as they understand it to provide for a for­profit corporation, like the ones involved here, the sort of accommodation that HHS has extended to so­called religious nonprofits, perhaps with the modification that was included in our stay order in the Little Sisters case. Have they taken a position on that?",
  "I thought that ­­ I was taken by your answer.

  "What about the implications of saying that no for­profit corporation can raise any sort of free exercise claim at all and nobody associated with the for­profit corporation can raise any sort of free exercise claim at all?

  "How would that ­­ how would that work? Would the jury have to be instructed about the U.C.C. and be asked to determine whether the bank or Target, in this case, would be liable for the funds if the bank had honored a forged check?",
  "Why would it not matter?",
  "No, under your view. Under your view that there has to be an intent to defraud a bank. Why would it not matter from ­­ who would ultimately be liable for the ­­ for the money ­­ for the amount of the check?",
  "I think you have a ­­ you have a credible textual argument, but you run into the problem that your interpretation makes Section ­­ Subsection 1 surplusage. How do you get around that?",
  "Well, under the alternative, there is certainly overlap, but (2) reaches a much broader category or it reaches a broader category. So it's not useless.",
  "Representation doesn't have to be made to the bank under (2). (2) covers those instances where the representation is made to somebody else. (1) would be limited to those, perhaps, in which the representation is made to the bank. But under your interpretation where (2) requires that the representation be made to the bank, there is no point in having two subsections. You might as well just have one.",
  "Well, could I ask you this question? Suppose the defendant testifies and suppose the jury believes the defendant. The defendant testifies as follows: I never intended to defraud the bank.

I stole them from his mailbox. I crossed out his name and I wrote in the name of the retail establishment and I knew these cashiers were so careless that they would honor the check. However, I never thought any bank would do that. So I didn't intend to defraud the bank. I intended to defraud the retail establishment. Now, under your theory that ­­ that if the jury believed that, the person would not be guilty of the offense.",
  "Usually there won't be evidence, direct evidence of the defendant's intent. So the defendant's intent will be inferred from objective evidence ­­ will be inferred from other evidence, and then you will get into the question of whether the retailer who initially accepts the check or the bank is ultimately going to be liable for the amount of that check. If you're ­­ if you're in a situation in which the ­­ the retailer is going to be liable, that ­­ maybe that supports the ­­ the inference that the defendant never intended to defraud the bank. If you're in a situation where the bank is going to be liable, it supports the inference that the defendant intended to defraud the bank. So won't you get into this somewhat complicated UCC question about who is ultimately going to be liable for the amount? I think that's a problem with your argument, but maybe there's an answer to it.",
  "Along those lines, if we were to agree that under sub (2) it was necessary to show an intent to defraud the bank, what would the government have to prove in an altered check case?",
  "Or what would you have had to prove under sub (1) if this case could properly be prosecuted under sub (1)?",
  "What I'm getting at is would this require delving into the defendant's knowledge of the legal relationship between the merchant here and the bank?",
  "Doesn't the answer depend on from whom ­­ for whom the money, either owned or under ­­ in the custody of the bank has to be obtained? If it ­­ if it doesn't have to be obtained by the defendant, then it wouldn't seem to me that there would be much of a question.

  "Right. The ultimate ­­",

  "Where do you get it the from the text? I understand the argument. It's a ­­ it's a very credible argument. It doesn't say to whom the representations have to be made. So you put in to the bank.",

  "In an ESOP ­­ in an ESOP, can the fiduciary take into account the interests of the participants as employees as opposed to their interests as investors?

They want the company to stay afloat. Can that properly be taken into account, or is that outside of the bounds?",
  "No, I'm not saying only as employees, but I'm saying can you take that into account at all?

It might not be in the best interests ­­ if the ­­ if the ­­ if these participants were simply investors, it might be in their best interests to stop buying the stock. But if taking that step would have the consequences that I mentioned, it might be very much not in their best interests as employees.",
  "What do they have to do then? You said they can't sell the stock based on that information. What are they supposed to do? Or is it your argument that they just never ­­ you never should have insiders serving as trustees; you always have to have an outside running these ESOPs?",
  "So you're basically saying that if it's not flatly prohibited, it is very unwise. It generally shouldn't happen. You're putting yourself in an impossible position if you are an insider and you're going to serve as the trustee of an ESOP.",
  "Do you think the trustee has a duty to acquire inside information? The trustees say, I don't want to know insider information. I'm going to put myself in exactly the position of an outside trustee, so I'm going to take into account only public information, I'm not going to do an investigation.",
  "What's the answer to my question? Assuming that ­­",
  "­­ permissible for an insider to be in this position, can the insider behave like an outsider?",
  "But you say they should sell based on the inside information?",
  "Well, let me give you – I’ll give you this example. It's helpful to have something concrete here and not just general statements of ­­ of ­­ about fiduciary duty. Let's say that the trustee receives inside information that someone has alleged that corporate office ­­ a particular corporate officer has engaged in illegal conduct. And if it turns out that that conduct actually took place, that ­­ that information ­­ that will cause damage to the company. But it's ­­ it's ­­ it hasn't been proven.

And so the FDA says, if you put even an eyedropper full of that in your blend, you have to put that prominently on the bottle so that these people will not inadvertently get an allergic reaction. Could you have a Lanham Act claim then?",
  "Well, what I'm saying is suppose it's the case that for 99.999 percent of the population, the more pomegranate juice, the better, you just can't drink enough of it. The more you drink, the healthier you are. But for this tiny percentage of the population, it could produce an allergic reaction. And so the FDA says, you've got to put that on there even if there is just a tincture of pomegranate juice. Could you have a Lanham Act claim on the ground for the vast majority of your potential customers, they are going to be misled, because they want pomegranate juice and they are buying this stuff that just has a little bit of it in it?",
  "What public health benefit is served by this regulation? This is what puzzles me about it.",
  "You don't think there are a lot of people who buy pomegranate juice because of ­­ they think it has health benefits and they would be very surprised to find when they bring home this bottle that's got a big picture of a pomegranate on it and it says \"pomegranate\" on it, that it is ­­ what is it, less than one­half of one percent pomegranate juice?",

However, we anticipate that there's going to be a Tax Court proceeding and we want to get discovery for the Tax Court proceeding. Is that a proper purpose?",
  "But that doesn't ­­ that's doesn't really seem very helpful because there are inferences and there are inferences. There are weak inferences and there are strong inferences. I don't think it's very helpful to a district judge for us to send this back and say: Figure out whether there is an inference here of ­­ of some unspecified strength. Take the retaliation issue. You have ­­ let's say these are the facts. The ­­ the IRS asks for a further extension of the statute of limitations, the taxpayer says no: I'm not going to agree to any further extensions, and then a half an hour later the summons are served. So you have one thing happening shortly after another. That gives rise to an inference of retaliation. Maybe it's a very weak inference; maybe it's a stronger inference. Do you see what I'm saying? We have to specify something other than it gives rise to an inference of some unspecified strength.",

  "It sounds like you really are advocating the \"insolubly ambiguous\" standard, that's what you're saying. Unless you have to throw up your hands at the end and you say, we can't figure out which one this means, there is no correct interpretation, unless that's the case, then the patent is valid.",
  "Well, was the Federal Circuit wrong when it said the test should be insolubly ambiguous? Was that wrong or not?",

  "Well, let me make sure I understand what you're saying. Two employees know that there is someone who has a no shot ­­ no­show job where they work. One of them writes a letter to the editor and says: John Doe has a no­show job. One of them testifies pursuant to subpoena in a criminal trial: John Doe has a no­show job. Is ­­ is it your view that Pickering does not apply in either of those situations, or it applies in ­­ in the latter but not in the former?",
  "Neither one.",
  "Well, Mr. Fisher, before we do that, have you been accurate in what you said about Robinson and about the Court's cases? In Weeks, which was quoted in Robinson, the Court said: \"The right, always recognized under English and American law, to search the person of the accused when legally arrested to discover and seize the fruits or evidences of crime.\" Is that historically inaccurate? Do you want us to repudiate that?",
  "Well, smartphones ­­ smartphones do present difficult problems. But let me ask you this: Suppose your client were an old­school guy and he didn't have ­­ he didn't have a cell phone. He had a billfold and he had photos that were important to him in the billfold. He had that at the time of arrest. Do you dispute the proposition that the police could examine the photos in his billfold and use those as evidence against him?",
  "Yes. What is the difference between looking at hardcopy photos in a billfold and looking at photos that are saved in the memory of a cell phone?",
  "Well, how does that apply ­­ how does that apply to these hardcopy photos in the billfold? They don't present a threat to anybody. And I don't see that there's much of a difference between ­­ the government argues there's a greater risk of the destruction of digital evidence in a cell phone than ­­ than there is in the photos. So I don't quite understand how ­­ how that applies to that situation.",
  "But do you think in this case we have to decide whether all the information that may be available in a smartphone can be examined by the police when the owner of the phone is arrested or can we just focus on the particular evidence that was admitted in your client's trial?",
  "What if the phone in this case was an old­fashioned flip­phone? So it had the capacity to take pictures, but a much more limited memory. Would it ­­ would it be a different case?",
  "What if the person had on his person a compact disk with photos saved on that?",
  "You could amend your answer and it's ­­ the answers are for you, not for us. But you could amend your answer to say not just anything that somebody could have had.

But you could say something that has a realistic analogue in the predigital era. We have a similar ­­ a problem here that's similar to the problem in the Jones GPS case. You have a rule of law that was established in the predigital era and now you have to apply it in the digital era or you're asked to apply it in the digital era where the technology changes a lot of things. But if there is a close analogue in the digital era to something that would have been allowed in the predigital era, that may be a different story.",

  "The cell phone company won't have information about the length of the call?",
  "Well, what are we dealing with here? I know everybody wants to talk about global issues, but what ­­ what are the ­­ what information are we talking about in this case? We have my home, which you said is in plain view, my house, and then you have the call log. What else do we have?",
  "Well, if the call log, the numbers called, is not covered by a reasonable expectation of privacy, and my house is not covered by a reasonable expectation of privacy, then where is the search?",
  "And you couldn’t do that and look for a razor blade?",
  "Flip open the old style flip­phone to see if there's something inside?",
  "Well, they saw that the number ­­ they saw the phone rang at a particular time, and then if you look at the call log, you can see what call came in at that particular time. And then you know where the call came from that registered as my house.",
  "Why ­­ why is that so and maybe I don't understand the facts. If ­­ if a phone rang right now and you look at the call log and you see what call came in at 12:13, and you know that the call came from my house, and you see the number from ­­ of the call that came in at 12:13, wouldn't you know that that was the number from my house?",
  "In determining whether the examination of information on a cell phone is ­­ constitutes a search, what do you think we ­­ we are doing? Are we trying to ­­ to ­­ are we answering an empirical question, what is the reasonable expectation of privacy of a ­­ of a person in 2014 who has a cell phone in his or her ­­ on his or her person? Or are we legislating what we think is a good privacy rule?",
  "All right. Well, a lot of that ­­ part of that is the person must act ­­ people must actually have that expectation. That must be the expectation of people at large in 2014, that they think that everything that's on their cell phones is private, or they think some of the information on the cell phones is private, or they think nothing on the cell phone is private. Where do you think we should look to answer that question about what people in 2014 think about that question?",
  "But why is that so? Cell phones are different. I'm not going to say for a ­­ suggest for a second that there are like things that existed in the pre­digital area. But in the pre­digital era, presumably people didn't have a reasonable expectation of privacy in papers, letters, things like that that they had, of photos in a billfold, numbers, addresses, things that they might ­­ they might be carrying on their persons.",
  "So how do we determine what the ­­ what the new expectation of privacy is now?",
  "Then why was it not a search when ­­ when you ­­ you searched the pocket of somebody who was arrested and you found the address of someplace?",
  "All right. What was the ­­ why ­­ how do we determine whether something has ­­ somebody has a reasonable expectation of privacy in any category of information that is contained on a cell phone?",
  "Yeah, and that's the ­­",
  "No. I understand that. But that ­­ that's the question that I was asking before. Is it a reasonable search or seizure? All right. So you have to balance the privacy interest versus the law enforcement interest. And how do ­­ how do we find out what the privacy interests are ­­ what the privacy expectations are, which go into that balance with respect to cell phones in 2014?",
  "Does it matter? You think it doesn't matter? Maybe people feel very strongly every single thing that's in the cell phone is ­­ is private, or maybe they don't. Maybe they think some things are private; some things are not private.",

And the first one it lists is the Batson claim. Does that suggest maybe the court had two reasons for what it did? It's barred by res judicata, and it would fail even if it were not.",
  "Well, I'd like the ­­ I'd like counsel's answer ­­",
  "Do you think that's still clear after our decision in Johnson?",
  "But what you're relying is ­­ you're relying on language that is similar to, maybe, and ­­ and maybe different in an ­­ in an important respect; but nevertheless bears some similarity to the residual clause in the ­­ in the armed criminal ­­ Armed Career Criminal Act, does it not?",
  "May I ask you about the statutory language that seems to me to present the greatest problem for your position. Maybe it's not fatal, but what I'm referring to is the provision that says the term applies ­­ so we're looking at whether the ­­ the State offense here is described in the Federal arson statute. And then there's language that says, the term applies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of Federal or State law. What do you make of that? It can be argued that what that means is that, when you have a Federal offense with a jurisdictional provision, you disregard the jurisdictional provision because you're never going to find that in a State provision.",
  "But suppose ­­",
  "Go ahead.",
  "Take two ­­ two defendants. One is convicted of the Federal offense of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, where you have to prove a connection between the firearm and interstate commerce.

And under your argument, the first would be included and the second would not.",
  "Why ­­ why is that?",
  "Thank you. Following up on that,though: But why isn't that true here, in light of the ­­ the Court's decision in Jones?",
  "Didn't the Court's ­­ didn't the Court's decision in Jones interpret the reference to interstate commerce to be something more than just a jurisdictional hook, but rather a substantive requirement that limited the scope of this particular statute to more severe instances of ­­ of examples of the crime?",

  "Well, there's another possible explanation for that, because the last item in the list itself involves a great many ­­ itself involves a list. So the second \"or\" could be a substitute for a semicolon. But let me ask you another question about the language that you just read. As I understand your argument, this provision would apply to sexual abuse involving a minor and also abusive sexual conduct involving a minor. Is there any difference between those two things?",
  "So why did Congress put them both in?",
  "Well, there's something that jumps out. It's a strange list, aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse. Sexual abuse would include aggravated sexual abuse. So that seems to be ­­ the reference to aggravated sexual abuse seems to be redundant. And abusive sexual conduct, if understood in ordinary ­­ in the terms of ordinary language, does seem to duplicate sexual abuse. But there's an explanation that jumps out, and that is that this ­­ almost this precise terminology appears in Sections 2241, 2242, and 2243. And in those provisions, all those terms are defined so that they mean something different. So it seems to jump out at the reader that that's what Congress was doing in this list. Why is ­­ what is wrong with that?",
  "Well, it could have done it more clearly. That's certainly the answer to this whole case. They could have handled this issue a lot more clearly. But that is the ­­ the idea that they were picking up the definitions in the Federal provisions is one explanation for this rather strange ­­ this list. The other makes the list terribly redundant, and I haven't heard your explanation as to why they would do that. Why include both sexual abuse and aggravated sexual abuse? Why include sexual abuse and abusive sexual conduct?",
  "But your ­­ your argument is that it is just a coincidence that Congress came up with this list of three terms that are redundant and that just so happen to be almost exactly the same three terms in the same order that appear in the Federal provisions.",
  "But they used ­­ they used ­­",
  "When they use \"sexual abuse\" and \"sexually abusive conduct,\" they were not ­­ they ­­ they had in mind the Federal provisions, but they didn't want those terms in this provision to mean the same thing as they mean in the Federal provision, even though, according to you, there is no generally accepted understanding of the difference between sexual abuse and abusive sexual conduct.",
  "Sexual abuse is defined, and abusive sexual contact is defined, are they not?",
  "Why do you resist ­­ why ­­ why do you resist the argument that what Congress was doing was picking up basically the definitions of the Federal offenses that are worded almost identically? If that's what they are doing, then it's understandable what is meant by all three terms. If that's not what they were doing, it's a strange coincidence. And not only is there redundancy, but there's ambiguity about what is meant by sexual abuse as opposed to abusive sexual conduct, and why they had to put in aggravated sexual abuse in addition to sexual abuse.",
  "Yes, they could have done it more clearly, of course. The ­­ the statute is ­­ is poorly drafted. You know, we give them a \"D\" for their drafting of this statute. But what is the difference between sexual abuse and abusive sexual conduct? Putting aside the definitions of those ­­ of those terms or similar terms in Chapter 109.",
  "So why did they put ­­ why did they do that?",
  "Just catchy phrases that came to their mind?",

  "Let's take a ­­ an offense as to which there isn't much ambiguity: Rape. All right? Under the ­­ the ordinary meaning, why would rape in a Federal enclave qualify; rape a few yards away, perhaps, in State territory, not ­­ not qualify?",
  "What if it's perfectly clear that the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment? Let's say the State legislature goes back to its pre Reynolds v. Sims method of constituting the State legislature. Does that have to be referred to a three­judge court?",
  "How do you square that ­­",
  "Okay. How do you square that with the statutory language?",
  "How do you think the ­­ the Goosby Rule applies to political gerrymandering claims in general? This Court has never seen one that it thought was justiciable. Do you think there are any that ­­ but assuming that the possibility that there might be one is enough to take the case to the three­judge court? And if that's so, are there any that would not go to a three­judge court?",
  "But so long as it favors who ­­ the party that controlled the legislature when the plan was drawn up, which is almost always the case, couldn't a political gerrymandering claim be made that that's why it was done?",
  "Well, to go back to your ­­",
  "On the issue of political sensitivity, if it goes to a single judge, you will have a decision by a judge who has presumably been selected by the spin of the wheel, or by ­­ at random, and then you'll have an appeal to a court of appeals panel that is presumably chosen at random. Whereas if it goes to a three­judge court, there will be a decision, and it may involve some very sensitive findings of fact by a panel that is hand­picked by the chief judge, who is in a position to appoint himself or herself to the three­judge court and select a third district judge who the chief judge believes is likely to agree with or defer to the chief judge. So I don't see how that ­­ how that creates an insulation against the appearance of political favoritism.",
  "This may be where the law leads us. But in your brief, you try to make the argument that this is equitable in the ordinary sense of the word. And I don't understand that. What sense does all of this make?",
  "Probably what ­­",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Is there any way at this point to determine which employees were actually injured and which ones were not? Because I ­­ I gathered because the jury rejected the full verdict that was requested by the plaintiffs, they did not accept Dr. Mericle's testimony regarding the amount of time needed to don and doff for employees in various categories. And without knowing that, I don't see how you can at this point ­­ I'll ­­ I'll ask Mr. Frederick the same question ­­ how you can separate the employees who were injured from the employees who were not injured.",
  "Well, there is no question the money can be divided up. The question is whether it can be divided up between those who were actually injured and those who were not actually injured. So suppose you have ­­ if you have three employees, one worked ­­ one was ­­ one was given credit for working 39 hours a week, one was given credit for working 38 hours a week, one was given credit for working 37 hours a week. Without knowing how much additional time the ­­ each employee is entitled to, you can't tell which one of those, which, if any, of them was injured, and you can't tell how much additional time the employees were entitled to without knowing what the jury did with Dr. Mericle's statistics. So that's why I ­­ I don't see how this can be done in other than a very slap­dash fashion.",
  "Could I just ask you to clarify something before your time runs out, because it ­­ it's unclear to me from what you've said in your argument. Why did Dr. Mericle come up with one figure for employees on the processing floor and another figure for employees on the slaughter floor if, as I understand you to have said this morning, all of the employees basically do both of those tasks and spend an equal amount of time on them, so they can all be considered together?",
  "Well, that was the impression I got from what you said.",
  "What do you think an employer ­­",
  "What do you think an employer should do about recordkeeping when the employer believes that certain activities need not be counted under the FLSA? So is the employer ­­ it may be that the employer is stuck with the choice that it makes, the legal judgment it makes. But is it supposed to keep two sets of ­­ of records so the amount of time that it thinks the employee is entitled to compensation for, and then this additional amount of time, that it might be argued that the employee is entitled to compensation for?",
  "Well, let me go back to Justice ­­ Justice Kagan's question and ask it in ­­ in a different way. So you ­­ we have two brothers and ­­ twin brothers, and they rob a bank. They get $10,000. They split it up, $5,000 each. And on that very same day, it happens to be their birthday, and their rich uncle comes and gives each of them $5,000 as a birthday present. So they go out to party, and one of them ­­ and they both spend $5,000 partying. One of them spends the money from the bank robbery. The other one spends the money that was given to them by their rich uncle. And your position is that the one who spent the money from the so­called \"tainted assets,\" the money from the bank robbery, is entitled to use the remaining $5,000 to hire an attorney, but the other one is out of luck?",
  "What sense does that make?",
  "The problem with this argument is that as a matter of economics and ­­ and common sense, money is fungible. To say if the ­­ if the so­called tainted money has been spent, and what's left is the untainted money, it doesn't make a difference which ­­ you know, which pot has been spent and which pot hasn't been spent.",
  "Well, yes, but then there's ­­ that's all sorts of complicated rules in those areas. I mean, let's ­­ suppose you have ­­ and none of that necessarily applies here. Suppose you have the situation where what's at stake is money that's going to be used for restitution, all right? So at the beginning of the case, the question is whether the defendant can spend that money to hire the attorney of the defendant's choice, which is certainly a very powerful interest, or whether that money, at the end of the case if there is a conviction, is going to go to the victims. So how do you ­­ how do you try to accommodate those two interests?",
  "So your answer is that the defendant's right to hire counsel of choice takes precedence over the rights of the victims, and you would say that no matter how strong the proof is?",
  "Until there's ­­ until there is a verdict?",
  "I don't ­­ go ahead and finish.",
  "I'm ­­ I'm troubled by this statute. I ­­ I can't understand the difference between (a) and (B).

This would apply regardless of whether there's any Sixth Amendment issue in the case. But, having said that ­­ Mr. Srebnick can address those in rebuttal if he wishes to, but having said that, if (B) does not refer to a temporary form of relief, then ­­ which I understand to be your argument ­­ then I don't understand what (a) contributes.",
  "I don't want to use up your rebuttal time, but I do want to ask you two quick questions about the statute. First is: Did you raise anything about this in your cert petition? And the second is: Is there a way to limit this to the Sixth Amendment context?",
  "You didn't say anything about constitutional avoidance in your cert position, did you?",
  "Could I ask you ­­ I'm sorry.",
  "You wanted to finish that.",
  "It doesn't seem clear to me that these two theories are actually separate. They ­­ they ­­ when Congress enacts a criminal statute, it often adds a lot of synonyms.

And I don't really see a difference between making unauthorized access and exceeding authorized access. Let's take the first, making unauthorized access. Let's say somebody has access to some ­­ an employee here in the building has access to ­­ lawful access, proper access to some records. If that employee at night sneaks into some other place in the building and starts looking through files, that person is making unauthorized access. And in the other situation, exceeding authorized access, let's say a person doesn't have any ­­ any access to any files in the court, but sneaks in and looks at those files. That person had zero authorized access and, therefore, exceeded authorized access. I just think these are ­­ it seems to me, reading them, they're two ways of saying the same thing.

  "Suppose that there's a ­­ that there's a two­count indictment and there's plenty of evidence to convict on Count I and zero evidence, not one scintilla of evidence, on Count II, and the jury convicts on both counts; so the ­­ defendant is entitled to a judgment of acquittal on Count II. But you seem to be saying in that situation, the court would say, this is a crazy jury. This is an irrational jury because their verdict on Count II is totally ridiculous; and therefore, the defendant is entitled to judgment of acquittal on Count I as well, despite the fact that there's plenty of evidence on Count I. Is that what you're saying?",
  "Well, what's different ­­ what's the difference between that and the argument you just made?",
  "That ­­ that would be a revolutionary holding.",
  "But, now, I don't see a difference, other than a purely formal difference, between that situation and what you're ­­ what you're arguing.",
  "Well, why was the instruction erroneous? You concede that these two methods of violating the statute are discrete? They're not just different ways of describing the same thing?",
  "Well, suppose you had an indictment charging someone with exceeding authorized access and there was a factual dispute about, let's say, the date on which the employee's employment ended, so therefore, the date on which any authorized access that the employee had to records of the employer ended, you would say that, if you did not succeed in proving beyond a reasonable doubt that, as of the date when the access was obtained, the employee had ceased to be employed, that that employee would be entitled to a judgment of acquittal? That seems rather odd.",
  "Well, couldn't there not be ­­",
  "Why shouldn't the rule in this context be the same as the rule for timely filing a Federal habeas petition?",
  "You think that the State's interest in the habeas context in finality and comity is stronger than the defendant's interest in a direct criminal appeal in requiring that the charge be filed on time where what's at stake is ­­ is a criminal conviction?",
  "But ­­ but just take a situation where, under the habeas rule, it would be proper for the ­­ the district court to raise the statute­of­limitations defense on its own motion. Why would that not fit within the plain­error rule?",
  "Suppose the court of appeals in ­­ in a direct appeal sees that the statute of limitations for a particular offense is six years and the indictment was filed 25 years after the event. Can the court of appeals say to the government, look at this. It looks like it's too late. Do you have any explanation for this? And the government says, well, no, doesn't ­­ we can't think of anything. Do you have to wait until habeas to correct that?",
  "May I follow up on Justice Kagan's question? You were discussing the possibility of deciding this case based on the particular language of the regulation that applies here, but your question presented is phrased much more broadly. You say under Federal employment discrimination law, so I took that to mean that the rule that you're advocating would be the same for public and private sector employment.",
  "But there is ­­ this matter alleged to be discriminatory applies only to Federal employment.",
  "Isn't it true that outside of the area of constructive discharge ­­ and maybe constructive discharge is different, and I think that's really the thrust of your argument. But outside of that situation there must be an act of intentional discrimination within the limitations period.",
  "Yeah, but you're arguing that there's ­­ because there's this imputation, it's different for constructive discharge.",
  "But my ­­ my question is outside of that context, under Evans and Ricks and Morgan and Ledbetter, there must be an act of intentional discrimination within the limitations period.",

  "We're interpreting the language ­­ it's not even a statute. It's a regulation. It's your regulation.",
  "Why don't you just amend it to make it clear? You think this is a sensible rule, it is a very clear rule. And it's probably a sensible rule when you've got a 45­day period. Why don't you just change the regulation? Why ­­",

And then on the day when he quits there is another email that says, Hallelujah, we've achieved our objective, he's retired. Now when would it run in that situation?",
  "Let me clarify it. So nothing more is done. There are all these acts up to a certain point, and then 45 days, 50 days pass and the employee resigns, but the employer has all along had the intention of forcing the resignation. So on the date of the resignation the employer intends to cause a discharge for discriminatory reason.",

  "All right. So you seem to be saying that the category of claims they did not want adjudicated in State court are only these: Those in which the plaintiff is asking for the enforcement of a Federal duty, and there is no comparable State duty at that time, and the State court is unwilling to recognize a comparable State duty in the context of that litigation. So these are essentially cases in which the State is basically hostile to the Federal duty. And those are the only cases that Congress did not want to have adjudicated in State court.

  "Well, what if the only way that you ­­ that a State could obtain preclearance when Section 5 was still in force was to under­populate some districts? Would that be permissible?",
  "Just as you might have a situation where the only way in which you could respect municipal lines or county lines was to under­populate some districts to some degree.",
  "Well, the district court found ­­ and this is on 79a of the Appendix to the Jurisdictional Statement ­­ \"partisanship played some role.\" So do you want us to interpret that to mean that if there was no partisanship, everything would have come out exactly the same way? It had no affect whatsoever on the districting?",
  "Well, that's a ­­ that's a red herring. We don't need to discuss the issue of parity. If you have a system of proportional representation and you get 55 percent of the vote, you'll get 55 percent of the ­­ of the representatives.

  "This is what ­­ this is what interests me about the case. If we assume, as the district court did, that partisanship is not a legitimate consideration, and it's not, like, respecting county lines, and if we interpret the district court's opinion as finding that partisanship was part of the reason for the plan that was adopted, then is the test, the Mt. Healthy test ­­ which in my understanding is what we normally apply in a constitutional mixed motive situation. So that if an illegitimate, unconstitutional consideration is one of the reasons, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that things would have come out the same way, even if that factor had not been in the case, or is it what the court said in Bush v. Vera and a few other cases, that in this particular context, that's not the test? The test is whether the illegitimate factor there, race, was the predominant consideration.",
  "It seems to me it ­­ it turns on the choice between the two.",
  "Is that a wrong?",
  "Well, what if there were? What if there were a case where the ­­ the commissioner or whoever was responsible for producing the plan produced ­­ chose between two plans.

  "No, it's not this case, but it ­­",
  "Well, let ­­ let's assume that the ­­ the opinion of the district court found that partisanship was a consideration. So are you saying that that finding can't be sustained because it wasn't based on sufficient evidence brought forward by the plaintiffs?",
  "Well, was it a factor or not? Was partisanship just irrelevant, that it played no role, everything would have come out the same way ­­",
  "­­ without partisanship according the district court's finding?",
  "The district of ­­",
  "Well, I'm really surprised with the way you ­­ the way you read the district court's opinion. In footnote 10 of the district court's opinion, they set out the standard that they apply.",
  "It's on 62 ­­ I'm sorry ­­ 63a, running over into 64a. And in the ­­ the final paragraph that begins at the bottom of the page, \"For decision purposes, a majority of the panel made up of Judge Clifton and Judge Silver have concluded that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that partisanship predominated over legitimate redistricting considerations.\" Doesn't that mean that they found that there were some illegitimate considerations, or at least they ­­ and they assumed that partisanship was an illegitimate consideration?",
  "No, no.",
  "I'm sorry. Just to clarify your answer. So you think that what they said in footnote 10 only applies to one district.",
  "There are at least two arguments that could support your position. One is that it's one­person, one­vote, and what counts is giving each person an equal chance of affecting the outcome of the election. But total population figures are a good enough proxy for eligible voters. That's one possible argument. And that's ­­ that's what the census measures, and that's close enough. Another argument is that representational equality is the real basis, and therefore that's why you use population. So which argument are you making?",
  "It seems to me that the two interests are not always consistent. They can be in great conflict. You can have a situation if you ­­ if you want to equalize population, you may have a situation where you cause great inequality in the ­­ the chances of any ­­ of voters affecting the outcome of the election. On the other hand, if you choose eligible voters only, then you may have a situation where every person within two districts does not have an equal representation defined in some way in the legislature. I don't think you can just say, well, it's ­­ you know, we serve both. What do you do when they come into conflict?",
  "Well, can I ask you this? Who has standing to bring a Reynolds v. Sims claim? Is it anybody who is counted in the census?",
  "Are you going to tell me who has ­­",
  "Are you going to tell me who has standing or not?",
  "That includes everybody who is counted in the census.",
  "It includes ­­",
  "It includes aliens. It includes prisoners.",
  "It includes undocumented aliens.",
  "But does it include all those groups?",
  "Does it include members of all of those groups?",
  "Isn't your argument that voters are ­­ are irrelevant?",
  "What would you say about the extreme case ­­ I mean, your time is going to going to expire ­­ an extreme case. And maybe this would never come up, but what if it did? Suppose you have a district ­­ you have a rural district, and suppose it's a State where the ­­ the total number of ­­ the total population per district is ­­ is fairly small. You have a rural district with a huge prison and very few other inhabitants. So you ­­ and you have a neighboring district that has no prison. So in one district, you have that 10 percent of the population are eligible voters; and the other district, 90 percent of the ­­ the population are eligible voters. That would be okay?",
  "Could I come back to the issue of classroom diversity? Because that does seem to me to be something that could be measured. And maybe there's evidence in the record that measures it. I don't know. So that's what I want to ask you. But the University knows which students, even if ­­ assuming that the students don't know, this University knows which students were admitted because they were in the top 10 percent and which were not. And presumably they have a record of all of the classes and which students enrolled in which classes. And so it would seem to me to be possible to determine whether the students who were admitted under the 10 percent plan were less likely to choose to enroll in the classes in which minorities are underrepresented than the students who were admitted under holistic review. Now, maybe that's in the record. I haven't found it. Is there anything in the record to show that?",
  "Well, the issue in this case is not whether the University can have holistic review.",
  "The issue is whether they can have as a component of holistic review after they have taken into account other characteristics that are not dependent on race; they can add race as an additional characteristic. And so if it were ­­ is there ­­ would there be any way of determining, if there were a remand, which of the non­top 10 admittees were admitted solely because of race? In other words, these students would not have been admitted taking into account leadership and family, education and socioeconomic background and hardship and everything else.",
  "Well, on that point, can you determine which of the holistic admittees would not have been admitted if race was not added to the ­­ to the determination?",
  "That's not really my question. My question was if you look at an individual person, can you tell whether that person was admitted because ­­ solely because of race? Whether that person would not have been admitted were it not for the fact that the person was an African­American or Hispanic?",
  "What ­­ one of the things I find troubling about your argument is the suggestion that there is something deficient about the African­American students and the Hispanic students who are admitted under the top 10 percent plan. They're not dynamic. They're not leaders. They're not change agents. And I don't know what the basis for that is.",
  "It's ­­ really it's based on a terrible stereotyping that ­­",
  "What is the basis for that ­­",
  "Yeah. But what is the basis for saying that? That's what I don't understand. It's kind of the assumption that if the ­­ if a student ­­ if a black student or a Hispanic student is admitted as part of the top 10 percent plan, it has to be because that student didn't have to compete against very many whites and ­­ and Asians. In ­­ in the high school class, it's a really pernicious stereotype.",
  "I don't doubt that that is one of the things that it does, and I would have thought that that would be something that you would regard as beneficial.",
  "Wasn't that the ­­ the reason for adopting affirmative action in the first place because there are people who have been severely disadvantaged through discrimination and ­­ and lack of wealth, and they should be given a benefit in admission ­­",
  "­­ but that's one ­­ one of the things that it does, but it's not the only thing that it does.",
  "This is a statistic that jumped out at me, which it seems to me contrary to the stereotype on which the Fifth Circuit panel proceeds and on which you proceed. Of the African­American and Hispanic students who were admitted under the top 10 percent plan, 21 percent had parents who had either a bachelor's degree or a four­year degree. And for the holistic admittees, African­Americans and Hispanics, it's 26 percent. This is from a Class of 2008. So there isn't ­­ it seems to me it refutes the idea that all of these minority students who were admitted under ­­ or most of them admitted under the 10 percent plan come just from these predominantly overwhelmingly black and Hispanic schools with poor students. It's just ­­ it doesn't seem to be true.",
  "Well, on that subject, I don't know of any ­­ you haven't mentioned in your briefs anything that the University of Texas has done to increase racial diversity at the classroom level, other than this admissions program. And I mentioned during your ­­ your friend's argument a way in which you could determine whether the top 10 admittees are any more or less likely to enroll in classes ­­ small classes where there is a lack of racial diversity than the holistic admittees. And I don't see ­­ and you haven't made any effort, as far as I can tell, to measure that.",
  "But I don't ­­ you could have determined whether this is ­­ whether the admission ­­ the addition of race to the holistic equation has done anything to increase classroom diversity.",
  "And you haven't done that.",
  "No. As ­­ as comparing, this goes back to your ­­ your underlying claim is there's something deficient about the top 10 admittees, and I ­­ maybe ­­ if you have ­­ do you have evidence that they are less likely to ­­ to enroll in the classes where there's a lack of classroom diversity ­­",
  "Well, I ­­ but that's where I'm looking for evidence that that's true.",
  "What is it ­­ what is it ­­ have you looked at the top 10 percent admittees, for example, to see how many of them are leaders, which is certainly ­­ and certainly a legitimate factor to look for, students who are leaders. At ­­ do you say, well, there are ­­ there are just not very many leaders here; these are students who all they do is study. There's no evidence of that as far as I can tell.",
  "I don't know what that ­­",
  "I don't know what that proves. Sure. I ­­ I'm sure that there are holistic admittees who were great students. They made a wonderful contribution to the university. I'll ­­ I don't know whether you're going to be able to determine that they would have not ­­ they would not have been admitted if race hadn't been taken into account. They probably ­­ they would have ­­ many of them would have been. Maybe all of them. But beyond that, what is to say that there are not comparable students who were among the top 10 percent admittees? I bet there are.",
  "I ­­ I could use ­­ I can use the help.",
  "Well ­­ well, that's my question. But ­­",
  "Well, there's an aspect of the holistic review process done at the University of Texas which may militate against the admission of African­American and Hispanic students for a ­­ an ostensibly race­neutral reason, and that is, that as I understand it, standardized test scores count pretty heavily in that process. One of the things the University says it's looking for is students with high SAT scores who are not in the top 10 percent of their class. And there are many who think that SAT scores and ACT scores are culturally biased. So if you put less emphasis on that, you might not have the numbers that you just recited. Well, it's rather strange that we ­­ we construct the process that may disadvantage African­American and Hispanic students for an ostensibly race­neutral reason. So then we have to add race in as a special factor to counteract that.",
  "I thought the ­­ I thought the record showed the top ten admittees have a higher grade point average than the holistic African­American and Hispanic admittees.",
  "But, I mean, once they get to ­­",
  "Once they get to ­­ the SAT is supposed to predict how you are going to do in college. And I thought the record showed that the students who have lower SAT scores but did better as a ­­ by measure by high school rank did better at the University of Texas; isn't that ­­ isn't that the case?",
  "But do you think that the African­American and Hispanic students who were admitted under the top 10 percent plan make inferior officers when compared to those who were admitted under holistic review?",
  "Do you think that the ­­ that the ROTC graduates from the University of Texas make superior officers to those who ­­ who graduate from, let's say, Texas A&M or Texas Tech?",
  "Now, that's certainly important, but to come back to my first question, is there anything to suggest that the top 10 percent students are less likely to enroll in ROTC or, when they do, they're not as good as the ­­ as the holistic admittees?",
  "Is there any history in American labor management relations, at least going back, I don't know what, 75, 80 years of employers paying for unions? I thought the union movement was against this long ago.",
  "Before you get ­­",
  "Before you get into that, could I just ask you a preliminary question that came up earlier in the argument? Do you think that the California Teachers Association is an agency of the State of California?",
  "Where does the ­­ where does the State of California think the line should be drawn? A provision of California law ­­ this is Section 3546(b) of the ­­ of the California Government Code ­­ says that agency fees may be used for, quote, \"the cost of lobbying activities designed to secure advantages in wages, hours, and other conditions of employment, in addition to those secured through meeting and negotiating with the employer.\" Is that constitutional?",
  "Well, one of the questions is whether the ­­ whether Abood is workable. So I do think it's relevant to know whether you think that is on one side of the line or the other.",
  "Well, no, Mr. Frederick ­­",
  "Well, opt­in is ­­ opt­out is not always as easy as you ­­ as you say. In one of our prior cases, I think that anybody who wanted to opt out had to send a certified letter within a certain period of time. Now, suppose somebody says I don't want to pay this year. I don't want to ­­ I ­­ I never want to pay. What is the justification for saying that person has to opt out every single year?",
  "Well, Pickering is ­­ Pickering is the heart of your argument, so I ­­ I do want to ask you a couple of questions about it. Is it different from the situation here in several respects? One was brought out. Pickering ­­ the Pickering cases involve the termination or the discipline of a public employee after ­­ a single employee after the employee has made a statement that ­­ to which the employer objects. This is a prospective rule that applies to a huge category of employees. The second is whether restrictions on what employees can say are the same as compelling an employee to make a statement or subsidizing a statement.",
  "So as to the ­­ as to the latter ­­",
  "­­ there are circumstances, are there not, in which the Department of Justice could terminate or take an adverse employment action against a DOJ employee for something that that employee says as a citizen on a question of public concern. That could be done, could it not?",
  "Are there any circumstances in which the Department of Justice could compel an employee to make a statement ­­",
  "­­ as a ­­",
  "­­ as a ­­ as a private citizen?",
  "Well, I ­­ when ­­ when ­­ when a union is bargaining about a matter of ­­ of public concern, you're saying that that's ­­ that is not the same as commenting on a matter of public concern?",
  "Let me give you a hypothesis of what he may have been saying, because I think this may be a little bit too hard on the judge. This was an unusual prosecution. It was a murder prosecution where there was no evidence of motive. I think that's pretty rare. The judge may have been saying something like this: I have ­­ I have identification evidence here. And by the way, I ­­ I read the ­­ the whole ­­ everything ­­ the whole record and ­­ that's in the appendix and the closing argument of defense counsel. There was no ­­ the defense here was not that these were witnesses who made an honest mistake. They just didn't get a good opportunity to see the ­­ to see the perpetrator. The ­­ the ­­ argument of the defense, as I read it very clearly, was that something was going on here and these two witnesses were identifying ­­ were ­­ were falsely ­­ knowingly identifying the wrong person. Something was going on. There's evidence that the victim was selling drugs, very strong evidence that the victim was selling drugs, and that's what was going on here. And so the judge said ­­ may have said to himself, why does the ­­ the ­­ why would the accused take a baseball bat and beat this kid, this 17­year­old kid who has a lot of drugs in his pockets, riding around on a bike? Why would he just beat this kid to death? And there ­­ he ­­ I would be concerned about finding this ­­ the defendant guilty if I thought there was no motive in this case. But I can see that there could well be a motive in this case, because people in the drug trade kill each other. And that seems to be exactly what was going on here. Is that ­­ is that not a fair interpretation of what the judge was saying?",
  "Yes.",
  "The one statement that the judge made that you claim is utterly unsupported by the evidence, I gather, is the statement: \"Larry Owens knew he was a drug dealer.\"",
  "That's the ­­ that's the only one?",
  "Now, there ­­ could ­­ there's some evidence from which one might infer that. It might be insufficient. It would depend on the standard of review. But there's evidence that ­­ that Nelson, the victim, was selling drugs. Could you not infer ­­ could a reasonable finder of fact not infer from the record here that this kid, this 17­year­old kid with 40 packages of drugs, who's hanging around in front of this ­­ in front of this bar, was there for the purpose of selling drugs?",
  "And the ­­ and the ­­ the defendant walked up to ­­ there's evidence that the defendant walked up to this kid standing in front of the ­­ of the bar selling drugs, and spoke to him for some period of time, right?",
  "Yes, but there's evidence of that, if ­­ if you believe that, that that took ­­ that took place, right?",
  "There's evidence of that. So could someone infer from those two facts that ­­ that if this kid was pretty openly selling drugs and the defendant walked up and spoke to him to some ­­ for some period of time, he knew what he was doing?",
  "Now, the question on ­­ on the merits of ­­ putting aside the issues of ­­ of AEDPA and harmless error, when would it ­­ when does it violate due process for a judge in a bench trial to make a finding on a fact that is not needed for conviction? And what case of ours ­­",
  "­­ sets out the standard for that?",
  "What is the ­­",
  "What is the standard?",
  "Well, I'm trying to figure out what the standard is, if you could put it in words. Suppose that the ­­ the trial judge had made a finding, like the ­­ the court of appeals appears to, about the ­­ the ­­ the time of nautical twilight, and suppose the trial judge was wrong on that. Then what? So the trial judge has made a finding of fact on a fact that's not necessary for conviction. Might conceivably have some relevance to the determination. So what is the due process standard for determining whether that requires a new trial?",
  "It depends ­­ when you're reading this ­­ in reading what the judge said, it depends on ­­ the reasonableness of what the judge said may depend on whether you think that the judge inferred that Larry Owens killed the victim because he knew he was a drug dealer, or whether the judge was ­­ in attempting to fill in the blanks of this case, inferred that he knew he was a drug dealer from the fact that there was proof that he killed him.",
  "So if you know that the victim is a drug dealer and the defendant talked to the victim, and then the defendant proceeded to beat his brains out with a baseball bat, you could probably infer from that the reason why he did it was that he knew he was a drug dealer, could you not?",
  "Well, you say that when there is a ­­ excuse me ­­ a miscalculation of the Guidelines range, that should give rise to a rebuttable presumption that the miscalculation affected the sentence that the judge imposed.",
  "And what does that mean? Does that mean that the ­­ the burden of persuasion shifts to the prosecution?",
  "Well, suppose there's no evidence, as ­­ as will ­­ may very often be the case. Suppose the judge says ­­ imposes a sentence within what the judge believes to be the Guideline range but says nothing whatsoever beyond that, and it turns out that that is not the correct Guidelines range, so that there's no evidence one way or the other about what the judge would have done had the judge understood the correct Guidelines range. What outcome in that situation?",
  "So that means that the burden of persuasion in that situation is on the prosecution.",
  "Your argument has some appeal on the facts of this case because the judge sentenced the defendant to a sentence at the bottom of what the judge understood to be the Guideline range. But would your argument apply to any sentence that was within both the original and the correct Guideline range? Suppose the judge here had sentenced your client to 87 months, which I ­­ I think is the top of the correct Guideline range. Would the same ­­ would you ­­ can you infer from that that the judge would not have imposed that sentence had the judge understood that ­­ the judge thought that the top was 96, judge chose 87, that happens to fall within the correct Guideline range. On those facts, would you infer that the judge would have imposed a lesser sentence?",
  "Why would you ­­",
  "How about ­­ I mean, the question is, if the judge ­­ the judge thinks it's 77 to 96 and chooses 87, which is within that range, and it turns out the correct range is 70 to 87, so the 87 is within the correct range as well ­­ it's the top of the correct range ­­ what ­­ what reason would there be to infer ­­ why would there be a natural probability that the judge would have given a lesser sentence if the judge thought that the top was 87 as opposed to 96? The judge obviously thought in that situation the correct sentence is ­­ is 87.",
  "Well, can you give us an example of a Guidelines error that would qualify for ­­ qualify as a plain­error except for its failure to satisfy the fourth prong of Olano?",
  "If we ­­ if we accept the ­­ the proposition that in every case in which there is an incorrect identification of the Guidelines at the time of sentencing there has to be a remand, unless the government can prove with some sort of evidence that it was harmless, would there be any difference between the standard in a case where there was an objection and a case where there was no objection?",
  "Is it the ­­ is it the use of the case name in the ­­ or the number in the statute that is the offending characteristic? I imagine that a ­­ a ­­ a creative drafter could draft a statute that makes no reference to a particular case or to particular cases but could put so many limitations on the scope of the law that, in fact, it applies only to one case or to a small number of cases exactly the ones that Congress wants to target. Congress does that; is it different?",
  "Based on what you said this morning, I don't really understand the ­­ excuse me ­­ the limiting principle of your argument. You've said that the number of cases is not determinative, there could be a great many cases. And you've said that the naming of the ­­ the cases isn't significant, and it might not even be significant whether the case has been filed yet. So if you put all that together, what is the principle that you're ­­",
  "Well, could it be that Congress just thinks that's very unfair and that's why they haven't done it?",
  "You think the issue here is the protection of the judiciary rather than providing a certain element of equal treatment for the people who are the litigants in the case? I would think it would be the opposite.",
  "I don't understand ­­ I don't understand your answer. What ­­ what expressive activity did he engage in? He wasn't ­­ he was not allegedly demoted for failing to support the mayor. He was allegedly demoted for seemingly supporting the mayor's opponent.",

  "He may have broader substantive rights under New Jersey law. I would be somewhat surprised if that were not the case. The civil rights to which this ­­ the New Jersey statute refers may refer to rights under the New Jersey constitution or other New Jersey laws.",
  "And the question in this case seems to me to be highly artificial. It's sort of ­­ it's like a law school hypothetical.",
  "How often will it be the case that an employee will be unable to allege any expression or any association that is protected by the ­­ the First Amendment? It seems to me quite rare. And it may be that this case comes to us the way it does because the plaintiff was dealing with two things, one was the First Amendment, and the other ­­ I mean one was the issue that's ­­ the question of his motivation, and the other was this alleged policy prohibiting any kind of political activity. Even in the ­­ the person who is just apathetic, is there not a ­­ a First Amendment right to be ­­ say, I don't ­­ I don't like politics, I don't want anything to do with politics, I'm not going to register, I'm not going to vote?",

  "What was the basis for the Ninth Circuit's decision? Was it limited to navigable waters?",
  "What was the basis for the decision?",
  "Well, before you get to that, could we begin with what the Ninth Circuit decided? You're entitled to defend the judgment on any ground that you like, but ­­ that was presented below, but the only issue we have to ­­ we have to reach is the correctness of the Ninth Circuit's decision. Now, I understand what the Ninth Circuit to have held, to be this, that the hovercraft rule is not barred by the second sentence of Section 103(c) of ANILCA, because the hovercraft rule does not apply only in Alaska, because it applies throughout the country. Is that ­­ that's a correct understanding of what they held?",
  "Well, no. I want to ­­ I understand the ­­ the holding ­­ and I ­­ I stand ready to be corrected ­­ to be what I stated: That the hovercraft rule is not barred because it isn't Alaska­specific. And, I mean, you filed a 58­page brief and, as I read it, you didn't get to the reason that the Ninth Circuit based its decision on until page 49, and you devoted exactly a paragraph to it. And why don't you concede that it's wrong? It's a ridiculous interpretation, is it not?",
  "Well, you ­­ you want to talk about waters, and ­­ and after this question I won't say anything more on this, but is the Ninth Circuit's holding limited to waters? The ­­ the State of Alaska on page 20 and 21 of their brief cite a notice in the Federal Register by the Park Service in which they defend the regulation of nonfederal oil and gas activities on the basis of Sturgeon, on the ground that Section 103(c) of ANILCA applies only to Alaska­specific regulations. And since these are not Alaska­specific, those ­­ those regulations apply. So they understand it to apply to something more than just navigable waters.",
  "It's solely to apply to Alaska ­­",
  "Solely to apply to nonpublic units to lands in Alaska.",
  "What can you do about why this provision that you ­­ you reproduce on 7a gets around the first section of 103(c)? This ­­ that provision allows regulation of waters within Service units, but the first section, as I read it, says that nonpublic land within the boundaries of ­­ of a CSU is not part of the CSU.",
  "Let's say that part of a river is within a CSU. And do you read this statute to mean that the ­­the Park Service could regulate boating 500 miles downstream from that part of the ­­ on that river, because it's relating to waters that are within the CSU?",

  "You ­­ you referred to the nature of the infringement. Is that the only thing that's involved here? Are any of the Petitioners asking for enhanced damages based on litigation misconduct, for example?",
  "We have to decide whether enhanced damages can be awarded solely based on litigation misconduct. That would seem to be a separate question. Or you said that the main thing involved is the nature of the infringement. So what is the issue before us?",
  "Are courts going to be able to assess the state of mind of the infringer at the time of the infringer's conduct without getting into communications with the ­­ with the company's attorneys?",
  "Well, this ­­ you see, you had the case where at the time when the ­­ the question of enhanced damages is decided, the judge can see that the defense was able to ­­ with the help of good lawyers, was able to put on an objectively reasonable, although unsuccessful, defense. How are you going to be able to show that the infringer did not have that same information at the time of the conduct in question?",
  "The recklessness decision here seems different from those that generally come up. But maybe you can provide an example where this occurs outside of this context. Usually, to determine whether someone was reckless, you have to assess the ­­ the nature of the risk, the severity of the risk. And in the typical tort case, the severity of the risk may seem greater at the time of trial than it did at the time of the tortfeasor's action, because someone has been harmed. But in this situation, the ­­ the degree of the risk seems smaller at the time of the determination of enhanced damages than it may have been at the time of ­­ of the infringement. And I can't think of another ­­ because it's a legal risk. And the first determination may not have been made with the assistance or very intense analysis by attorneys, and then the latter time, the attorneys are very much involved. Is there any other situation where a recklessness determination has those characteristics?",

  "All right. Could Congress enact a statute under ­­ under Raich, based on the reasoning of Raich, prohibiting the theft of a controlled substance just as it has put ­­ enacted statutes prohibiting the growing of marijuana or the production of other controlled substances?",
  "Could it enact a statute that makes it a crime to steal a controlled substance, exercising its Commerce Clause authority under the reasoning of Raich?",
  "On a case­by­case basis. Then why can it prohibit the growing of marijuana across the board without proving anything about the particular marijuana in question, but according to you, it cannot prohibit the sale of ­­ I'm sorry, the theft of marijuana?",
  "Why is that needed ­­ why is that not needed in a situation in which the person is growing marijuana? For personal use?",
  "I don't think there's any question that this is a jurisdictional element and the jurisdictional element has to be proven. That's not the issue. The issue is the meaning of the jurisdictional element. And if the jurisdictional element means, as interpreted in Raich, and it's a ­­ you know, it's a controversial area of constitutional law, but it's a precedent and you're not challenging it ­­ so the jurisdictional element as interpreted in that case is anything that has an effect on ­­ anything ­­ any purely ­­ any local activity that is of a type which, if taken in the aggregate, would have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, that falls within the Commerce Clause. If the jury is instructed in that way, and that's basically the way I think it was instructed here, all they have to find is that there was a theft of ­­ there was a robbery of drugs, and it had some effect on the supply of drugs.",
  "Yeah, well, that's ­­ that's the ­­ that's what Raich ­­ that's the interpretation of the Commerce Clause. Do you want the jury to decide what the Commerce Clause means?

  "But the ­­ as originally set up, CPV had no incentive to ­­ to bid anything other than zero; isn't that right? All it was interested in was clearing the market.",
  "And that affects the dynamic of the ­­ of the PJM auction, does it not?",
  "Of course.",
  "Well, I don't understand your position. You're ­­ you're arguing that FERC does not think that this adversely affects the auction? Is that what you're saying?",

  "You're arguing as if they're not even here.",
  "Well, why doesn't the ­­ the MOPR correct the problem?",
  "But the mens rea of recklessness could apply to the act of touching or to whether the act is offensive. Now, under Maine law, to which of those does it apply? It doesn't necessarily have to apply to both.",
  "So if someone recklessly touches another person and that is offensive, that's a battery under Maine law?",
  "And what happened in that case?",
  "No, I mean what were the facts? What did this person do that was ­­ involved a reckless touching?",
  "Well, that ­­ that seems like the recklessness there goes to the ­­ the offensive nature of the touching, not to the touching itself.",
  "In other words, there's the act of touching, so he ­­ he went to shake her but he didn't intend to touch her?",
  "I don't really understand the ­­ the answer. He didn't intend to touch her at all? That was his intent?",
  "Okay. Well, that's what I'm saying. They are two different things. Did the ­­ does the person intend to touch ­­ does the person intend to touch in an offensive way?",
  "And so then it seems like your answer to my question is that it is in the latter that has the mens rea of recklessness.",
  "Do you think that prosecutors, when they are State prosecutors, when they are charging these domestic violence offenses, are going to be looking ahead to the consequences of the particular charge for Federal firearms laws?",
  "Do you think that's realistic?",
  "Well, let me ask you this, which is somewhat unrelated. So Congress passes this statute, and they do not want a person who has been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to have a firearm. Okay? What was the year when that was passed?",
  "Okay. 1996. That's what they want to do. And you agree that a ­­ that the offense of battery falls within that definition; am I right?",

  "Well, I under ­­ I understand that, but I thought you agree that \"battery\" in some sense falls within the definite ­­ falls within the category of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.",
  "Yeah. Okay. Well, if you agree with that ­­ and then your argument is that they just ­­ all they think about across the street is the common law. So battery ­­ common law battery, they don't care what the actual statutes are around the country. They are just interested in the offense of common law battery.",
  "I mean, is that realistic?",

  "Well, what if the case was simply in the office and he had supervisory responsibility over everything that occurs in the office, but it's a big office. If a question arose, somebody could bring it to him, but there isn't any indication of personal involvement. Would that be enough?",
  "You see, the problem ­­",
  "Yeah. The problem that ­­ that is presented by this case is not ­­ is where this constitutional line is going to be drawn. You want us to get into ­­ get pretty deeply into the issue of a constitutional recusal policy for judges. So it's really not enough to just say what happened here was bad. Let's assume that ­­ that that is the case. Assume for the sake of argument ­­ I'm not saying one way or the other ­­ but how far does this go? And that's what I'm ­­ that's what I'm interested in. So supervisory authority would be enough, you said, but it depends on the issue? Why would it depend on the issue?",
  "But that's the ­­ that's the line­drawing problem. Why does it matter that it's the death penalty? What if it was not a capital case, but he ­­ he signed the indictment?",
  "What if he signed the indictment?",

  "What do you do with the fact that Chief Justice Castille was not solely responsible for the decision in this case? This was a decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

Would that decision still be invalid on the ground that he shouldn't have been participating?",
  "Doesn't that mean it's not structural error?",
  "So he might have persuaded a majority to vote to reverse, and then he turned around and he wrote an opinion saying that there should be an affirmance.",
  "If we agree with you, doesn't that lead inevitably to the rule that a majority of the judges on a multi­judge panel have the authority to require the recusal of a colleague?",
  "Well, wouldn't they ­­ wouldn't that have to be the consequences? Suppose that ­­ suppose you make a recusal motion. You want Chief Justice Castille recused, and the other justices on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court say we think that he should be recused, and we're afraid that if we go ahead with this decision with his participation, the decision is going to be subject to attack down the road. And we can't allow that to happen, so we're going to require him to be recused in order to prevent him from tainting our decision­making process or creating at least the appearance that the decision­making process is tainted. So that would have to be a consequence of your rule, would it not?",
  "They could just take their chances.",
  "And he says, no, I disagree with you.",
  "Can we do that ­­",
  "­­ without holding that there was a dupe ­­ a constitutional violation? What would be our authority to require them to do it over again?",
  "When was the last time a prisoner was executed in Pennsylvania, other than those instances in which the prisoner decided that he did not want to pursue appellate remedies?",

  "We're talking about ­­",
  "We are talking about a constitutional recusal rule which would have very serious consequences. So if it's ­­ even if it isn't absolutely necessary that that rule be very clear, certainly it is highly desirable that it be very clear so that everybody can determine with a degree of certainty when the time ­­ when the decision is made whether recusal is constitutionally required or not. And I really don't see a clear rule that would encompass this situation, other than a rule that said that a judge may ­­ is required by the Constitution to recuse in any case in which the judge had personal participation as a prosecutor. Anything other than that seems to me to be pretty fuzzy, but that would be a pretty far­reaching rule. So can you think of one that is less ­­ that is not as far­reaching as that but nevertheless is clear? If we talk about the number of years that passed or how significant the ­­ how significant the issue was or things of that nature, those are all going to be subject to a lot of uncertainty and debate.",
  "In ­­ in ­­",
  "Well, I ­­",
  "In this case, did the other justices of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court know about the recusal motion at the time of the decision?",
  "Well, this may be an extreme case, but if we do not say any personal participation requires recusal under the Constitution, what other clear line can you give us?",
  "Under ­­",
  "Yeah.",
  "You have a textual argument that I ­­ that I understand, but one of the arguments you mentioned at the outset was that an examination of the legislative history shows that Congress intended to produce the sort of result that was produced here, and I wonder if that's really a plausible argument. If you're correct, then two things happen; at least two things happen. One, Kansas retains on its record an inaccurate ­­ inaccurate information about the presence of a sex offender, which can have a lot of adverse consequences for a lot of people. I don't see why Congress would have wanted that to remain. And do you really think Congress was unconcerned about the United States exporting pedophiles to the Philippines or to other countries? Do you think that ­­ that they were not concerned about not only the human rights implications of that, but our relations with other countries?",
  "Well, if I could then come back to Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical of someone like your client who moves from Kansas to Illinois, what, in the language of the statute, would prevent that person from going to the registry office in Kansas before departing and reporting there that he was moving to Illinois and his new address in Illinois would be whatever it would be? Why does that not fit under this ­­ under the language of the statute? Or would you agree that it does?",
  "Well, if you ­­ if you agree to that, then I don't see why ­­ why there is a difference between that situation and the situation where the ­­ the person leaves Kansas and goes to the Philippines.",
  "Why would it not be ­­",
  "Why would it not be sufficient under 42 U.S.C. 16913(c)?",
  "Well, it says, \"shall not, later than three business days after each change of residence, appear in person in at least one jurisdiction involved pursuant to subsection (a) and inform that jurisdiction of the change of address.\" So prior to leaving, he is within the period of not later than what ­­ than three business days after the change of residence. And at that time when he goes to the registry office in Kansas, he is residing in Kansas. So he falls within subsection (a).",
  "In terms of ­­",
  "In terms of Federal policy, hasn't Congress, by the enactment of the new statute and in other ways, evidenced a belief that the United States should not be exporting its pedophile problems to other countries?",
  "And countries like the Philippines where the ­­ the Petitioner here went are known places that are attractive to sex tourists who go there to abuse young children and ­­ hasn't Congress evidenced a concern about this both for the human rights aspects of the problem and, also, I would think, for relations with the government of the Philippines?",
  "Well, there is very little specific evidence in the record in this case with respect to why any particular clinic closed. Basically, your argument is that the law took effect, and after that point, there was a decrease in the number of clinics. So suppose you win here, and the State then examines what happened in each of these clinics and comes up with evidence showing that in quite a few instances, the closure was due to other factors. And so then they would ­­ then could they take the position, well, the decision of this Court holding that the law is facially unconstitutional is not binding on us by res judicata, and so you would have to sue them again, and they would be able to make the same argument you're making now. Is that correct?",
  "What's the difference?",
  "Was it that ­­ was that their burden?",
  "As to how many, of the total that you claim closed, do you have direct evidence about the reason for the closure?",
  "Yeah. And as to how many ­­ how many are you claiming total closed as a result of the law?",
  "And of the 20, how ­­ as to how many do you have direct evidence?",
  "Because if ­­ if you go through this ­­ now we're not talking about a huge number of facilities. I really don't understand why you could not have put in evidence about each particular clinic and to show why the clinic closed. And as to some of them, there is ­­ there's information that they closed for reasons that had nothing to do with this law. Now, maybe when you take out all of those, there still would be a substantial number, and enough to make your case. But I ­­ I don't understand why you didn't put in direct evidence. I mean, I could give you examples: Planned Parenthood Center for Choice, Bryan, Texas. Is that one of the ones you're talking about?",
  "Okay. There's a news report. Planned Parenthood and ­­ and the Huffington Post reported that this was closed as a result of the 2011 Texas Women's Health Program bill, which cut funding for family planning services. It's not the law that we're talking about here.",
  "Well, I understand that. And you put quite a bit of evidence that's not in the record in your brief. But my point is why is there not direct evidence about particular clinics?",
  "Is it correct that the number of ambulatory surgical centers performing abortion has increased by 50 percent since this law went into effect?",
  "Well, one ­­ one quick question about capacity. I don't want to take your rebuttal time. But your co­counsel put in ­­ is also litigating a case like this in Louisiana. And in that case, the plaintiffs were able to put in evidence about the exact number of abortions that were performed in all of the facilities. Why could that not have been done here? Why wasn't it done here?",
  "Is this true of every provision of the ­­ of the ASC law?",
  "Not the regulations ­­ yes, in the regulations.",
  "Every single provision. Then why was the whole thing held to be unconstitutional?",
  "But there are ­­ there are things that go ­­ that go ­­ I haven't checked everything as compared the abortion ­­ the prior abortion clinic licensing law against the ASC requirements, but there are some where there's an increase in what's required. It seems pretty reasonable. Under the ­­ under the ­­ the old ­­ the old law, there had to be a nurse, but not necessarily a registered nurse. Under the new law, there has to be a registered nurse who has a CPR certificate. So do you think that's unreasonable to say that there has to be a registered nurse who knows how to do CPR?",
  "Well, it's all ­­",
  "It's work, but maybe the district court should have done that work. I mean, I read through this, and I was surprised. I read through these regulations. I was surprised by how many are completely innocuous. And many of them have nothing to do ­­ they have to do with basic safety. They don't even have anything to do, in particular, with abortion. So the entrances to the clinic have to be at grade level. You have to have an elevator. The ­­ the corridors have to be wide enough so that you could bring in a stretcher if somebody has to be taken to the hospital. And ­­ and things of that nature ­­",
  "I don't know why things couldn't have been severed out, if there were some that were ­­",
  "There is no evidence ­­ there's no evidence of the actual capacity of these clinics. And why was that not put in? Particularly since, if we look at the Louisiana case, we can see that it's very possible to put it in. And some of the ­­ some of the numbers there are quite ­­ quite amazing. There's one ­­ a doctor there performed 3,000 abortions in a year. So we don't really know what the capacity of these ­­ of these ASC clinics ­­",

  "Would it not be the case that ­­ would it not be the case that a State could increase the ­­ the standard of care as high as it wants so long as there's not an ­­ an undue burden on the women seeking abortion? So, you know, if they could ­­ if they could increase the standard of care up to the very highest anywhere in the country and it wouldn't be a burden on the women, well, that would be a benefit to them.

  "Isn't it true ­­",
  "General, as to ­­ as to rogue facilities, which Justice Kagan just mentioned, one of the amicus briefs cites instance after instance where Whole Woman's facilities have been cited for really appalling violations when they were inspected: Holes in the floor where ­­ where rats could come in, the lack of any equipment to adequately sterilize instruments.

  "Could I ask a question, which is really highlighted by Justice Kagan's hypothetical? Because normally, were ­­ were it not for the Voting Rights Act, there would be a very simple answer to all of these questions, and that is that you cannot take race in account at all.

Suppose that it were possible for a woman who does not get contraceptive coverage under a grandfathered plan or under a plan offered by a church or under a plan offered by a religious nonprofit to obtain a contraceptive­only policy free of charge on one of the Exchanges. Why would that not be a least ­­ a less restrictive alternative?",
  "What ­­ what type of a burden does that impose? Is it because these ­­ these Exchanges are so unworkable, even with the help of a navigator, that ­­ that a woman who wants to get free contraceptive coverage simply has to sign up for that on ­­ on one of the Exchanges?",
  "So she'll have two insurance cards instead of one. She'll have one from the employer, and she'll have one from this plan, just as a lot of people have one insurance card for medical services and one for prescriptions ­­",
  "­­ for dental or vision.",
  "Well, we can talk ­­ we can talk about that in a minute, but continue with that.",
  "But why would that be? He would be ­­ he would be paid under the ­­ under the contraceptive plan.",
  "Well, you don't think that they would be willing to sell them if you subsidize them at 115 percent, which is what you were doing in the case of those who provide services under self­insured plans.",
  "What about the women ­­ what about the women in grandfathered plans ­­",
  "­­ under ­­ in grandfathered plans that offer no contraceptive coverage? What about them?",
  "But, you know, in the long run we're all dead. But what's going to happen in ­­",
  "­­ in ­­ in the interim? What was the reason why Congress did not require contraceptive coverage right away under the grandfathered plans? It required coverage right away under the grandfathered plans for 25­year­olds so that they could get coverage under their parents' health insurance plan. It would have been no great administrative difficulty for the grandfathered plans to put in contraceptive coverage, preventive care coverage right away, just as they did for the 25­year­olds. And yet Congress said, for the really important things, like covering the 25­year­old graduate student, yes, you have to do that right away. But for these other things, including what we're talking about today, you can continue to have ­­ not to provide that coverage for women as long as you maintain your grandfathered status.",
  "Well, but to ­­ to come back ­­ to come back to the point that you were making about the Americans with Disabilities Act, that certainly is a good point for the Americans with Disabilities Act. It can be very expensive to retrofit facilities to accommodate people with disabilities. But are you saying that the burden of simply instituting coverage for preventive care as it was done for coverage for 25­year­olds is comparable to making architectural changes?",
  "Could you ­­ could you address Mr. Clement's hypothetical about where the ­­ the government would come into a ­­ an unoccupied room in the Little Sisters facility that's not being used for anything. They don't interfere at all. They even pay rent. And they come in there, and they establish a Title X clinic, and they are distributing contraceptives on the Little Sisters property. And there's no financial burden. There's actually financial benefit to them. Is that different from the situation here, and if so, why?",
  "Well, you say in your brief, you admit in your brief that, at least in the case of the self­insured plan, the ­­ the notice or the ­­ the form or the notice becomes part of the plan. This is their health insurance plan established under ERISA, and you are putting a new objectionable element into the plan. Isn't that correct?",
  "But it ­­ it is ­­ it's their plan, and you admit that you are putting something into their plan that they object to on religious grounds.",
  "So the difference between that and Mr. Clement's hypothetical is that one involves something tangible, physical property, and the other involves something that's intangible.",
  "That's the distinction.",
  "Well, in the case of an insurance plan, isn't the insurance policy part of the plan? Isn't the insurance policy the way in which the ­­ the employer provides the benefits that are available under the plan?",
  "Well, for the employees who have to buy the plans on the Exchange because they work for a small employer and the employer doesn't offer health insurance, does that arrangement frustrate the government's compelling interest?",
  "Couldn't the Executive deal with the problem of what's available on the Exchanges at the present time in this way: Policies are available that provide comprehensive coverage. Could the Executive say, as a matter of our enforcement discretion, we are not going to take any action against insurers who offer contraceptive­only policies, and in fact, we are going to subsidize those insurers at 115 percent, just as we do in the situation of the self­insured plans?",
  "Why would that not be ­­ why would that not be a valid exercise of your enforcement discretion?",
  "Well, I understand you're saying it would be inadequate.",
  "But why would it be not something that you could do in accordance with your understanding of executive power?",
  "Why do you assume that the doctor to whom the women would go for other services under the plan would be unwilling to provide those services under a plan ­­ under a separate plan that covers contraceptives?",
  "Why do you make that assumption?",
  "Before you sit down, General Verrilli, could I just ask you this informational question about this particular situation of the Little Sisters? Their regular third­party administrator also will not provide ­­ has said it will not provide the coverage if ­­ even if they were to comply with the ­­ the form of the notice requirement. And, therefore, you say they probably cannot be ­­ there is probably no way under ERISA to obtain contraceptive coverage for their employees unless you can find another third­party administrator that you could deal with there. In that situation, would the Little Sisters still be subject to fines for failing to comply?",
  "Well, that's one way of characterizing what's involved here. But you could also ­­ it can also be said that, and it is true, that this is a case in which a great array of religious groups ­­ and it's not just Catholics and Baptists and Evangelicals, but Orthodox Jews, Muslim groups, the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints, an Indian tribe, the Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye ­­ have said that this presents an unprecedented threat to religious liberty in this country. What would you say to that?",
  "Well, aren't Titus and Spiller different in that there the assignee is suing on a judgment that was obtained in a forum where Article III didn't apply?",
  "Why isn't that irrelevant?"
