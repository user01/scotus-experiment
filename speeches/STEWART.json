  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The arbitrator in this case treated the employee's drug use as a serious offense. He considered it worthy of serious punishment. With respect to those aspects of the arbitrator's decision, the petitioner really has no complaint. Petitioner contends that the arbitrator's award is contrary to public policy only in that the arbitrator chose to impose a suspension of slightly over 3 months plus costs of the arbitration in lieu of outright discharge, and therefore the question is whether the punishment imposed by the arbitrator can reliably be said to conflict with public policy. This Court emphasized in Misco that a court asked to vacate an arbitral award in the labor context on the basis of public policy must draw that policy from positive law, from statutes and regulations.",
  "We would say that there are limited circumstances under which an arbitral award can be vacated even though the award would not compel the employer to violate positive law, and to give you a hypothetical example, the Department of Transportation has a regulation that says that a driver who is convicted of driving under the influence is disqualified from operating a commercial motor vehicle for a period of 1 year. Now, in a hypothetical case in which an employee was believed to have driven under the influence, was not convicted, but conceded at the arbitral proceeding that he had, in fact, driven while under the influence of alcohol and drugs, in such a case, if the arbitrator imposed a 3-month suspension and then put the person back behind the wheel, that would not literally compel the employer to violate positive law because there would be no conviction. But given that there was an alternative basis for feeling highly confident that the prohibited conduct had occurred, such an award would be explicable only on the ground that the arbitrator disagreed with the policy judgment reflected in the DOT regulations. But we do -- while we don't think that the vacatur of the award is limited to those situations in which a violation of positive law would otherwise occur, we do think that the relevant public policy must be drawn directly from positive law, and therefore the question is, is there anything in the testing act or the DOT regulations that identifies discharge as the mandatory penalty for a second drug offense or not, and in our view there's no way that the regulations or the statute can fairly be read to compel that conclusion.",
  "I think that's correct --",
  "-- and I think the DOT reg -- but I think the DOT regulations --",
  "We wouldn't say that, because in our view the DOT regulations provide an alternative basis for preventing that, that feared result from occurring. That is, regardless of whether the arbitrator orders this person reinstated, the person is not eligible under the regulations to drive a commercial vehicle until he complies with DOT's rehabilitation requirements. And if he's evaluated by the substance abuse professional, if the substance abuse professional certifies that he has complied with the recommended course of treatment and that the employer is therefore legally free to employ him again in driving a truck, that provides the basis for assurance that a person who poses a substantial risk will not be on the roads, and --",
  "The SAP's, as we refer to them, are not -- they're not certified by the Department of Transportation, but the regulations do specify the categories of people who are eligible to perform this service, and the regulations also make clear that the choice of a particular SAP is up to the employer unless the employer has delegated that power away through collective bargaining agreement, so the employer has the ultimate power to ensure that this important decision is not being entrusted to someone, somebody that the employer believes is insufficiently protective of the public safety.",
  "Well, we would certainly agree with the Chief Justice that there is also a strong policy reflected in the language of the Federal Arbitration Act in favor of enforcement of arbitration agreements in the commercial context. There is in the labor context the additional consideration of preserving industrial peace, but we don't -- I don't know that we would say that the two are different in kind. Now, certainly in the State system it is up to a State government to determine how it wants to allocate power among the branches, and therefore State courts may assume far greater authority to devise public policy to set aside contracts that violate it even if they aren't drawing the relevant public policy from positive law. That's up to the State system. But within the Federal system I think even whether within the FAA, or under the labor management statutes, there is a strong policy in favor of enforcement of contractual choices. And so in 1992 to 1994 the Department of Transportation conducted an extensive rule-making, it heard comments from a number of interested people, and its mandate from Congress was to consider both the need to protect the public safety against the ill effects of transportation employees who use drugs, and the testing act also included a congressional finding that rehabilitation is a critical component of any testing program. And it was the Department's mandate to balance those potentially competing objectives, and specifically with respect to the problem of a recidivist drug user, the initial regulation proposed by the Department of Transportation would have mandated a 60-day disqualification period. And I think, as Justice Breyer suggested, part of the irony of this case is that if that provision had been adopted, we think the petitioner would have no basis for challenging the arbitral award here, because if DOT had said, suspension of at least 60 days, and the arbitrator had imposed a suspension of a little over 3 months --",
  "I think it all depends on what powers the parties elect to confer upon the arbitrator. That is, if the collective bargaining agreement specified that the punishment for a first positive drug test will be a 30-day suspension followed by reinstatement if the individual has complied with the DOT regulations, I think there would be no room under the contract for the arbitrator to say, I'm not sufficiently confident that this person can do the job again, and therefore I'm ordering him discharged. And conversely, if the collective bargaining agreement said, anybody who violates the drug policy twice will be dismissed, the arbitrator wouldn't have authority to determine that really the policy in favor of rehabilitation was more important and therefore he should be given another chance. But where, as here, we have a collective bargaining agreement that gives the arbitrator very broad discretion to decide whether there is just cause in a particular case, we think the arbitrator would naturally look to public policy considerations, among others.",
  "And it would depend upon the authority entrusted to him --",
  "-- by the parties. And so the Department of Transportation considered a provision that would have imposed a mandatory 60-day suspension for recidivists. It seemed clear to us that if that provision had been adopted, the 90-day-plus suspension that was imposed here couldn't be said to violate public policy, and although it's not terribly clear from the Federal Register notice exactly why the Department declined to adopt that provision, it's very clear that the Department understood that the consequence of deleting that proposed rule was to leave to the contracting parties the determination whether reinstatement would occur even after a second positive test. That is the public policy as determined by the Department of Transportation. If there are no further questions --",
  "Not that I'm aware of.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves the application of exemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act to seven documents that pertain to the Federal Government's exercise of its responsibility to act as trustee for the property and natural resources of Indian tribes. Six of the seven documents were submitted by the Klamath tribes to the Department of the Interior at the Government's request. The seventh document was prepared by a DOI official and was provided to attorneys for the Klamath and --",
  "That's correct. The documents relate to the United States' representation of the tribes' interests in a pending Oregon stream adjudication as well as to the Bureau of Reclamation's management of the Klamath reclamation project during the period while that adjudication remains pending.",
  "At the time that the documents submitted, the Department of Interior or Bureau of Reclamation more specifically was attempting to prepare a long-term operations plan for the Klamath project.",
  "It has not been abandoned. The long -- no draft long-term plan has yet been issued, but the --",
  "It is still under preparation.",
  "It is still ongoing on a year-by- year basis the Bureau of Reclamation, or BOR, manages the Klamath project based on water availability during the course of that year. The idea behind the long-term operations plan, sometimes known as the Klamath project operations plan, or KPOP colloquially, was to devise a methodology whereby the Department would decide in advance how water would be distributed in both wet and dry years, where current practice has been at the beginning of the season to assess the likely availability of water and make a determination for that year. The preparation of KPOP in a sense interacts with the United States' representation of the tribes in the Oregon general stream adjudication, because it's the State of Oregon that will be making the final permanent determination as to who has what water rights and in what order of priority and, in connection with that adjudication, the United States has filed claims on behalf of the tribes, on behalf of the project, as well as on behalf of other Federal interests.",
  "We are not technically acting as their attorney. That is, the tribes have their own attorneys, but the United States acts as trustee. It has filed claims in the Oregon adjudication --",
  "The United States has filed claims on behalf of the tribes. With regard to virtually the entirety of the United States submission the tribes have filed a document that simply says, we accept and incorporate by reference the claims of the United States.",
  "With respect to a small fraction of the case the tribes have filed their own claim that differs marginally from that of the United States on their behalf, but I think there is nearly a 100-percent alignment of interests in the Oregon --",
  "That's correct.",
  "That's correct. The United States has also filed claims on behalf of the project and on behalf of other Federal interests. For instance, there is a wildlife refuge in the area for which the United States --",
  "I think we would certainly say that to the extent the submission were submitted -- to the extent the documents were submitted to the United States in its capacity as trustee, that is, with regard to the preparation of the United States' claims on the tribes' behalf, they would be privileged and confidential.",
  "In 1976 there was a legislative proposal that would have created a new FOIA exemption for all documents in the possession of a Government agency pertaining to the exercise of trust responsibilities, and that bill was never acted on. That bill would have accomplished an exemption from the FOIA that is significantly broader than the exemption we're asking for here. That is, the applicability of that exemption would not have turned on whether the documents came from the tribes initially and, perhaps more important, it wouldn't have turned on whether particular documents would be privileged from discovery in civil litigation. That is, the focus of the court of appeals' concern -- perhaps I should turn to page 2 of our brief, which sets forth the language of exemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act. Exemption 5 states that the requirement of compelled disclosure does not apply to matters that are, quote, interagency or intraagency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency, and --",
  "It certainly doesn't fit within the most common conception of what an interagency or intraagency memorandum would be. The courts of appeals have, over the past 30 years, devised a methodology for determining when documents that were created by persons outside the Government may nevertheless be regarded as sufficiently internal from a pragmatic point of view that they can qualify for the exemption.",
  "I think because they have come to the conclusion that some documents submitted by outside persons play a role in the agency's deliberations that is so similar to the role that a staff memorandum would play.",
  "They haven't referred to it as a consultative privilege, but they have certainly said that they have used outside consultants as an example of --",
  "There are really two different categories of cases in the courts of appeals, and one is as you suggest. That is, there are situations in which a person is consulted because he has preexisting expertise but no particular institutional perspective on the matter at issue, and there I think it is fair to say that the basis for the arrangement is that this person is serving in effect as a temporary employee, performing the role an employee would perform. There are other cases in the --",
  "No. We would say that the document needs to be submitted to the Government in its capacity as trustee. So, for example, if the Fish & Wildlife Service is making a determination as to whether a particular species should be listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act it's possible that the outcome of that listing decision might have a practical effect on the way in which tribal land can be used.",
  "Oh, the statute refers to interagency or intraagency memorandums and the courts of appeals, in determining what can be properly regarded as internal, have focused on the existence of a special relationship between the outside person and the government official, and in many instances the outside person, as I say, is one who fulfills the role of an agency employee.",
  "The tribe is not an agency.",
  "It is not covered under the most natural reading of that language. I think there is a sense in which these submissions are properly characterized as interagency, and that is when the Federal Government actively solicits advice and assistance, when it identifies the person from whom advice is sought, when it constructs the decision -- when it constructs the consultative process in a way that is reasonably designed to further the Government's own interests, the resulting document can be said to be internal in the sense that the circle begins and ends with the Government.",
  "Well, with respect to the existing court of appeals case law, certainly the consultant temporary employee is the paradigmatic example, but the D.C. Circuit has also applied this approach in cases such as Ryan and Public Citizen to Members of the Senate, to a former President who was advising the archivist regarding the proper disposition of records created during his term of office, where the idea was not that the person outside the Government was stepping into the shoes of an agency employee, or adopting an employee's perspective.",
  "But it was consulted precisely because it would have a distinct perspective on the proper manner of accomplishing the Government's objectives, and that's really --",
  "No, because the United States does not act as a trustee for the Water Users Association.",
  "I think the trust relationship is the thing that brings this case within a larger principle.",
  "It has not made claims on behalf of the water association. It has made claims on behalf of the project, but the association and --",
  "There are certainly aspects of the case on which we and the users are in agreement.",
  "I think to understand why, in our view, it is evenhanded, it's essential to explain that there are several component agencies within the Department of Interior, but two that are particularly important here, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Reclamation. Now, both the tribes and the water users corresponded with the Bureau of Reclamation, or BOR, and BOR received a FOIA request from both the tribes and the users association asking for the documents that the others had submitted, and for better or worse BOR turned everything over. BOR was absolutely evenhanded in divulging both tribal communications and the water users association communications. It may be that under our theory BOR should not have been quite so forthcoming, but it was. There was no disuniformity with respect to BOR. BIA was a different story. BIA is set up with the special responsibility of exercising the Government's trust responsibilities to the Indian tribes. It essentially corresponds with the Indian tribes, and it would be unusual for the water users to correspond with BIA at all. BIA was the subagency within the Department of the Interior that refused to disclose some of these documents, with one exception of the seven. One of the adjudication-related documents was addressed to the Regional Solicitor of the Department of the Interior. So primarily we are concerned with documents that were submitted to a subagency within DOI whose particular sphere of duty and expertise is the exercise of trust responsibilities for the tribes, and this Court in Nevada v. United States emphasized the BIA's unique mission, its separate juridical status --",
  "I mean, I guess I have two or three responses to that. First, you're correct that the BIA is not an independent agency. It is a subagency of DOI, and therefore is ultimately subject to DOI control. At the same time, the Government is attempting to deal in a pragmatic fashion with the sort of combination of responsibilities that no private party would ever be given. That is, things would certainly be cleaner from our point of view of DOI could either say, we will treat the tribes exactly like we treat everyone else, or it could say, we will treat the tribes exactly as a private trustee would treat the beneficiary, namely, show it a duty of undivided loyalty. It's clear, I think from first principles and from this Court's decision in Nevada v. United States, that the Department can't pursue either of those courses. It must on the one hand fulfill its trust responsibilities but on the other hand it has other responsibilities that would be considered conflicting if they were imposed on a private person, so giving BIA primary responsibility for the carrying out of the Department's trust mission is a pragmatic response to an admittedly messy situation. The other thing I would say is, we don't contend that the tribes are analogous to a consultant in the sense of stepping into the shoes of an agency employee or doing what an agency employee would otherwise do. To the contrary, we think the input from the tribes is essential if the Department is to carry out its trust responsibilities, but that's precisely because the tribes have an expertise and a perspective that no agency employee would have.",
  "Well, certainly --",
  "Well, again I would say, for better or for worse, the BOR did not favor the tribes vis- a-vis the water users. It was equally responsive to both FOIA requests. The only --",
  "Not whatever it gets from the tribes, but whatever the tribes submit to it in its capacity as trustee, so yes, our position would be, if the tribes approach BOR and say, in order to fulfill the United States' duties as trustee, the BOR must take the following management steps.",
  "I mean, I think it's -- obviously, one of the arguments advanced in favor of the legislation that was proposed in 1976 was that the legislation would clarify the ambiguity, would make it unnecessary to resolve difficult questions concerning the application of existing FOIA exemptions, but I think the Court has long taken the position that the FOIA should be implemented in a practical way, that it should be implemented in a way that doesn't interfere with the Government's performance of its substantive --",
  "I mean, certainly, if we are able to persuade the Court that the threshold language is satisfied here, that is that these documents are properly regarded as interagency or intraagency memorandums or letters, we would still have to persuade presumably the court of appeals on remand that the documents would be privileged --",
  "And in the past --",
  "I mean, with respect, I think the Court's general methodology has been to construe the threshold language of the various exemptions in a way that would protect the values that the body of the exemption is intended to protect, and the Court has said, in a shorthand formulation admittedly, that exemption 5 protects those documents, and only those documents that would be privileged in civil discovery. I mean, the point is, most of the work here is supposed to be done by the inquiry into whether there is actually an applicable privilege. It maybe that the threshold language will screen out some things that would be privileged in discovery, but there's no indication, either in the legislative history or in this Court's decisions, that the threshold language is supposed to screen out a lot. To take another example --",
  "But I think it's also worth emphasizing that the one alternative that I think is not clearly on the table is to give the threshold language an absolutely rigid literal interpretation. That is to say, nothing can be --",
  "I mean, I think the --",
  "I mean, I think the best analogy from the existing case law is to the Senators in Ryan and to the former President in Public Citizen. That is, these are people who were not literally part of any FOIA agency, and who were consulted not because they were expected to perform exactly the same role as an agency employee. Rather, they were consulted because they were believed to have a distinct institutional perspective.",
  "I mean, certainly the archivist was ultimately going to be making the determination whether particular documents would be made public or not, and in other private individuals such as Public --",
  "I don't know that it had progressed to quite that point, but certainly the point of the scheme was that private parties would like to have as much information as possible from the former President's records in order to do whatever type of research they wanted to do, and the former President was being consulted because of his own distinct perspective, and --",
  "Well, I think the -- certainly Congress over the years has revisited, has amended the FOIA in various respects. It's not --",
  "I mean, I think we are not -- I think we're not asking for a stretch, because the United States in its capacity as trustee, and in particular the Bureau of Indian Affairs, owes a duty of loyalty to the tribes, and certainly Federal policy for most of the 20th Century has been to exercise the trusteeship in a way that will promote values of tribal self-determination, so if the United States as trustee --",
  "I would agree that the tribes' potential financial interest in the income of the decision, the various decisionmaking processes is unlike interests that have been recognized in the past, but the United States is supposed to act as the trustee. One of the central duties of a trustee in virtually every context is to preserve a duty of confidentiality to the beneficiary, and so it would be strange to say that the tribe's status as a beneficiary, the tribe's interest in the trust corpus, is the very thing that causes its submissions to lose the confidentiality that they might otherwise have.",
  "I mean, certainly in litigation the particular needs of an individual requestor would be relevant in a way that they would not be relevant under the FOIA, so I think your question -- the premise of your question is correct in two different respects. First, the fact that these are in our view interagency documents doesn't automatically mean that they would even satisfy the second part of the FOIA test. Second, even if they satisfied the second part of the FOIA test in the sense that they would not be routinely discoverable, that wouldn't by itself eliminate the possibility that they could be discovered by a litigant with a particular need. If I may, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "I'd like to address the question of the role of the Government in allocating a scarce benefit, and particularly with regard to the Oregon general stream adjudication. I think as the Court is certainly aware, the way that a priority system of water rights works is the most senior water user gets whatever rights it's entitled to, and then if there's water remaining the next most senior, and so forth down the line, and the position of the United States in the Oregon adjudication, and a position which was upheld by the Ninth Circuit in Adair, is that the tribes have a priority date earlier than that of the Klamath project. And there are questions remaining as to the quantification of that right, but when the United States presents claims on behalf of the tribe, if the United States believed that the tribes was entitled to a certain amount of water but nevertheless asserted claims for a lesser amount in order that more should be left over for the project, we would be breaching our fiduciary duty to the tribes.",
  "Again, we think that the ultimate question should be whether the Government has solicited -- in this case whether the Government has solicited input from a person technically outside the four walls of the Government based on a distinct perspective which is particularly useful to the Government, and an analogy --",
  "It's not the same sort of relationship between the Government and the water users that exists between the Government and the tribe. That is, the --",
  "Certainly we are arguing that the trust relationship is, we would say is one example of a broader principle. Another analogy would be to our representation of current and former Federal employees in Bivens suits, where the Federal employee obviously has a personal stake in the outcome of the litigation.",
  "But the attorney-client privilege would kick in only if the threshold language of interagency or intraagency were satisfied, so certainly with respect to former employees I think the necessary implication of the opponents' test is, no matter how privileged the communications were, they would nevertheless be disclosable under FOIA because they could not be characterized as interagency or intraagency documents. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As this Court stated in Armstrong versus United States, the just compensation clause was designed to bar a government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole. And petitioner's regulatory takings claim necessarily depends upon the proposition that he has been unfairly singled out to bear a disproportionate share of the burdens attendant on the provision of public benefits or the prevention of public harms. In our view the record entirely fails to bear out that assertion.",
  "No, that's correct. And certainly this Court in Lucas made clear that even when there is no exercise of eminent domain authority or physical occupation of the land there may be a taking if the burden imposed by regulatory limitations on land use has the same practical effect as a direct appropriation.",
  "I think that's incorrect. At least, in our view, the record in this case strongly supports the assertion that filling of wetlands has been a very rare practice in this part of Rhode Island. Now it's true that it wasn't until comparatively recently that statutory permit requirements were imposed as a prerequisite to the fill of wetlands. But the record doesn't suggest that extensive filling of wetlands has occurred. Now, my understanding is that even as to the dry land in this area it is only a short distance above the water table, and therefore even to construct a house on dry beach land you need fill, but it's not fill of wetlands and it doesn't have the same environmental consequences as wetlands fill. And the point we'd like to stress is that the requirements imposed most recently by the CRMP and informally by its predecessors are generally applicable limitations on the ways in which wetlands properties can be used and they secure a reciprocity of advantage to landowners in the vicinity. So it's easy to say on the one hand that the Coastal Resources Management Plan hurts Mr. Palazzolo in one sense, in that it limits the use he can make of the wetlands portion of his property, but at the same time the fact that those prohibitions are imposed on his neighbors as well tends to benefit Mr. Palazzolo insofar as his tract also includes an uplands area, because presumably the prevention of filling by neighbors preserves the quality of the environmental resources in the area, most notably Winnapaug Pond and in practical effect the restrictions function as a sort of density restriction that is --",
  "I don't think we can, Justice O'Connor and for one reason, I think --",
  "I think the short answer is that as the case comes to this Court I think the petitioner has really given up any claim that the wetlands portion of the property constitutes a separate parcel because the third question presented was --",
  "I agree that the argument has -- the point has been raised at oral argument, but the third question presented in the cert petition was --",
  "Right, merely because the property retains a value greater than zero. And the explication in the body of the petition of that third question presented made it clear that Mr. Palazzolo was not claiming the wetlands portion are a -- constitute a separate parcel and the value of that is zero. Rather the basis of the takings claim as it came to the Court in the cert petition was that the parcel as a whole had a value of only $200,000 and that that value was so small in comparison to the purported 3 million dollar figure as to amount to a total deprivation of economically beneficial use. I think even if the point hadn't been weighed, there would be strong arguments for regarding this all as a single parcel. It was bought together, it was platted together, and the State's appraiser testified, and his testimony was credited by the trier of fact, that the presence of wetland areas even if they couldn't be separately developed would enhance the value of a home constructed on the uplands area, in the sense that a house constructed on a 20-acre parcel is going to be more valuable than a house constructed on a two-acre plot, because you have open space, you have a feeling of privacy and seclusion. I think it's also important to recognize that the original investment in this property was something less than $13,000, that is -- I say something less because SGI purchased a larger parcel for $13,000 and partly in 1959 and partly in 1969 sold portions of it for prices that aren't revealed in the record. So if Mr. Palazzolo or his predecessor, SGI, put in $13,000 and now has something worth $200,000 he's hardly had anything taken from him.",
  "Well, the other point we would make about the 3 million dollar figure is, it's very important to realize exactly what the 3 million dollar figure means. Petitioner's appraiser, in arriving at the 3 million dollar figure, looked at a nearby tract, presumably on uplands, and said that lot sold for $125,000 and he said the lots that could be constructed out of wetlands are -- could be made comparable to that. And if you sold 74 of them at $125,000 each, you would come up with a figure of a little over 9 million dollars. He deducted the expenses that he thought would be incurred in actually doing the fill and came up with a net of 3 million --",
  "I agree, if Mr. Palazzolo could ever identify a point in time at which the property was worth 3 million dollars, then we would have a very different case.",
  "The point I was making is in your hypothetical the land would have actually been valued at 1 million dollars in the real world today. But if you look at the methodology that was addressed by Mr. Palazzolo's appraiser, he took as his starting point the price that was paid for a comparable lot in 1988. Now obviously that price was paid in an environment where wetlands development in this region is subject to substantial restrictions. So in effect what the appraiser was determining was, if Mr. Palazzolo could develop his property to the hilt and everybody else around him remained subject to extensive restrictions on development, his property would dramatically appreciate in value. Even if we assume that the appraiser was correct in that hypothesis, it can't form the basis of a takings claim. Mr. Palazzolo is essentially asking to have the benefit that arises as a result of the imposition of development restrictions on neighbors without accepting the same development restrictions on his own --",
  "I think at least in general our position would be that a person who takes with notice of an existing restriction on land use can't show a taking by virtue of the application of that restriction.",
  "I'm not sure that I understood the --",
  "And think that the word unfair is crucial here that there could be circumstances --",
  "I think I said ordinarily a person who takes with notice of an existing --",
  "I mean, certainly if the person could challenge it if the nature of the challenge was, this is an unreasonable regulation, it's not lawful. But if the challenge was, this is reasonable but it forces me to bear a disproportionate share of the burdens and therefore I'm entitled to be compensated, we don't think that there would be any equities --",
  "I mean, again, the purpose of the regulatory takings doctrine is to identify those situations in which an individual has been --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: We are here today not because a possibly innocent man was unjustly convicted nor are we here because he was possibly denied a constitutional right nor are we even here because he possibly was denied one of the rudimentary demands of a fair trial. We are simply here today to resolve whether or not a guilty man should escape his just punishment as a result of a technical violation of a statute. Specifically, the question presented here is whether or not Michael Bozeman is entitled to have his, was entitled to have his indictment dismissed with prejudice as a result of a one-day transfer from Federal custody into State custody for purposes of arraignment and appointment of counsel.",
  "Clearly the language, when it's read in isolation, seems to indicate that the indictment must be dismissed with prejudice --",
  "-- but the language simply can't be read in isolation. It has to be read against the background principle of harmless error, which was in existence at the time the IAD was passed.",
  "Well, there's a question whether or not the parties to the agreement can actually amend the agreement. This is not a -- this is an interstate compact involving 48 different states.",
  "They would have to go to their legislature and repeal participation.",
  "Yes, according to the act itself, it could withdraw from the whole Act itself, but to do so it would have to give up certain rights that are bestowed upon it in the Act that are very beneficial to the States in disposing of detainers.",
  "Congress could not unilaterally change the provision of the compact.",
  "Congress did do it in Section 9 of the Agreement, but when Congress passed the original Agreement in Section 7, they reserved to themselves the right to amend the agreement. Other States, specifically Alabama, do not have such a reservation clause in the Agreement, which would make it more difficult certainly to amend the Agreement. Now, there are some other States that have amended the Agreement unilaterally, but it's not been challenged whether or not that was permitted -- permissible under the Agreement itself.",
  "Well, the State adopted the Agreement partially -- certainly because of the benefits to it, but it also adopted the Agreement against the background principle that harmless errors shouldn't apply.",
  "No, Your Honor, I do not have a case where this Court has specifically held harmless error applicable where there is a specific type of remedy such as this contained within the Agreement.",
  "I do not know of a case where that has been done. However, I would say, number one, that an intentional violation act would certainly, whether or not it was intentional, would be a part of the harmless error analysis, and here I don't think there was an intentional act whatsoever. I think the prosecutor simply misread the Act and dropped the ball, and as a result Mr. -- if this Court holds that dismissal is required, then of course then the result, the purposes of this Act have not been maintained --",
  "Mr. Justice Souter, I am making the broader argument that harmless error should apply to a statute unless there's an indication of an intent contrary to it that says that harmless error should not apply, and it's my position that this statute does not indicate such an intent that harmless error should not apply.",
  "Excuse me?",
  "Normally Article IV works that you bring the prisoner over and you have 120 days within which to try him.",
  "Right.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Under the Act, that is the purposes, he's supposed to -- if you read the language in its technical, in its -- on its face, then, yes, that seems to be the only purpose which you can bring him to.",
  "That seems to be the theory, if you read it, on its face.",
  "But certainly, no --",
  "I'm sorry, I didn't understand.",
  "Absolutely. And that is why this individual was brought to Alabama, to have the appointment of counsel.",
  "Certainly.",
  "And the State of Alabama's position is, no, you don't always have to keep them there.",
  "I think that's not what it says. I think that there's enough ambiguity in the statute that is not required that you keep them there until trial.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes.",
  "Certainly.",
  "Certainly he can be brought to another State just for questioning or for other purposes, but the position of Mr. Bozeman is that under the Act you can only bring him for trial. The position of the State is that, no, there are other reasons you can bring him under detainer to Alabama.",
  "No, that's not the question that's presented today, Justice Kennedy.",
  "And certainly this Act was passed, this remedial legislation, it was passed specifically to address certain problems that occurred as a result of detainers, there being no formal procedures, and there being no way to bring an inmate into a State and have the detainers disposed of, and to do so in such a way that it didn't interfere with the rights to rehabilitation, that's the specific purposes behind this Act. Article IX of the Act specifically says that it should be construed in such a way as to effectuate those purposes, and to construe this Act as requiring dismissal of the indictment is not going to effectuate those purposes.",
  "Supposedly you could, you know, theoretically you certainly could ask for a waiver, but that is not what happened in this case, and it shouldn't be required that you ask for a waiver in order to --",
  "We could give the person the choice, but certainly again that could just simply lead to more litigation, and whether or not he understood what he was waiving and what right he had, and also we have to get him here practically in Alabama, the practical way, you have to get the person into Alabama before you can appoint counsel. There are ways to appoint counsel in advance of bringing the person to Alabama, but the practicalities --",
  "Yes, he did, Justice Stevens. Certainly that's one way that this Act could be implemented, but the State's position is that that's not required under the Act because simply the transfer did not violate --",
  "Right.",
  "And of course this Court, at the time that this case was decided and at the time we were talking about whether or not Mr. Bozeman, whether his rights had been violated by the transfer, this Court had not decided New York v. Hill and decided whether or not waiver applied to the Act, and similarly the argument made there was that because the Act said that it shall be, that if there's a violation of the 120-day provision that the Act shall be -- or the indictment shall be dismissed with prejudice, that waiver shouldn't apply because and that the Act specifically should say whether it should or shouldn't.",
  "I think there is a significance in that that case involved waiver, but it's not for the purposes of the argument that I'm making which is that the IAD was silent on whether or not waiver principles applied to it, just as it's silent as to whether or not harmless error principles apply to it. This Court held that because it was silent and because the general principle, there's a presumption that waiver applies that waiver should apply there. Similarly, I'm arguing that because harmless error is, there's a presumption that it applies to statutes as well as to constitutional errors that it should apply in this case.",
  "I don't think that every case would result in harmful error. Certainly in this case is a perfect example where there was no harm -- I'm sorry, I got that back --",
  "Certainly there are cases where there would be harm to the defendant by the transfer, for instance in Alabama there are like 2600 inmates involved in drug programs, and there's currently a waiting list of 800. Under the I -- if an inmate were transferred to another jurisdiction for a single day or maybe two days, he wouldn't lose his place in line to become involved in this program, so if he was transferred for the entire period, say, to a Federal jurisdiction to await trial, he would lose his place and lose his opportunity to participate in those programs, which could specifically prevent him from participating --",
  "I do think that there is a situation where you could bring somebody just for one day and there could be harm to them, if they weren't involved specifically, say, it was the time to take a GED, for instance, was that day, and they couldn't take it as a result, and it wouldn't be given for, you know, another year or something along that lines, it would be harm to the defendant, so there could be harm from a single day transfer.",
  "That is certainly one of the issues that is encompassed. If the Court has no further questions, I would like to save the remainder of my time for rebuttal.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a few points. I wanted to point out, the respondent has conceded that there are some exceptions to the actual wording of section, of Article IV(e), he has conceded that the language is not that clear and that there might have to be some construction of that statute in order to make it effectuate its purposes. Also, it's very important to point out that the agreement was not just for the benefit of the prisoner here, this agreement was entered into for the benefit of the party States as well as for the benefit of the prisoner, and that purpose is specifically stated in Article I, and it is one of the purposes that needs to be considered in determining whether or not a harmless error analysis should apply. In response to Justice Stevens' question about waiver and whether or not we could just have the prisoner waive, I think it's important to point out that the respondent has argued that one of the problems with implementing harmless error is it would lead to additional litigation in the trial courts, and I would point out that if we have a hearing every time we need to determine whether or not the prisoner wants to waive the right, then again we're going to have additional litigation, so either way we're going to come up with additional litigation. In answer to Justice Breyer's question about what's the purpose behind Article IV(e), I think it's simply meant to implement Article IV(c), and it's a way to bring the prisoner over, and we need to have him here, dispose of the charges, and bring him back, but I don't think the purpose is to give the prisoner some sort of benefit, some sort of way to have the charges disposed of short of a trial. Finally, Mr. Bozeman made no argument below about harm and that he suffered any harm, so it should not be considered here, and if this Court has no further questions, I thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In May 1998, respondent was convicted of a misdemeanor drug offense in a California court and was placed on 3 years' probation. One term of his probation required respondent to submit to searches of his person or property, quote, with or without a search warrant, warrant of arrest or reasonable cause by any probation officer or law enforcement officer. The acknowledgement signed by respondent stated: I have received a copy, read, and understand the above terms and conditions of probation and agree to abide by same. The Supreme Court of California has long held that such an acknowledgement is a voluntary and enforceable consent to future searches because, under California law, a defendant may not be compelled to accept probation, but may insist instead on serving the term of confinement that is authorized by law. Less than a week after respondent was placed on probation, State police came to suspect that he was involved in an act of vandalism against electric and telecommunications facilities that caused approximately $1.5 million in damage. Relying on the search condition, police searched respondent's residence and found evidence implicating him in the crime. Respondent was subsequently indicted in Federal court on charges of conspiracy to commit arson and being a felon in possession of ammunition.",
  "That's correct.",
  "By its terms, it It would have. said any probation officer or law enforcement officer. I'm not aware of any cases in the California system in which the search condition has actually been invoked by a Federal officer, but I think it would apply by its terms to such searches.",
  "It's I -- I think that's correct. unlikely that such a search would occur because presumably one of the terms of probation would be that the -- the respondent would be required to remain within the State of California, and it's -- it's unlikely that he would be searched in California by Nevada officers. But I think if -- if such an unlikely scenario unfolded --",
  "It could have That's correct. happened.",
  "The consent I think it would. would apply by its terms because it refers, without qualification, to any law enforcement officer.",
  "I mean, there might be some independent basis for objecting to the presence of the -- the officer from outside the State, but I -- I don't think that the consent would fail to extend to --",
  "Well, the -- the Supreme Court --",
  "I think the -- I think that may be right --",
  "And it might include --",
  "Well, it might -- it might include a Nevada officer, and if -- if under the circumstances Justice Stevens posits, there were actually authority for a Nevada officer to -- to be on the premises. In any event --",
  "Well, the Supreme Court of California has construed the consent to -- not to apply to searches that are conducted for purposes of harassment or in an unreasonable manner.",
  "I don't -- I don't think that No. follows. That is, the reason that California insists in many cases upon a waiver of Fourth Amendment rights as a condition of release on probation is that it wants to ensure that there will be no unnecessary barriers to monitoring the individual's compliance with the terms of his probation.",
  "Well, it wouldn't -- it would extend beyond monitoring by California, because one of the terms of probation is that the individual avoid violations of any criminal law. That is, the individual would be in violation of his probation if he violated --",
  "Certainly California has the primary interest in ensuring that California probationers comply with the terms of their probation, but -- but it would be a violation of the California probation for respondent or another probationer to violate Federal law.",
  "We're not making that argument all the way because there would be some possible --",
  "To take an example of --",
  "I think that's right.",
  "And to take an --",
  "I think the significance is that this is -- that the defining characteristic of probationers is that they have recently been convicted of criminal offenses, and the premise of the institution of probation, as the Court said in Griffin, is that a probationer is more likely than the average citizen to violate the law. And one possible way of dealing, obviously, with people who've recently been convicted of crimes is to incarcerate them to minimize the -- the likelihood that they will commit future criminal offenses.",
  "I mean, it --",
  "Well, everything stands or falls on the fact that there is a conviction. That is, it -- we think it would be the case that even if --",
  "We would say that even if there had been no agreement -- that is, even if it were the case under California law, as it is under Federal law, that an individual who has no legal right to -- that an individual has no legal right to refuse probation, even if probation were a sentence that were imposed upon the defendant without his consent -- we -- we would still argue that the search condition is a reasonable term of probation.",
  "Let me give an example of --",
  "That is almost what I'm saying, but let -- let me give an --",
  "Let me give an example of why it's --",
  "I think that's right, and let me give an example of why we're not going quite all the way and why we think you're correct. For instance, this Court held in Bell v. Wolfish, which is not cited in our brief, but it's in 441 U.S., that prison officials may preclude inmates from receiving hard cover books from persons other than booksellers or bookstores. And the rationale for that restriction was that hard cover books could be used to smuggle contraband into the institution. We think it's very unlikely that the State could impose a similar restriction on probationers because once an individual is allowed to circulate in the community, the likelihood that his receipt of hard cover books will add a meaningful increment of danger that he will possess contraband would be pretty insignificant.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Our -- That -- that is correct.",
  "I think it's correct that the State has an interest. I wouldn't quite put it as the State has an interest in supervising probation. The State has an interest in seeing to it that adequate measures are taken to ensure that a probationer doesn't violate the terms of his conditional release. And if -- if one of the dangers that the State fears, when a probationer is released into the community, is that he may commit Federal crimes as -- in addition to State crimes, it may reasonably choose to subject him, in effect, to increased monitoring by Federal officials by saying that he will have no right to demand the judicial warrant even as to searches by -- by those officials. So, we think that the -- a term of release like that is reasonably related to the purposes and conditions --",
  "We We -- we are relying on both. are saying --",
  "I mean, the agreement provides an additional check, an additional means of assurance that the conditions of probation are not unduly onerous. The fact --",
  "We would --",

  "Probation may be the only No. punishment that is actually imposed in a particular case, but we -- we certainly don't concede in this case that the individual had no choice. The individual could have insisted upon --",
  "It's -- you're -- you're correct. In the Federal system, for instance, where an individual doesn't have the choice to refuse probation, it may be that a condition of this sort would still be upheld. We would argue that it would, but it could not be on a consent theory. We would agree with you on that. And to return to Justice O'Connor's point --",
  "There -- there was a jail term. The statute provided for up to a year in prison or up to 3 years' probation, and the individual was placed on probation for a period of 3 years. And this Court has often recognized, in the context of plea bargaining --",
  "Yes.",
  "No, it couldn't have I'm sorry. insisted on the 3-year probation. That is, if the -- if the --",
  "No.",
  "In California, the No. No. individual could insist on imprisonment. He couldn't insist on probation. That is, if the judge had wanted to sentence him to prison, he couldn't have said, no, I'll take the 3-year probationary term instead. But he could insist on imprisonment and could refuse to be placed on probation. And as the Court has often recognized in the plea bargaining context, often defendants will plead guilty because they're faced with unattractive options.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, his choice -- I mean, he -- the likelihood is that as a practical matter, he will have more privacy when on probation than -- than when he is in -- than if he were in prison. As a But you're right. legal matter, he is subject to searches without any requirement of individualized --",
  "I mean, to take -- to take No. the example of -- of plea bargaining, if an individual pleads guilty to a criminal offense --",
  "But in the --",
  "But in the plea That's correct. bargaining context, if an individual pleads guilty to an offense because his understanding is he'll be sentenced to 10 years in prison and he does it because he thinks that if he goes to trial, he'll be sentenced to 20 years in prison, I mean, you could say in a sense that either way he's going to be placed in prison, so what's the choice? But the Court has recognized that to be a meaningful choice. The fact that the options are unattractive doesn't negate the volitional element.",
  "No, unless some other No. exception to the warrant requirement applied.",
  "I mean -- and, you know, to look at it that way, you could say that probation is disadvantageous because, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, it may extend for a longer period of time. The point here is not that the individual, in choosing probation, doesn't give up anything that he might have had had he chosen prison. The point is that each of the options has both attractive and unattractive features and the individual has the choice --",
  "That is, we -- No, it would not. we would still take the position that such a term was reasonable, but it would be a pure special needs case. We would not -- if the individual had no choice but to be placed on probation, there would not be a consent theory available to us.",
  "I -- I assume that you would cite Griffin, but I don't think that there is anything in our position that is inconsistent with Griffin. That is --",
  "We -- I think the That's correct. part of Griffin that is particularly helpful to us is the first part of Griffin that explained why supervision and monitoring of probationers is a State interest distinct from enforcement of the criminal law.",
  "There was no That's correct. allegation in Griffin that the individual had a right to refuse probation. And I think even in the circumstances presented in Griffin where the individual was placed on probation without his choice, the Court was careful not to suggest that the features of the constitutional -- the features of the Wisconsin scheme were necessarily constitutional prerequisites to a valid process. In particular, in footnote 2 of the Griffin opinion, the Court noted that the test for restrictions within the prison is whether they are reasonably related to a legitimate penological objective.",
  "I mean, I think -- yes, I think we would say that for the -- for the consent to be valid, the individual's waiver of rights needs to bear some reasonable relationship to the fact that he's on probation. For instance, we've said in our brief that the State presumably could not condition release on probation on an individual's agreement to refrain from criticizing the Government or to refrain from engaging in religious worship.",
  "I think that's correct, that the -- the Court has said that ordinarily even when the Government has discretion to grant or withhold a benefit entirely, it may not grant it on a relinquishment of constitutional rights that bears no reasonable relationship to the program at issue. So, because a probationer's criticism of the Government would impair no legitimate Government interests, would cause no damage distinct from any other individual's criticism of the Government, the strong inference would be that a State that imposed that condition was simply trying to stifle dissent and was attempting to use the probation condition as a hook.",
  "Right.",
  "Well, I think the consent --",
  "I mean, we have -- we have said -- I mean, I've said today that we would be here defending the condition even if it were imposed on a defendant who had no option to refuse probation. So, we would agree that the -- the existence of consent is not in our view outcome determinative. However, the -- the fact that the individual has the choice whether to accept probation or to insist on incarceration does provide an additional check, an additional assurance that the condition is not unduly onerous.",
  "I mean, there would be -- No. there would be no interest --",
  "I don't -- I don't think the -- the legitimacy of using those particular methods to attempt to solve as yet unanticipated crimes would vary depending on whether the individual is a probationer or not.",
  "I think that's probably at least, if not exactly, the --",
  "Well, you can -- you can waive the rights that are explained to you in the -- in the Miranda colloquy. That's a different thing from saying you can waive your right to be informed of -- of those rights. And to further elucidate what to us is the significance of consent, if the terms of probation under California law were much more severe -- for instance, if the probationary period were 15 years rather than 3 or if one of the conditions of probation was that an individual had video cameras mounted in his residence so he could be observed at all times -- at a certain point, you'd get to a situation where lots of probationers would decide that incarceration is better than this.",
  "I mean, he -- he doesn't under California law. That is, the California Supreme Court has interpreted the consent condition as not applying to searches conducted in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner or for purposes of harassment. And there is a statute in the California penal code governing the situations under which strip searches may be conducted.",
  "I mean, there -- there may be rare situations in which an individual's consent -- blanket consent to searches could be enforced with --",
  "I mean, certainly the -- the type of -- there -- there would have to be some justification for performing the search based on the fact that he was a probationer, but again --",
  "I mean, I think if it were for a third offense, I think yes. I think the State could legitimately make the judgment that a person who has three times been convicted of drug offenses was, for the rest of his life, meaningfully more likely to violate the criminal law than the average citizen. If you talked about another type of extreme example -- for instance, upon conviction for a traffic violation, you'll be placed on lifetime probation under which you can be searched at any time -- I think it would be probably be irrational for the State to say simply because you were convicted of a traffic violation, we will regard you 20 years down the road as being more likely than the average citizen to violate the law. But the -- the point I was making about the -- the potential terms of probation becoming more onerous, if we got to a situation where because the conditions of probation were especially harsh, large numbers of probationers decided that incarceration is better than this, then the -- an individual defendant's right to choose between the two alternatives would have obvious significance. It would provide an obvious degree of -- of comfort that the -- that what was being placed upon him, if he chose probation, was not unconstitutionally onerous.",
  "I think the consent would apply, by its terms, to that situation, and it would be constitutional.",
  "I agree that the link between the search that you describe and the -- the monitoring of compliance with the conditions of probation would be more tenuous. In this case, as you point out, the -- the search was intended to and did produce evidence of a crime that was committed after the individual was placed on probation. If I may, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "The State of California has represented in its amicus brief that the State has a little over 67,000 police officers and a little over 7,000 probation officers within the State. And in light of that fact, California has, by conditioning probation on consent to search by any probation officer or law enforcement officer -- the State has, in effect, attempted to enlist its police officers in the administration of the probation program. The core message that this -- excuse me -- that this consent term sends to police officers within the State is, if you suspect that a known probationer is in violation of the most fundamental term of his release -- namely, he's committing future crimes -- you may conduct a search that is designed to confirm or dispel that suspicion --",
  "Or -- or even you don't suspect. But -- but --",
  "I think it's probably more likely that a probation officer would conduct a truly suspicionless search, a search with no individualized suspicion whatever, than that a police officer would do so. A probation officer might decide to conduct spot checks of his charges even if there were no reason to believe that a particular individual was violating the law. A police officer would be less likely to regard that as an effective use of his resources and -- and the department's resources. But -- but the point here is that when a State police officer conducts a search intended to confirm or dispel the suspicion that a probationer is engaged in new criminal activity, he is contributing directly and precisely to the realization of a core probation purpose. I have nothing further.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Secretary of Labor has determined that an employee can derive the maximum benefit from the FMLA only if he has accurate information concerning the act, including the fact that his leave will count against his 12-week FMLA entitlement. To implement that determin --",
  "No, we don't, Your Honor. The statute itself requires that an employer post notice in such form as is directed by the Secretary. The Secretary has addressed the type of notice that must be posted for the workforce generally, but the Secretary has also determined that, although the general posting requirement is helpful, an employee who is actually on the point of taking leave for an FMLA-covered purpose needs additional information concerning the rights and responsibilities under the act, so the employer couldn't comply with the regulatory requirement simply by posting a notice for the workforce generally, and the intention here is not to penalize the employer for noncompliance with the regulation. Rather, the Secretary's determination is that a precondition to effective exercise of FMLA rights is full and complete information concerning the dictates of the act, including the fact that the leave will count against the 12-week entitlement.",
  "First, it's not --",
  "Well, first it's not clear in many cases, and it's not clear in this case, whether in fact the leave that the employer provided complied with all the requirements of the act. That is, Mr. Sutter has argued that the employer's plan doesn't contain a right to intermittent leave. Now, there's a further question of whether this particular employee could have effectively utilized the FMLA right to intermittent leave if she had known she had it, but the thrust of the --",
  "But the thrust of the Secretary's regulation is that it is better to have a bright line rule than to require the courts to engage in after-the-fact speculative inquiries regarding what might have been done months or years earlier if the requisite notice had been given and this, to the extent this is harsh, it is harsh in the same way that a statute of limitations is harsh. Clearly, when a plaintiff with a meritorious claim has his suit dismissed because he's missed the statutory limitations period by a small number of days, there's an element of unfairness there, but the justification for having a bright line rule is, first a bright line rule is likely to produce --",
  "Certainly, statutory -- statutes of limitations by definition are imposed by the legislature, but there are instances, and we've cited one in our brief, in which an administrative agency that is given authority to resolve complaints under an act may be authorized to promulgate reasonable procedural regulations to implement that directive, and that might include the requirement that a claim be filed within a certain number of days.",
  "This is on page 24 of our brief in footnote 6. We've cited Rennie v. Skerrett, which is a Seventh Circuit case that discusses predecessor versions of the current EEOC regulations which provide that Federal employees claiming discrimination under title VII must present their claims to the agency within a specified number of days.",
  "Well, first the regulation -- she was not entitled to FMLA leave at the time of her first request, but in fact the DOL regulations specifically require that if an employee requests leave for an FMLA- covered purpose but is not yet eligible for the protections of the FMLA, the employer is required to notify the employee of the time when she will become eligible, and second, at any rate, when the employee made her first request for extension of leave she had passed the 12-month period and she was eligible for the protections of the act, and it's true that in terms of the sheer number of weeks of leave that it was willing to give, the company was more generous than the act required, but the fact that an individual or a business goes beyond the requirements of the law in some respects doesn't excuse its noncompliance with other aspects of the law.",
  "Well, the intermittent leave is itself important, and again there may be a substantial question as to whether this particular employee could have made effective use of the FMLA right to intermittent leave had she known she had it, and the Secretary might, as the Eighth Circuit suggested, have adopted the regulatory approach under which that would be the dispositive inquiry, but instead the Secretary has chosen to promulgate a bright line rule.",
  "Well, in this case the statute not only gives the agency general rulemaking authority but also provides that it will be a violation of the act for an employer to interfere with or restrain an employee in her exercise of FMLA rights and, by its nature, that language presumes that there will be instances in which employer conduct is not in terms prohibited by the act, but is likely to have the practical effect of dissuading or preventing employees from effectively exercising their statutory --",
  "Well, under the NLRB, under the NLRB's approach to implementation of the NLRA, the question of whether employer conduct has interfered with or restrained the exercise of protected rights is not resolved by asking whether particular employees were, in fact, deterred from engaging in protected conduct. It's whether the employer conduct is of a nature that could reasonably be expected to have that effect, and the Secretary's determination is that failing to inform the employee that her time is being counted against the 12- week FMLA entitlement and then dismissing her while she still has the serious health condition will have the practical effect of interfering with, or is likely to have the practical effect of interfering with or restraining her exercise of protected rights. And again, the Secretary could have chosen an approach under which a more case-specific evidence would be offered as to the actual use the employee might have made of the information, but the Secretary was not required to do so, and again, this is comparable to the situation in a statute of limitations situation where, if a suit is filed --",
  "Well, the analogy to the statute of limitations is really that, if the statute of limitations has expired, we don't ask whether the defendant could have done anything differently, or whether the defendant was prejudiced by the absence of notice within the 2-year period. The -- for purposes of your hypothetical, though, the situation might also be compared to a tolling provision in a statute of limitations that says the statute will not begin to run until the potential plaintiff has received a particular item of information. If that were the situation, then the statute of limitations simply doesn't begin to run until the plaintiff knows that, and we don't ask whether the plaintiff would have done anything differently had she received the information sooner. And again, this is not intended as a penalty or even as a penalty for the employer's noncompliance with the regulatory requirement. Rather, the gist of the Secretary's determination is, in order to make effective use of FMLA rights, this sort of information is a precondition, and therefore it's a natural approach to say, until the employee has that information the 12-week period will not begin to run.",
  "May I answer?",
  "There's a separate provision in the statute that makes eligibility for FMLA benefits contingent upon having worked 1,250 hours in the preceding calendar year and, therefore, it's likely that an employee who had worked only 5 months and then had been on leave for 7 months would fail to satisfy that requirement.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The phrase, safety regulatory authority of a State, in section 14501(c)(2)(A) is most naturally read to encompass the State's traditional authority to delegate its powers to political subdivisions. That view is supported by the larger statutory context in which the phrase appears and by the purposes of the 1994 act. As Mr. Sutton has explained and as this Court has frequently recognized, one integral component of the State's ability to regulate within its borders is to delegate as much or as little power as it wishes to subordinate political units.",
  "I guess there are about three responses we would make. The first is, as Mr. Sutton points out, this is not a case in which the other provisions are identical but for the inclusion of the word political subdivision. For instance, in subsection (c)(2)(C), which is at the -- the top of A-3 of the --",
  "-- petitioners' brief, it refers to the authority of a State or a political subdivision of a State to enact or enforce a law. Now, even though delegating power to municipalities is an integral feature of the State's regulatory authority, it would certainly be less than clear that when a municipality enacted or enforced a law, pursuant to such delegation, it could not necessarily be said that the State had enacted or enforced that law. And so, if the provision left out political subdivisions and simply said that the preemption rule does not apply to the authority of a State to enact or enforce a law, there would be ambiguity, and Congress -- whether it was necessary or not, Congress might rationally choose to eliminate that potential ambiguity through an express reference to political subdivision. But the phrase that appears in subsection (2)(A) is simply safety regulatory authority of a State, and that, as you say, would most naturally be construed to encompass the authority to delegate power to municipalities. The second point is that based on the country's traditions, it would certainly be an unusual thing for Congress to interfere with the States' decisions as to the amount of power that should be delegated to subordinate political units.",
  "I believe the respondents have cited a couple of court of appeals cases which have held --",
  "None from this Court. The -- the respondents have not cited any case in which this Court has held that any Federal statute had the effect of divesting a State of its authority to delegate power to political subdivisions.",
  "We cited the Lee Deadwood case in our brief as support for the proposition that Congress would constitutionally be authorized to preempt municipal law without preempting State law if it chose. Our only point is it would be sufficiently unusual that we would expect Congress to address the matter fairly directly.",
  "We -- I think that as it's been interpreted --",
  "As it's been interpreted below, I believe the types of regulations that have been held preempted are -- are fairly similar to the City of Columbus's regulation, namely, a licensing scheme in which the vehicle is inspected, the driver is tested to ensure proficiency in the operation of the vehicle. And those have been held to be preempted on the ground that they relate to routes --",
  "I -- I think that the licensing scheme, while we would respect Ohio's decision to delegate that to municipalities, it -- in truth I think this is something that could fairly realistically be accomplished at the State level. Now, with respect to some of the other matters that are specified in (c)(2)(A), for instance, route controls based on size and weight or hazardous nature of the cargo, because the determination at issue is whether a particular vehicle or a particular cargo is suitable for a particular stretch of road, those are the sorts of things that can't realistically be expected to be done in their entirety at the State level. And therefore, it would be a particular disruption of the State's processes --",
  "The third point is that to the extent that the provision at issue here is ambiguous and the Court wants to interpret it by reference to other relevant statutory provisions, it is important to examine the larger statutory context. That is, (c)(2)(A) is not limited to safety. It specifies these other matters, and as Mr. Sutton was pointing out, the other matters are covered in detail in different provisions of title 49. In general, those other provisions of title 49 contain their own preemption provisions. They explain at -- at great length what States can and can't do. At least in the area of safety, State law is specifically defined to include the law of the local governmental unit, and so the -- the safety regime in the other parts of title 49 specifically contemplates municipal safety regulation. And it would be odd to think that Congress, in this oblique way, has superseded that carefully developed statutory framework. And to put this in larger historical context, to follow up on Mr. Sutton's point, from 1966 to 1995, at the Federal level there was division of regulatory authority between the ICC which did economic regulation and the Department of Transportation which did safety regulation. And it's no coincidence that State law as to economic matters was preempted at about the same time that the ICC saw its powers diminished and the ICC was eventually eliminated altogether. This was part of a larger program of deregulating the economics of commercial trucking. But --",
  "There -- there is no Federal agency entrusted with the administration of this particular statute. The Department of Transportation administers the related provisions of title 49 that are specifically addressed to these matters, and their implementation of their responsibilities under those provisions would be affected by this Court's decision in this case because if there is no municipal safety regulation at all, that would obviously have an impact on their administration of the scheme for determining when municipal regulation is and is not permitted. But they are not specifically entrusted with authority over this scheme. So -- so to return to the point about the division of responsibilities, Congress eliminated the ICC, eliminated Federal economic regulation of commercial trucking, and at the same time it preempted State law in order to ensure that the States didn't undo the Federal deregulatory efforts. But there's been no Federal deregulation in matters of trucking safety. The prior provisions of title 49 remain on the books. There's no expression of congressional discontent with the manner in which power in those areas has been divided between the Federal, State, and local governments. To the contrary, the conference report accompanying the 1994 act refers specifically to those preexisting provisions and expresses the intent that their administration continue unchanged.",
  "That's correct. If there are no further questions, I have nothing further.",
  "The motor carrier safety assistance program, and they also have authority under other provisions of title 49 to review and declare to be preempted State and local laws -- State and local safety laws that apply to transportation in interstate commerce. Again, those are not provisions of this particular statute. They are among the preexisting provisions of title 49 that were intended to be preserved by subsection (c)(2)(A).",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Coast Guard is the Federal agency charged with administration of the Boat Safety Act and with the promulgation of safety standards. And to understand the Coast Guard's traditional view of these issues and the backdrop against which Congress legislated, it may be helpful to look to what the Coast Guard said at the time the Boat Safety Act was proposed. And if you'll look to page 31 of the blue brief, this is the answer provided by the Commandant of the Coast Guard when he was asked, in written form, whether it was his view that compliance with Federal safety standards would furnish a complete defense to liability under common law or State law. And he was further asked, if there wouldn't be a complete defense, should that be made explicit in the act. And the Commandant said: we do not believe that compliance with promulgated standards under the act has the effect of relieving a manufacturer from liability under the usual tort law concerning negligence or warranties. For many --",
  "For many years the Coast Guard has required compliance with standards by inspected vessels. Courts have consistently held that a vessel owner's compliance with Coast Guard inspection requirements is not synonymous with seaworthiness under maritime law. Though the analogy is apparent, we would have no objection to an express provision to clarify that a manufacturer's compliance with promulgated standards does not by itself relieve him of any tort liability which otherwise could pertain. And I think the --",
  "I'm not sure whether the Commandant was a lawyer, but the -- the questions were submitted to him in written form. He was given time to consult with his advisors and prepare his answers.",
  "I think -- I think what --",
  "Well, I think a couple of things are noteworthy about the way that the Commandant responded. First, when he gave -- first, he made clear that the Coast Guard was familiar and was comfortable with the idea that even when it had inspected a vessel and had -- the -- the vessel had passed the Coast Guard's own regulatory standards, nevertheless there was a -- the possibility of damages liability based on unseaworthiness.",
  "Well, I think part of the argument on the other side has been that whatever the text of the statute might say, the Court should strain to hold common law claims --",
  "Well, first of all, the tort judgment is not identical because it fulfills an important purpose that the prescriptive standard doesn't, namely compensating people who have actually been injured by reason of defects.",
  "Well, as this Court made clear in Geier, the effect of holding that State common law suits are not categorically preempted is not that the Federal judgments can be ignored; that is, there's still a role for principles of conflict preemption. The Court in Geier said the point of the savings clause would be eviscerated if common law claims were -- that were not identical to Federal standards were categorically preempted. Nevertheless, particular common law claims can conflict with the -- the text or purposes of particular regulations.",
  "I think what he is saying is we have always understood that compliance with our regulatory requirements will not furnish a categorical defense to suits at common law and we would understand the same --",
  "That's exactly right and that's precisely the analysis that the Court went through in Geier and it's the analysis we urge the --",
  "I mean, I think the Court has often pointed out in various contexts that even where it can be said that a primary goal of Congress was X, we shouldn't assume that Congress intended to pursue that goal at all costs. The point is simply that Congress drew a somewhat different balance with respect to common law actions than it did with -- with respect to prescriptive rules. And I think part of the reason for that was that Congress was establishing a mechanism by which the Coast Guard could itself promulgate prescriptive safety standards. In ousting State law, it was replacing State law with something else. But the Boat Safety Act doesn't contain any mechanism by which an injured person can seek compensation for his injuries, and therefore it was natural for Congress to determine that subject to conflict preemption principles, the remedial mechanisms that had previously been available should continue to be available. And I think --",
  "I -- well, the -- the same could have been said of the savings clause in Geier, but the Court, nevertheless, concluded that common law actions were not categorically preempted. And I think the reason, as Ms. Brueckner said, was that no one could have supposed that common law claims going to an entirely different aspect of the manufacturer's conduct than the divine, design feature that was at issue in -- in the Coast Guard's regulatory --",
  "I think that may --",
  "That -- that might be a legitimate rule to follow in the absence of statutory language expressly addressing the subject, but here we have one provision that says a State may not establish a law requirement of setting forth a safety standard or requirement for associated equipment unless it is identical to a Federal safety standard. And then in the savings clause it says -- and this is at page App. 6 of the blue brief -- compliance with this chapter or standards, regulations, or orders prescribed under this chapter does not relieve a person from liability at common law under State law. So whatever that means, it has to mean there will be some circumstances under which the manufacturer complies with all applicable Federal rules and yet is nevertheless held liable under the common law. And --",
  "But -- but if -- if the same rule of preemption were applied to common law suits as to prescriptive regulations, namely that the State couldn't do anything that was not identical to Federal law, it could never be the case that a manufacturer who complied with Federal law could, nevertheless, be held liable at common law. The -- the preemption clause and the savings clause, read together, compel the conclusion that Congress at least intended a different rule of preemption to apply.",
  "But I -- I don't think anyone would have contended that such a suit would be preempted by the preemption clause even in the absence of the savings clause. And again, this is exactly the same situation that was before the Court in Geier. Had -- had that argument been a sound one, the Court would presumably have construed the -- the Motor Vehicle Safety Act savings clause that was at issue there --",
  "But it does refer --",
  "Well, it does refer to -- may I finish?",
  "It refers to liability under -- at common law or under State law, and therefore State law is most naturally taken to be a reference to laws that accomplish purposes similar to those of the common law.",
  "Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: As this case has been briefed in this Court, it's common ground among the parties and the United States that questions of vicarious liability under the Fair Housing Act are to be decided on the basis of generally applicable principles of agency and corporate law rather than by reference to a rule that's distinct to the FHA. And obviously, it is a -- an important general principle of corporate law.",
  "I think the Court -- I'm sorry. I think the task for the Court would to -- be to devise a uniform nationwide rule. That's what the Court said -- But certainly the Court will look as -- as in Faragher and in Ellerth, the Court looked to the Restatement of Agency which for the most part is a compilation of decisions rendered by State courts. So it's -- it's looking to the law of the States generally, but it's not looking to the law of a particular State. So with respect to our veil-piercing argument, we would say that the Court should devise a uniform Federal --",
  "We think that the claim was adequately raised in the district court.",
  "The --",
  "The -- the plaintiffs --",
  "The plaintiffs --",
  "Well, the --",
  "Well, the plaintiffs -- the plaintiffs didn't use the phrase, veil-piercing, but on page of the joint appendix, for instance, they alleged that Mr. Meyer is the designated officer/broker of Triad, the president of Triad. They also alleged that Mr. Meyer -- they alleged that Mr. Meyer was the sole shareholder of Triad. In addition, as Mr. Schwemm pointed out --",
  "And it's true that they -- they didn't allege in the complaint inadequate capitalization. However, as Mr. Schwemm pointed out, there was a colloquy in the district court in which the petitioner's counsel appeared to acknowledge that the corporation was without assets. And --",
  "I think you're right that the primary theory that the respondents advocated in the district court was based on Mr. Meyer's --",
  "Well, this -- this was raised and disputed in the Ninth Circuit; that is --",
  "Not just in the footnote. In the Ninth Circuit at page 7 and 8 of the petition appendix, the Ninth Circuit having turned to the possible liability of Mr. Meyer as the shareholder of Triad. And the Ninth Circuit said petitioner Meyer disputes that he was sued in that capacity. However, the Ninth Circuit goes on to hold, we disagree. We think that claim was adequately raised in the district court.",
  "No. But the Ninth Circuit clearly understood the claim against Meyer as shareholder to be distinct from or at least in addition to the claim against Meyer as designated officer/broker. That is, what -- what seems to us to make this a paradigmatic case for veil-piercing, taking the facts --",
  "-- in the light most favorable to the respondent, is the combination of functions that Mr. Meyer played. Now, it's true that the respondent by and large and the Ninth Circuit appeared to regard these distinct functions as separate and independent bases for liability. But in our view, it's only a short step to say even if no one of the roles that Mr. Meyer played would be an independently sufficient ground for imposing personal liability, the combination of functions, together with the inadequate -- apparent inadequate capitalization --",
  "That is correct.",
  "The -- the ultimate -- there was not a separate appeal, but the ultimate appeal that went to the Ninth Circuit was an appeal both from the dismissal of certain portions of the complaint and from the grant of summary judgment with respect to --",
  "It was not specific. The -- the appeal from the dismissal was with regard to Mr. Meyer's potential liability as shareholder and the appeal from the grant of summary judgment with regard to his potential liability as designated officer/broker was based on the grant of summary judgment.",
  "I would acknowledge that the theory that -- that we and the respondents have -- the veil-piercing theory that we have advanced in this Court is a refinement of what was said in the Ninth Circuit. But it's -- it's always been part of the case that Mr. Meyer's liability was alleged on the basis of his status as shareholder, his status as designated officer/broker, his status as president. And again, the claim in the Ninth Circuit tended -- tended to be more that these were independent bases for liability. And our view is that no one of them would be sufficient in and of itself. Taken together, they establish that Mr. Meyer exercised pervasive control over --",
  "There -- there --",
  "That -- that's correct. The district judge first threw out on 12(b)(6) everything except the claim against Mr. Meyer as designated officer/broker, and subsequently entered summary judgment for the petitioner on that claim. And then there was a final judgment and that was taken up to the Ninth Circuit.",
  "That -- that's correct. Now, in the course of doing discovery on the designated officer/broker question, they -- the plaintiffs unearthed some facts that are potentially relevant to the veil-piercing theory, but they've had no discovery on veil-piercing as such. And another important criterion in determining whether veil-piercing is appropriate is whether the individual bears some degree of personal fault for the wrong alleged. And here, the plaintiffs' allegation is that Mr. Meyer negligently supervised Mr. Crank, that that was a contributing factor in Crank's ultimate misconduct, and that would suffice to show that aspect of the veil-piercing analysis. I think it's also important to note that courts are typically more willing to pierce the veil in tort cases than in contract cases; that this Court has described the Fair Housing Act as -- as essentially defining a new type of tort. The theory is that in contract cases, an individual who contracts with a corporation has his own opportunity to assess the -- the corporation's finances and decline to do business if the corporation seems likely not to be able to satisfy its obligations whereas in a tort case the -- the potential plaintiff has no opportunity to do that. Inadequate capitalization has always been an important factor in veil-piercing analysis, and really it goes to the question whether the incorporators have adequately respected the independent status of the corporate entity.",
  "We -- we don't. That --",
  "I think it's partly that. I think it's partly just the general background rule is individual supervisors are ordinarily not vicariously liable for torts committed by the people they supervise.",
  "May I answer?",
  "If a consensus developed among the States that designated officers/brokers were sufficiently different from ordinary supervisors that they should be held vicariously liable, then we would advocate that as the general Federal rule. But the respondent has not established that there is such a consensus.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The False Claims Act is the primary mechanism for addressing deliberate efforts to cheat the Federal Government out of money and property. Petitioner has identified no legitimate ground for excluding local governments from the coverage of the act. Local governments receive very substantial amounts of Federal money, and fraud by local governments causes precisely the same harms as comparable misconduct committed by a private party. Moreover, local governments are presumptively encompassed by the term, person, and qui tam suits against local governments raise no constitutional concerns. Now, with respect to the 1863 act, to begin, it's true that as of 1863, there was no square holding of this Court to the effect that a municipal corporation would presumptively be treated as a person for purposes of Federal statutes. However, given the materials available at that time, Congress would certainly have reasonably concluded that municipalities were covered. As Justice Souter pointed out, as early as 1826, this Court quoted with approval Lord Cook's observation to the effect that the term, person, presumptively includes both municipal and private corporations and, again, because fraud by municipal corporations in the procurement of Federal --",
  "That -- that's correct. There was no square holding to that effect, but certainly all the indications in the Court's opinions would have supported Congress in its view that the term, person, would include local governments. The -- the Court in Monell held that as of 1871 a clear understanding to that effect had been established, and petitioner has identified no evidence that would suggest that the prevailing consensus changed during the years between 1863 and 1871. It -- it may also be the case that, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, the question would have been a largely academic one in 1863, because local governments wouldn't have received a significant amount of Federal money. The Congress deliberately drafted the act in a broad fashion so that it would encompass spending programs that were adopted in the future, even if they were unknown in 1863, and -- and the Court --",
  "Oh, I'm not suggesting that Congress contemplated that. I'm saying Congress wrote the statute in a way that would cover whatever spending programs came to be adopted in ensuing years, and -- and the Court addressed essentially that situation in U.S. ex rel. Marcus versus Hess, in which it said the type of financial assistance that we're dealing with here would not have been undertaken in 1863, yet Congress drafted the act broadly, and these funds are in -- as much in need of protection as other Federal money, and Congress did, in some significant, some relatively minor respects, continue to amend the False Claims Act at intervals during the period between 1863 and 1986, and during that period, it became increasingly apparent that local governments were beginning to receive enhanced shares of Federal money. It also became increasingly apparent that the term, person would be construed generally to encompass local governments, yet Congress retained the word, person, even as it amended other features of the act, and I think petitioner's primary argument is that even if the statute included municipalities up to 1986, the 1986 amendments took local governments out of the act's coverage by adding a punitive component to the damages available, and -- and this seems implausible for, essentially for two reasons. First, the whole thrust of the 1986 amendments generally was to make the act more effective, to expand its coverage, to give the Government greater weapons in fighting fraud, so it seems very unlikely that at the same time Congress would have removed from the act's coverage --",
  "That's correct. The City of Newport involved a different sort of statute. That is, the statute at issue in City of Newport was 42 U.S.C. 1983, and it provided an express cause of action, but it said nothing about the remedies that would be available, and essentially this Court's holding was, where the statutory directive is for courts to use their own best judgment as to what remedies are appropriate, punitive damages should generally not be imposed upon municipalities, but here, Congress has spoken precisely to the remedies that will be applied at the end of a successful suit.",
  "Yes.",
  "The statute does authorize the Government to intervene to take over the -- the prosecution of a case and to settle or dismiss it, and at least on occasion, the Department of Justice has intervened --",
  "That --",
  "That's correct. I -- I don't want to represent that this is done often, but it is an available --",
  "Yes. The figures I've been given by the Civil Division are that 138 qui tam suits have been filed against local governments since 1986. In 13 of those, the United States has intervened.",
  "I don't know what the disposition of those -- sometimes we might intervene to settle, sometimes we might intervene because we believe the claim is meritorious and we want to -- to prosecute the suit to its conclusion.",
  "I don't have dollar figures with respect to municipalities. I know overall since 1986 the Treasury has realized a little over $10 billion in recoveries from False Claims Act suits. That includes both qui tam suits and suits that were initiated by the United States.",
  "Well, I don't -- I don't want to represent we will do this on a regular basis. I just want to say, it is an available mechanism under the False Claims Act in extreme situations, where public policy concerns cause the Department of Justice to conclude that it's not in the public interest for the suit to go forward. The other point I would make with respect to the City of Newport is, again, if -- the City of Newport dealt with a statute that didn't specifically address the question of remedies at all. Now, if we're correct about the law as it existed before 1986, that local governments were covered, and that they were subject to the double damages remedy that this Court had held to be essentially remedial, if Congress had wanted to exclude municipalities from the act's coverage, it -- it really seems outlandish to think that Congress would have attempted to achieve that objective by leaving the word, person, in the act unchanged, and by amending the act's liability provisions. If Congress had believed that it was appropriate either to take the municipalities out of the scope of the act altogether, or at least to subject them to remedies less than those available against private corporations, the natural thing to do would have been to amend the act so to provide. It -- it seems unlikely that Congress would have attempted to achieve that objective by so indirect a means. The other point we would make is that there may be isolated situations in which an award of treble damages under the act will far exceed the harm that was done to the United States, but the alternative that petitioner contends we believe is much worse, because it would leave the act entirely unavailable for redressing all manner of fraud committed by local governments against the United States. When we have a contract action, when we have an ordinary suit of a dispute about money, and we regard it as a good faith controversy, even if we prevail at the end of the day, it's often the case that the United States won't be made completely whole, because we incur costs of investigation, costs of prosecuting the suit, we may lose the time value of money. When we're dealing with good faith disputes, Congress and the executive branch have been content to treat that undercompensation simply as a cost of doing business.",
  "I -- I don't know that any do. It certainly would not be the norm. I mean, the -- the American rule is that each party bears its -- its own attorney's fees, and so absent some express statutory authority, we would not be able to recover our fees, even if we prevailed, and so again, Congress is willing --",
  "I don't think with -- certainly as to municipalities I think we would have a hard time, without express statutory authority, arriving at a contractual agreement that municipalities would be subject to such an unusual remedy and, as I say, Congress and the executive branch are willing to live with that form of undercompensation when we're dealing with a good faith dispute. The False Claims Act is reserved for that narrow category of cases that involve people who don't simply ask for money that, in fact, they're not entitled to, but who ask for it knowing they're not entitled to it, and Congress reasonably concluded that different remedies were necessary to address efforts to defraud and cheat the Federal Government.",
  "There -- a false statement is one category. There -- there is a knowing requirement. That is, the individual entity has to knowingly submit a false claim. There -- there are instances in which the claim may be false even if it doesn't contain an express false statement. For instance, if it's very clear that it's necessary, for instance, that medical services be medically necessary in order to be reimbursable, and the --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In a section 5 preclearance action, the appropriate comparison is between a covered jurisdiction's proposed voting change and the jurisdiction's existing practice. In the present case, the district court found that Georgia's proposed Senate districting plan was likely to cause a significant diminution of black voters' ability to elect their candidates of choice.",
  "The Justice Department --",
  "The Justice Department's view is that the analysis should focus on the plan as a whole, and our guidance is --",
  "We do look at the plan as a whole.",
  "No, because our -- our feeling was that there were three Senate districts that we focused on specifically because we felt, for a variety of reasons, that the diminution in black population was likely to have a significant impact on black voters' ability to elect candidates of choice in those three districts. And we -- we also looked to where those black voters were going. Were they being redistributed to other districts in which they would increase the ability to elect candidates of choice? The -- the focus of the inquiry has always been on the ability to elect candidates of choice. So, for instance, if --",
  "Several points. The -- the Court- in the second Bossier Parish case discussed the retrogression standard and grounded it in the word abridge and explained that the -- the word abridge necessarily implies a comparison to some baseline. And in the section 2 context, the baseline is a hypothetical reasonable world. But because section 5 is targeted specifically at voting changes, the appropriate baseline is the jurisdiction's existing practice.",
  "No, because I think the likelihood of --",
  "I mean, I think -- I think the --",
  "Well, I -- I think one -- one thing the Court should focus on is that when we're talking about the Senate districts at issue here, we are talking about districts that are among the strongest for blacks in the State of Georgia; that is, under the benchmark plan, 13 out of 56 districts with -- Senate districts within the State had majority black voting age populations. That's in a State that's approximately 27 percent black in terms of voting age population. So to say that the districts in which blacks are strongest have been reduced to a point where blacks have an equal opportunity to elect candidates is not equivalent to saying that in the State as a whole blacks have equal electoral opportunities.",
  "I mean, I think if we're going from the 90 percent certainty to the 51 percent likelihood --",
  "-- we would still say that's retrogression. We -- we do have a sort of substantiality inquiry in Department of Justice preclearance practice where --",
  "I -- I think part of the reason --",
  "Part of the reason that the Government challenged these three districts had to do with the magnitude of the increase, but part of it also had to do with electoral history and evidence of racially polarized voting. And I -- I don't --",
  "I -- I don't know the reason that we didn't object to -- to Senate District 15. I do know as to Senate District 2, for instance, that even though the BVAP under the benchmark plan was over 60 percent, in a 1999 runoff election, the black candidate of choice had won the -- the primary by only 70 votes, and the reason was that the black candidate received approximately 78 percent of the black vote but only 9 percent of the white vote, and then --",
  "No.",
  "We certainly think that they do, and -- and nothing that we've said in this case and nothing that the district court said is to the contrary. That is, if the State had sought to prove that the likelihood of electing black voters' candidates of choice in these three districts would be somewhat reduced, but that that was likely to be offset by corresponding increases in the ability to elect -- to elect candidates of choice in other districts --",
  "I don't -- there was -- there was a pair of Senate Districts, not 2, 12, and 26, one of which was reduced sharply in black population --",
  "No. That -- that's not the case at all. I think the -- the nature of the State's plan was to reduce the high majorities of black voters in some districts, and those voters would be redistributed to other districts, but not districts in which there would be a high enough black population to create a plausible likelihood of electing black candidates of choice.",
  "As -- as an original matter, I think an argument could be made that black voters throughout the State of Georgia would be better off if every district were 27 percent black on the theory that even though they couldn't elect any candidates of choice, they could influence all legislators. But although an argument could be made along those lines, the Court has consistently, in its vote dilution cases, framed the inquiry in terms of the ability to elect -- to elect candidates of choice.",
  "I -- I agree that the -- the precise question hasn't come before this Court. The two things I'd say are that, first, we are talking about the strongest districts for blacks. So to say that those districts have been reduced to an even shot, a toss-up, is not to say that blacks have equal electoral power statewide. The second point I'd make is this is not different in principle from what goes on all the time in other preclearance settings. That is, it is often the case that a covered jurisdiction will seek preclearance of a voting change, and the change will consist of getting rid of something that the jurisdiction had no obligation to create in the first instance. But the inquiry has always focused on retrogression, on whether the State has made black voters worse off than they were --",
  "I -- I think you're looking at it correctly. And when the Justice Department approached this case, there were other Senate districts in which the absolute drop in black voting age population was much greater than in these three districts. The reason we found these districts problematic was partly the -- the magnitude of the reduction, partly the fact that it had occurred along a point in the spectrum where a 10 percent reduction was especially likely to have a concrete impact. That is, it stands to reason that reducing black population from 60 percent to 50 percent will more likely affect concrete results than reducing it from 80 percent to 70 percent or from 20 percent to 10 percent.",
  "And --",
  "That's correct. And we -- we introduced --",
  "We introduced --",
  "We introduced substantial district-specific evidence of racial polarization in these three specific Senate districts. We -- both statistical and anecdotal evidence to the effect that there was a high degree of correlation between the race of the voter and the candidate of choice and evidence that racial appeals had been made in prior elections within those districts. So the first step was to say, based on all that evidence, there is a -- this change is likely to have a significant impact on black voters' ability to elect candidates of choice in these districts. And the district court found to that effect. And the second thing that the district court said --",
  "That's correct. His -- his analysis of the statistical evidence of prior elections within the districts was that there would be minimal white crossover voting. There was substantial racial polarization within these three districts specifically. And so the district court found that the likelihood of black candidates -- of black voters' ability being able to elect candidates of choice in these three districts --",
  "I -- I don't believe that there were findings to that effect. The -- the findings were basically surveying the last --",
  "During the last few years. Basically the experience under the benchmark district. But the second thing that the district court said and -- and emphasized -- and I believe it's on pages 133 and 134a of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement. The district court said at the very bottom of the page, once again we note that it may well be the case that any decrease in African American electoral power in Senate Districts 2, 12, and 26 will be offset by gains in other districts, but plaintiff, namely the State, has failed to present any such evidence. So the district court acknowledged in principle that even though black voters' ability to elect candidates of choice in these three districts had been substantially decreased, the State might, nevertheless, be able to prove non-retrogression for the plan as a whole if it presented evidence that there would be offsetting gains in other districts. And the court faulted the State for a failure of proof not for any -- not -- it didn't suggest that there was a -- an analytical barrier to proceeding along that basis. So I think the district court regarded this as a relatively easy case precisely because there were meaningful losses in identified districts and no attempt to prove offsetting gains in others. And again, the retrogression standard has always focused on whether the change renders minority voters worse off. And again, the -- the preclearance inquiry would substantially -- be substantially complicated if the analysis were otherwise. That is the Court has held, for instance, that relocation of polling places is one type of change that has to be precleared before it can --",
  "The -- the gravamen of the -- the testimony was not that there would be offsetting gains in black voters' ability to elect candidates of choice. Really, the thrust of the plan was black voters would be taken out of majority black districts and placed in districts that were predominantly white. The black percentages would be too low for the black electorate to elect candidates of choice, but it might be high enough that the black vote could swing the balance between a white Republican and a white Democratic candidate. That was really the thrust of the plan. And because -- again, whatever might have been said in the first instance, the Court's analysis has focused on ability to elect candidates of choice. Congress has amended section 2 to facilitate vote dilution claims along those lines. Congress has continued to reenact section 5 against the backdrop of the Court's decision. So even though the argument could have been made that it's more important for blacks to be the balance of power in a lot of districts than to be able to elect candidates of choice in a few, the Court has rejected that proposition and Congress appears to have endorsed the Court's holdings by continuing to reenact these provisions without change. If the Court has nothing further.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin by discussing the distinction as we see it between the terms adverse effect and actual damages. And as one of Justice Scalia's questions indicate, the term adverse effect is not one that originated in the Privacy Act. It's - it's a term of art. The general judicial review provision of the Administrative Procedure Act grants a right of action to persons adversely affected or aggrieved, and I don't think it's the case that a plaintiff under the APA needs to show that he has suffered the type of harm that would ordinarily be compensable in damages. Because the APA excludes money damages as an available item of relief, the typical inquiry in - under the APA in determining whether a plaintiff has standing is whether he is likely to suffer harm in the future, not whether he has been harmed in the past. And if we had a hypothetical APA suit, for instance, challenging an ongoing or imminent program by which the Government intended to release Social Security numbers, and a particular plaintiff could show there is a likelihood that my own Social Security number will be released in the near future, I think that would be sufficient in and of itself to establish that that person was adversely affected or aggrieved within the meaning of the act. He would be suffering a - a violation of his legal right to have information about him maintained within the Government's files and he would also suffer at least an increased risk of identity theft. That would be enough to get him into the - into court to seek prospective, injunctive, or declaratory relief. But those certainly wouldn't be the types of harms that would ordinarily be compensable in damages.",
  "He wins -",
  "He - he wins but -",
  "But -",
  "But the fact that a plaintiff can win under the APA and, in our view, can't win under the damages provision of the Privacy Act simply reflects what is implicit in the APA's exclusion of money damages as an available item of relief, namely the view that agency action should ordinarily be reviewable in court, and plaintiffs who can show that they would be injured by unlawful government conduct in the future should ordinarily be able to get a judicial order decreeing that that not take place. But plaintiffs are not ordinarily entitled to receive money damages from the Government for wrongs committed against them.",
  "That - that's right.",
  "That the damages provisions restricts the availability of monetary relief to a person entitled to recovery, and the phrase, person entitled to recovery, is most naturally construed to mean someone who has not only established a violation of law, but who has established the prerequisites to an award of compensatory relief.",
  "One - one hypothesis as to why the phrase may appear as it does. The phrase originated in the Senate version of the legislation, and the Senate version said that a plaintiff who establishes a will - an intentional or willful violation can collect actual or general damages, but a person entitled to recovery shall receive no less than $1,000. And so, in the context of that provision, the phrase, person entitled to recovery, could be a shorthand for person entitled to recover either actual or general damages.",
  "But that -",
  "I mean, I think - I think -",
  "I mean, the more - I think the more natural reading is that a person entitled to recovery is someone who not only has established some of the prerequisites to an actual recovery, namely a compensatory award, but who has established all of them. And if the only compensatory relief available is actual damages, then a person who hasn't established actual damages is not entitled to recovery. But even if a plausible argument could be made the other way, then the canon of construction that waivers of sovereign immunity are to be construed narrowly would compel the Court to read it in - in the narrow way.",
  "That - that's -",
  "Or - or -",
  "That's correct. If - if Congress had intended that any plaintiff who established an adverse effect from a willful or intentional violation would automatically receive at least $1,000, it could have used the word person or individual or complainant, which was - which were the words that Congress used elsewhere in the Privacy Act to describe the individual whose rights had arguably been violated.",
  "Exactly.",
  "And the other point I would - we would make in following up on one of Justice -",
  "I mean, I think - I think we have to infer that Congress or presume that Congress meant something by the choice of words that it used. And the phrase entitled to recovery is -",
  "A benign fiction, that's right. And I think it is also the case that the phrase, person entitled to recovery, is used very rarely in the United States Code. There are a number of provisions along the lines of actual damages or $1,000, whichever is greater, references to statutory damages or liquidated damages. But the phrase, person entitled to recovery, is very rare and we would presume that Congress intended something specific -",
  "The petitioner is correct that the phrase intentional or willful has been construed by the lower courts essentially as a term of art, and the prevailing test in the lower courts is whether the agency exhibited flagrant disregard for -",
  "I - I think, with respect to the - the language from the court of appeals' opinion that you quoted, the without grounds to believe that -",
  "Right. I - I think what the courts are getting at is something at least akin to the standard that would prevail in a Bivens action, where an individual Federal officer was sued, where the question would be, could a reasonable officer in this person's position have believed that what he was doing was legal? Probably the courts have applied it in a - in a manner that's slightly more deferential to the Government. In - in - it doesn't mean, however, that the Government has to have been shown either to have intentionally violated the law or to have intentionally sought to bring about harm to the plaintiff.",
  "No, no, I don't think you need to decide that.",
  "That - that's correct.",
  "As the case comes to this Court, both parties are in agreement, or neither party contests the proposition that an intentional or willful violation was established.",
  "I - I would candidly acknowledge we have not had a problem with enormous recoveries against the Government up to this point.",
  "That - that was -",
  "That was ultimately dismissed on the ground that the Social Security numbers were not records, which is contrary to the general course of the law, which is that Social Security numbers would be - be records. I - I want to be careful about this because we are not arguing that exorbitant liability would inevitably follow from a loss in this case. What we are saying is, if we lose this issue and if the word adverse effect is given the same meaning in the Privacy Act that it has in the APA, the Government would be subject to enormous potential liability. To take an example, following up on one of Justice Breyer's questions, as - as you pointed out, the Privacy Act is not limited to a prohibition on unlawful disclosures. It contains a range of other provisions that could be best be described as technical or even bureaucratic. One, for instance, is that when the Government collects information from private individuals, it has to identify, among other things, the source of authority, either a U.S. Code provision or an executive order that authorizes the information to be collected. And if an agency circulated 100,000 forms and left off the U.S. Code cite, I think, under ordinary APA standards, any person who returned information on that form would be - would suffer an adverse effect, because he would have been deprived of -",
  "I mean -",
  "It would be rare.",
  "Well, you could - you could imagine a situation, and we wouldn't condone this - this conduct, but you can imagine a situation in which an agency official gets back the 100,000 forms from the printer and says, oh my gosh, the U.S. Code cite was left off, but then decides, I know we're supposed to do this, but I'm not going to reprint 100,000 forms for something like that, let's circulate them. We don't condone that behavior. It would be a violation of law, but it's hard to imagine that Congress would have intended that everybody who fills out information on those forms would then be entitled to $1,000.",
  "Yes.",
  "Not - not as to Buck Doe. The - the magistrate judge held that each of the plaintiffs had established an adverse effect simply by release of the Social Security numbers, and the district court didn't expressly endorse that view, but didn't reject it either.",
  "You - you wouldn't have to decide whether there was proof of actual damages, but yes, I think if it was apparent on the complaint that there was an adverse effect but no possibility of proving actual damages, then the suit shouldn't be - shouldn't go forward, but -",
  "I - I agree, but I think it would be -",
  "I agree, and it may be that to - Congress anticipated that questions concerning damages would be resolved at the end of the day, and there would obviously be a lot of cases in which a plaintiff would allege damages at the outset, and therefore, would have a cause of action, but if he failed to prove damages in the - the course of the trial, he wouldn't be entitled to the $1,000, even if he proved that he suffered an adverse effect from a willful or intentional violation.",
  "We would say that equitable relief is not, in this context, is not specifically authorized by the Privacy Act. But we would say that equitable relief would be available under the APA, and the allegation would be that the -",
  "- agency's action was not in accordance with law -",
  "- because it violated the Privacy Act.",
  "So - so - and indeed, this suit at the outset included a request for injunctive relief against further disclosures, and the Government settled that part of the case with lightning speed. There was - the - the plaintiff did obtain a judicial order directing the Government not to continue with its practice.",
  "That's correct.",
  "No, I think we are contesting that.",
  "No, no. We - we are contesting that and -",
  "It hasn't really been -",
  "Yes, and let me backtrack for a second to say that the Fourth Circuit decided that Mr. Doe had not proved actual damages, and the petitioner did not seek this Court's review of that holding, so -",
  "That - that's right. There was -",
  "That - that's correct. My - my only point was, the reason we haven't briefed the question of whether there were in fact actual damages is that our understanding is that, because petitioner didn't seek this Court's review of that aspect of the - the court of appeals' holding, as the case comes to the Court, we're assuming that there were no actual damages.",
  "But - but to answer your - your question about what the Government's position on the law is, our - our first argument is that in the context of this specific statute, the phrase actual damages refers only to pecuniary harm, and we've cited in a footnote a conflict among the circuits with respect to that question, and that - that isn't presented by this case.",
  "But we would -",
  "I mean, there - there would be a question of whether that was - whether there was causation, whether that was a reasonable response to the threat, but in theory, an expense like that could qualify as pecuniary harm and, thus, is actual damages.",
  "I mean, I agree that it's a somewhat anomalous result that the availability of the thousand can turn on a relatively small pecuniary loss. It's - it's somewhat analogous at least to the common law rule that punitive damages are available only to a plaintiff who's shown some level of compensatory damages, and there also a plaintiff might be able to contrive a small loss that is compensable, and thereby make himself eligible for punitive damages that far exceed the amount of -",
  "I mean, we would still want to - we would still have to know whether that was in fact a reasonable response to what the Government had did - done - and what the - the threat that it posed to the - the plaintiff. And even if that kind of machination might be possible in in one category of cases, it would still not be possible in a lot of other categories of potential - of Privacy Act violations. To continue with my answer to Justice Souter's question, the - the second thing we would say about the emotional injury is that, even if some emotional harms were compensable as actual damages under the statute, we don't think that the particular emotional harm alleged here would be, because a Social Security number, unlike, for instance, intimate details about a person's family life, is not inherently private or secret or confidential. It's not the sort of information that would cause a person to say, I would be horrified to think that somebody else knew that even if I could be sure that that person wasn't going to misuse it against me. The - the reason that people are worried about release of Social Security numbers is that that release may lead to some further, more tangible harm, identify theft or -",
  "That -",
  "That's correct. And we've cited the Metro-North case in our brief, and I think that the harm - the emotional harm that he's alleged is really - really very similar to the fear of cancer as a result of asbestos exposure that was held not to be compensable in the absence of some current physical impairment. So to - to - follow up on this and make our position absolutely clear, we are saying that if the term adverse effect is given its usual meaning, and every plaintiff who establishes an adverse effect from a willful or intentional violation is entitled to $1,000, that the potential financial consequences would be enormous. Now, I would say in all candor that if we lose this case, it's quite possible that the Government would argue in the lower courts that to protect the public fisc, the - the phrase adverse effect should be given a narrower construction under this statute than under the APA. But our basic point is -",
  "There are a lot of statutes with wording, for instance, to the effect of a plaintiff who establishes a violation will receive actual damages or $1,000, whichever is greater. Most of those don't apply to suits against the United States -",
  "- but there are many such laws.",
  "That's correct. Under the plain terms of the statute, the plaintiff would get the 1,000 -",
  "I'm - part of it may be that most of those statutes are not dealing with suits against the United States, and Congress may be more protective of the public fisc, and part of it is the - the legislative debates reveal that Congress considered a variety of potential damages provisions, some of which were more generous than the one that was ultimately enacted, some of them less generous. For instance, the more generous provisions -",
  "It's not quite unique. I believe there are a couple of other provisions that use the phrase, person entitled to recovery, and that phrase has not been authoritatively construed by this Court, so those - interpretation of those statutes would raise the same question this one does.",
  "And - and sometimes, again, the words are to the effect of actual damages or $1,000, whichever is greater. And because the availability of the $1,000 is not limited to a, quote, person entitled to recovery, unquote, the plain language of many of those statutes compels the conclusion that $1,000 will be awardable regardless of actual damages.",
  "I mean, I think the more - I think you're right that the more natural reading - the OMB guideline didn't address in terms the situation where a plaintiff shows no actual damages but nevertheless claims the thousand, but the OMB guideline did say, a person who suffers an adverse effect from a willful or an intention violation shall receive a 1,000 - actual damages or $1,000, whichever is greater.",
  "I mean, I think if - if plaintiffs are using the OMB interpretation to establish the point that intelligent people can read the statute the way that they did, I - I think it's validly used for that purpose. But the OMB guideline is not entitled to deference, as the Court held in Adams Fruit, a statutory provision that is to administered solely by the courts is not one as to which the Court will defer to administrative interpretations. The - the OMB -",
  "Congress designated OMB, but it's - the particular provision that is at - specifically at issue is reprinted at page 13a to the appendix to the Government's brief. And it says, the director of the Office of Management and Budget shall develop and, after notice and opportunity for public comment, prescribe guidelines and regulations for the use of agencies in implementing the provisions of this section. So the only specific directive that OMB had was to instruct or direct agencies as to their substantive obligations under the act. Now, in the course of doing that, it was entirely appropriate for OMB to go further and offer its view to the agencies as to what consequences would follow if they breached their substantive obligations, but that wasn't a task that was specifically entrusted to OMB by statute, so I don't think there's any basis for inferring that Congress -",
  "Exactly.",
  "Exactly.",
  "So the - the last - the last point I wanted to make is, it might be possible, if - if we lost this case, it might be possible to mitigate the financial consequences to the Government by giving the term adverse effect a narrow construction, but our - our view is, if the consequence of adopting plaintiff's reading of the phrase person entitled to recovery is that an established term of art like adverse effect has to be construed in other than its normal manner in order to make the statute make sense, there's something wrong with plaintiff's reading.",
  "Right.",
  "I mean, I guess if - if this - if this Court held that the phrase intentional or willful was limited to situations -",
  "If it - if it was limited to situations in which the Government set out to violate an individual's rights under the Privacy Act, that - that would be another way at least of -",
  "I - I mean -",
  "I mean, even under the narrowest possible interpretation of what intentional or willful means, you could have hypotheticals like the one with the form that left off the U.S.C. cite, and again, we - we hope those things would happen very rarely, but it seems highly unlikely that Congress would have wanted each of the hundred thousand people who put on - information on the form to get $1,000. Thank you.",
  "I'm sorry, Justice Scalia. I - are you referring to the language that's in (g)(2) and (g)(3) of the statute?",
  "(g)(2) and (g)(3) are entirely different causes of actions. Those deal with requests for injunctive relief, and this is the only type of injunctive relief under the Privacy Act, injunctive relief for access to files or correction of files. Those are separate causes of action. In fact, I submit, Justice Scalia -",
  "- that the contrast in the language between (g)(2) and (g)(3) -",
  "- and (g)(4) proves my point. Here, Congress anticipated that there is a substantial - substantially prevailing party. That party -",
  "I - I submit that a perfectly proper interpretation of intentional or willful can include conscious disregard of - of the - of the legal obligations. That's a well-established standard. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The plea colloquy conducted at respondent's 1996 prosecution adequately informed respondent of the dangers and disadvantages of proceeding without counsel. Respondent's waiver of counsel and the guilty plea itself were therefore knowing and intelligent. The judgment of the Iowa Supreme Court should be reversed. I think it may be helpful to look first at the precise language that the Iowa Supreme Court employed in announcing the warnings that it thought were constitutionally required, and if the Court looks at page 18 of the appendix to the certiorari petition, that's the paragraph of the Iowa Supreme Court's opinion that's entitled Summary and Disposition. And it --",
  "Of the appendix to the certiorari petition. And if you -- if you look in -- in the middle of the page, the Iowa Supreme Court in summarizing its holding said, rather, the trial judge need only advise the defendant generally that there are defenses to criminal charges that may not be known by lay persons and that the danger in waiving of the assistance of counsel in deciding whether to plead guilty is the risk that a viable defense will be overlooked. The defendant should be admonished that by waiving his right to an attorney, he will lose the opportunity to obtain an -- an opinion on whether under the facts and applicable law it is wise to plead guilty. In addition, the court must ensure the defendant understands the nature of the charges against him and the range of allowable punishments. But the third paragraph is -- is more -- the third sentence is more or less irrelevant because there's no dispute here that the defendant was informed of the nature and -- of the charge and the applicable punishments, and that would be done in any standard plea colloquy. So it's really just the previous two sentences that are at issue, and I think there are some noteworthy points about these. The first is that the warnings mandated by the Iowa Supreme Court don't contain any declarative sentence to the effect that you have a right to represented by counsel at this plea proceeding. The Iowa Supreme Court I think took it as given that respondent had been made adequately aware that he had a right to counsel and that what was missing was adequate information about the services that counsel could perform in connection with the plea decision. The second thing is that there's no reference in these warnings to case-specific issues such as possible suppression of evidence or the potential for plea bargaining. The -- the warnings are designed to be warnings that could be given in every single case. And in our view, the warnings are either vacuous or misleading, depending on how they're interpreted. If they are accurately interpreted as generalizations about the criminal justice process, they really say nothing more than that as a class lawyers know more about the law than people who are not lawyers, and it's at least possible that consulting with a lawyer would improve your chances in this criminal prosecution. And I think any defendant who is aware that he has the right to counsel would be aware of those facts, would be aware of at least the possibility that a lawyer could help him and the certainty that a lawyer would know more about the charges than he would. On the other hand, if the defendant misunderstands these warnings as directed to him personally as availed suggestion that there is actually a meritorious defense in his own case, then the defendant may be given an artificial disincentive to plead guilty and in the case of a non-indigent defendant may be led to spend his own funds consulting with a lawyer when in fact no valid defense exists.",
  "I think it would be constitutionally sufficient, but it's certainly better practice to make sure that the defendant understands that the right extends beyond the questioning itself. And I think that was done in the initial appearance. The defendant -- there's -- there's a form. The defendant is represented as having waived his right to application for appointed counsel. I suppose that still leaves open the possibility that he could have retained counsel if he had chosen to. But I think that certainly apprised the defendant of the right -- of -- of the fact that his right to counsel extended beyond the initial questioning itself and would continue for the duration of the proceedings. And we'd also point out that because this is a collateral challenge, the defendant bears the burden of establishing that no knowing and intelligent waiver occurred. And to the extent that there's a gap in the record on this point, I think the defendant is properly chargeable with that. I'd also like to return to the point that Justice Kennedy made earlier about the possibility that in some cases an attorney might be able to obtain suppression of incriminating evidence or might be able to negotiate with the prosecution about possible plea bargains. I think first it's noteworthy that the standard rule 11 colloquy mentions several constitutional rights that an individual gives up by pleading guilty, but it doesn't mention the possibility of suppressing evidence and it doesn't mention the possibility of plea bargaining. So it would be odd to think that you could have a constitutionally valid waiver even though the defendant was not informed of those substantive possibilities but would, nevertheless, have to be informed of the assistance that a lawyer might provide in connection with those --",
  "Well, as to the -- it does -- Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 in its current form says that if the defendant appears at the plea hearing without counsel, he is to be informed that he has a right to counsel at trial and at every other stage of the proceedings. So there's clearly a requirement that the defendant be made aware that he has a right to counsel at the plea hearing. Neither the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure nor the bench book for U.S. district judges requires that the defendant be given additional information about the services that an attorney might provide or the likelihood that an attorney could be helpful by --",
  "My sense is that there is probably a great deal of variation not only from State to State, but among different courts within different States I think, and I think that's probably the -- the likelihood in the Federal system as well.",
  "I don't think we would assume that any -- necessarily any layperson would be aware of the potential for suppressing evidence or the possibility of negotiating a plea arrangement. I think any defendant knows more generally that lawyers have legal expertise that lay people lack. But I think if -- if we try to -- to think about how warnings about suppression and plea bargaining might work, I think we realize why the Iowa Supreme Court shied away from something like that because, on the one hand, if this Court instructed, as a matter of constitutional law, that whenever an uncounseled person pleads guilty, he has to be informed that in some cases it may be possible to suppress incriminating evidence and in some cases it may be possible to negotiate with the prosecution for a reduced charge, a lot of defendants are going to be given false hope because the possibility that those modes of procedure might succeed would vary enormously.",
  "Well, I -- I think those rules really do focus on things that will actually happen in any criminal trial if the defendant decides not to plead guilty. That is, the defendant is informed if you plead guilty, you are waiving the right either to testify or not testify on your own behalf. You're giving up the right to counsel. You're giving up the right to cross-examine witnesses. The defendant really is being told about things that are likely to occur in virtually any criminal trial, and I think that's -- that's the idea of a standardized plea colloquy. On -- on the other hand, if you're talking about suppression of evidence or talking about plea bargaining, if you give that advice in every case, it's often going to be misleading. A trial judge is going to find himself in the position of saying you might be able to bargain with the prosecution over a reduced charge even though he knows that the policy of the prosecutor is not to engage in plea bargaining with respect to a category of cases that includes that one.",
  "No, I don't think there would be any Federal law barrier to States requiring warnings such as these. And I -- I think the -- the vacuous warnings, the warnings we regard as vacuous, that were mandated by the Iowa Supreme Court are less likely to be harmful than more specific warnings about -- But the other point I wanted to make is if the Court decided that it wouldn't be a good idea to warn about suppression of evidence or plea bargaining in every case but maybe it would be advisable to do that in some cases, that would really be thrusting trial judges in an untenable position because the point of having a standardized plea colloquy is to give judges a -- a safe harbor, to give them some assurance that if they provide standardized advice in every case, that's going to be enough. And if a trial judge had to decide is the likelihood of a successful plea negotiation sufficiently great in this particular case that the defendant should be advised about it or do I see a viable basis for asking for suppression of evidence, it would really make the trial judge's life much more difficult. And if the Court were to hold, as a matter of constitutional law, that the trial judge is required to do that and can be reversed for failure to, it would really cause disruption.",
  "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I would like to address, first, the City's argument that the long passage of time renders it improper to give the tribe a tax exemption on lands that have recently been purchased. That argument is wrong for three reasons. First, if we are correct that the tribe had federally protected title as of the 1790s and that that Federal protection was never validly extinguished, then the fact that the tribe was out of possession of the relevant lands for nearly two centuries is, itself, a distinct and substantial legal wrong, and it would be adding insult to injury to say that precisely because the tribe had suffered that initial injury, it should be disentitled to take advantage of a tax exemption that would otherwise flow from its possession of --",
  "Well, I think it -- I think it's important to distinguish between two different types of delay. What was at issue in Oneida I and Oneida II was delay in bringing the underlying lawsuit. And, even in that context, the Court said that the suit was not barred entirely, but equitable factors might be taken into account in formulating an appropriate remedy. Here, we don't have delay in filing a lawsuit. That is, nobody doubts that the tribes asserted their right to a tax exemption promptly after repurchasing the relevant lands. The argument on the other side is that their delay in purchasing the land should be analogized to --",
  "This Court has held that the tribe - - that a tribe may abandon aboriginal title to land.",
  "It's not - -",
  "But the Court has also held that once Congress creates a reservation, once it confers explicit federal protection on particular lands, the reservation can be diminished or disestablished only by act of Congress; it can't be terminated through adverse possession. And with respect to the question of whether delay in buying the land should be analogized to delay in bringing a --",
  "I think the -- the reservation would remain a reservation. As Mr. Smith pointed out, with respect to parcels within the reservation that are not owned by Indians, the tribe's regulatory authority is extremely limited and, therefore, the tribe would not be able to exercise anything like plenary regulatory jurisdiction over the whole 270,000 acres.",
  "The Court, in Atkinson Trading and in Montana versus United States, before that, had said that the tribe may be able to regulate conduct on non-Indian lands to the extent that the conduct involves voluntary transactions with the tribe or its members or to the extent that the regulation is necessary in order to protect the tribe's sovereign over the land that it possesses is - -",
  "I agree. In -- and Atkinson Trading makes clear that, even when the great bulk of the land is owned by the tribe or its members, the tribe's ability to regulate conduct on the non-Indian parcels is sharply limited. That would be doubly true in a tract of this nature. But to return to the point about the State's reliance interest, I think it's -- or the city's reliance interest -- I think it's important to stress that this case is only about taxation, and a municipality can't claim to have the same sort of reliance interest in being able to tax that a potential defendant in a --",
  "That's true, but - -",
  "Congress does have the power to deal with it. And at the end of the Court's opinion in Oneida II, the Court expressed confidence that, up to this point, has not been borne out, that Congress would fix the problem.",
  "Well, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has recognized the tribe all along. That is, under the Treaty of Canandaigua, the Federal Government was required to pay annuities and treaty cloth to the Six Nations, and the Federal Government has done that continuously since the beginning. So we've always recognized this to be a tribe. And I think you're -- you've put your finger on an important point, Justice Breyer, in that the Court, in Oneida II, said that it hoped that Congress would fix the problem, and thought that it would, but said even if Congress doesn't legislate a solution, the suit can go forward. The Court contemplated that equitable considerations could be taken into account in formulating a remedy, but it certainly didn't contemplate that the tribe, at the end of the day, would be left without any remedy at all. And, as you point out, if the tribe can sue for damages, it seems farfetched to think that it wouldn't be able to reassert the tax immunity that - -",
  "No, the Court has said -- the Court has said, as a general matter, as a matter of Federal law, a tribal merchant on tribal land can be required to collect sales taxes from non-Indians, at least for the purchase of goods that were manufactured off the reservation.",
  "I mean, taxes are at issue -- are the only thing that's at issue in this case. But I agree that holding this parcel to be a reservation would have implications for regulatory jurisdiction, as well. Now, there isn't a categorical rule of Federal law that says that States and localities absolutely cannot regulate conduct on tribal lands within the reservation. Rather, there is a preemption test - - there's certainly a thumb on the scale in favor of an exemption from state and local regulation where tribal reservation lands are involved.",
  "Well, the Court, in the New York Indians II, recognized, to start with, that the treaty effected an immediate session of the Oneida's Wisconsin lands to the Federal Government, and the Court specifically noted that that cession, in and of itself, would be sufficient consideration to support a contract between private parties. So it simply isn't correct to say that the New York Oneidas gave up nothing other than a promise to remove. The second --",
  "I mean, there were references to the primary inducement to the Federal Government's entering into the treaty being the desire to - -",
  "No. No.",
  "The compensation was strictly for the Kansas lands that were denied to them. And it's important to note that the Senecas --",
  "They got -- I mean, they didn't - - they weren't held to have promised -- made a commitment to remove from New York. Now, clearly, in analyzing the reasons --",
  "That's correct.",
  "It rested, in part, upon the cession in Wisconsin. It rested, in part, on a fairly technical argument, to the effect that the grant of Kansas lands was one en presente. That is, it was a present grant of Kansas lands, and, therefore, the New York Indians could be disentitled to those lands only if they had -- a forfeiture had been established. And the Court looked to Article 3 of the treaty to determine the conditions for forfeiture. It said that the Federal Government would have been required to allege a forfeiture by legislative or judicial act, et cetera. The other thing I really wanted to -- the point I wanted to make about the reliance interest of the taxing jurisdiction are that no matter how long a particular tract has been taxable, it is -- may I finish this? -- it is always within the realm of a city's contemplation that it may be bought up tomorrow by the Federal Government, a church, any other tax-exempt entity, and, consequently, the municipality can have no sense of repose that it will remain taxable. Thank you.",
  "Justice O'Connor, may it please the Court: The issue in this case is the content of this Court's regulatory takings doctrine and, in particular, whether that doctrine includes the inquiries called for by the substantially advances test, which this Court articulated in Agins, but which is grounded in principles the Court has long recognized both before and after Agins.",
  "The --",

And then the Court said, but the seemingly absolute protection of the Just Compensation Clause in the context of a -- of a regulation that affects that kind of appropriation, as opposed to an outright condemnation of it, that that protection is subject to an implied limitation that exists to allow the government to serve its purposes, as Pennsylvania Coal described it, if the government could hardly function at all, if it were required to pay for every interference with property rights occasioned by its regulation. So what we have growing out of Pennsylvania Coal is a -- a rationale for allowing the government to interfere with private property rights that would otherwise be protected and otherwise could not be taken without compensation in order that the government may serve its legitimate purposes.",
  "I think it goes to the difference, Your Honor, between the public use standard and the -- which governs in a situation in which the government is paying compensation. And in that standard, as we've been discussing today, in that context, the Court has applied a very deferential standard because the -- the burden on property rights is lesser and the -- the impediment --",
  "-- to governmental action is greater.",
  "We -- we believe, Your Honor, that it is a compensation issue.",
  "We wanted a declaration from the court that the -- that they cannot proceed with a statute that takes our rents without paying -- paying for us. What's happened here is that this legislature has enacted --",
  "Yes. The statute does not authorize payment.",
  "Yes, Your Honor.",
  "What we are arguing about here is compensation, and the standard that we --",
  "Yes.",
  "Your Honor, the -- in Lucas, this Court found that a -- a complete deprivation of the economic value of property constitutes a categorical taking. But the Court has not held -- it did not hold in Lucas and it has not otherwise held -- that a regulation that affects less than a complete destruction of economic value is categorically not a taking. The point of the Court's regulatory takings doctrine and the inquiries that it mandates is to determine those circumstances in which a deprivation that is less than a complete destruction of economic value require compensation.",
  "And my answer to that, Your Honor, is that it goes -- it stems from the rationale expressed in Pennsylvania Coal for allowing the government to interfere with private property --",
  "Well, part of the question whether the regulation goes too far is whether there is a basis for imposing the burden on a particular property right. Here we have --",
  "Well, I think, Your Honor, that the -- growing out of Pennsylvania Coal, the Court has recognized that one of the critical factors, if not the most critical factor, in regulatory takings analysis is the character of the government's action and the nature of the government's interest. It's not simply a matter of how much property has been taken. The question is the government's basis for taking that property. When we -- what we have here, Justice Breyer, is a -- is a -- a right specifically protected by the Constitution. The Constitution provides that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. And Justice Holmes in Pennsylvania Coal was -- said that that seemingly absolute protection is qualified, and the --",
  "Compensation, of course, has to be paid.",
  "Your Honor, I -- to me there's a threshold question of whether a general building regulation of that type really would be a -- a regulation that would implicate the Takings Clause at all.",
  "Yes, Your Honor, I do. And because the -- the -- assuming -- on the assumption that this is really a -- a burden on property rights that would be subject to the Takings Clause, then that burden requires compensation unless there's some limitation on the compensation principle. And the limitation that the Court has recognized, growing out of Pennsylvania Coal, is the need for the government to function. So we have an inquiry into whether this furthers the governmental purposes. Now, in your example, Your Honor, I don't think there's any question that that inquiry would be satisfied. Our point is simply that the inquiry must be made.",
  "Yes, and --",
  "The compensation would be measured as the difference between the -- the rent that was allowed under the regulation or the statute and the rent that the -- that the landlord, the lessor, would otherwise be entitled to collect in the marketplace.",
  "No, that is not our position, Your Honor. The -- the -- and in fact, the -- the State has specifically disclaimed any contention that -- that this is like the typical residential rent control. So --",
  "And our --",
  "Your Honor, our -- the question would be, under our analysis, is not the validity of the -- of the ends, of the legislative ends. That would be taken care of in the inquiry under public use. So -- so the -- so the question of the legitimacy of the government's interest in controlling rent would not be at issue. What would be at issue under our test is the connection between the -- the rent control, the burden on private -- private property rights that's imposed and the nature of the asserted interests and the degree to which that burden furthers that interest. Now, in the typical residential rent control circumstance, where the purpose of the statute -- where -- where the -- where the legislature is concerned about the -- the price, the rent -- the rental amount that residents are having to pay, in that circumstance, the test that we're proposing would be easily met because the purpose of the statute would be to grant rent relief to the -- to the tenants. And that --",
  "I think our --",
  "Well, I think our position, Your Honor, is that there are -- this -- this is a threshold inquiry, the -- the hypothetical --",
  "I think that it would pass the inquiry. I suppose you could -- you could --",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "You would have an inquiry into whether there is a categorical taking under Lucas because it deprived essentially all economic value of the property and you would inquire under Penn Central whether -- because the threshold inquiry into the nature of the government's interest is satisfied, you then inquire into whether the burden is such in light of the purposes to be served that we believe it goes too far --",
  "I mean -- part of my answer to that, Your Honor, is that this test, in our view, does have very narrow application, which is the reason why we don't believe that the State is correct in suggesting that it will result in the invalidation of all kinds of economic regulation. Having said that, though, I do believe that it is an important threshold requirement that should be met, and if the government has not identified a basis for singling out a given property right and imposing on that the burden of a regulation and if it has not demonstrated that the burden it is imposing is related in a -- in a -- in advancing the purpose for which the burden is being imposed, then in that circumstance, the -- the rationale for imposing that burden without compensation, in contravention of the compensation requirement in the Fifth Amendment, is missing.",
  "And I -- the distinction we're relying upon there, Your Honor, is -- is the question whether the government can proceed with compensation as distinct from proceeding without compensation. When the government proceeds with compensation -- it's going to pay for the private property rights, the constitutionally protected private property rights, with which it's interfering -- then we demand a lesser showing. But when there is a constitutional right at stake, the -- the showing should be higher. We're not asking whether the government can proceed at all. We're simply asking whether the government can proceed without compensation. And the without compensation is what triggers and infringes upon the very rights that are protected by the Just Compensation Clause.",
  "Your Honor, I -- the -- the question of whether it makes sense turns upon the standard of review that the Court is going to apply to answer that question. And when we are --",
  "Because of the -- the -- the difference in the relative interests at stake when we're talking about proceeding with compensation as against without compensation. In -- in the -- it's similar to the other protections extended under the Bill of Rights. The Court has indicated that the Just Compensation Clause is just as much a part of the Bill of Rights as any of the other protections of the Bill of Rights. And there are circumstances in which the government may proceed. There would be a rational basis for it to proceed under a very deferential standard that would be applied under the Due Process Clause, but the Court, nonetheless, requires a higher showing because of the intrusion on constitutionally protected rights.",
  "Your Honor, the State's position in this case is that by preserving a network of lessee dealers, there will be benefits to the public in terms of lower gasoline prices. And I think their -- their theory is that those benefits would far outweigh the -- the modest decrease in rent, lost rent to the oil companies. And so that it -- it would make sense if the government wished to make that choice and -- and to pay compensation, if the government's theory were correct. And one of the values of the Just Compensation Clause and the constitutional rights that it protects is that it forces that choice to be made. It -- it puts the decision on budget as opposed to off budget.",
  "In fact, we believe that is -- is, in essence, what is occurring here. There -- there is no claim that the rents that Chevron or the other oil companies were charging are excessive or that they have been the cause of any problem in the State of Hawaii that Hawaii is trying to address.",
  "Let me see if I can get to it better, Your Honor. One reading of the Takings Clause, the Just Compensation Clause, would be that the government should pay compensation in those circumstances where it is depriving property owners of protected property rights. But in Pennsylvania Coal, the Court said in the regulatory takings area, because of the need for the government to function, we are going to allow the government in certain circumstances to -- to interfere with rights without paying for them. And the inquiry that we're saying the Court should make is whether that need exists and whether the burden being imposed serves that need. And -- and again, I'd like to emphasize that this should not be considered an unfamiliar concept in constitutional law. This Court has consistently recognized that when the government seeks to intrude on protected -- rights protected by explicit provisions in the Constitution, on the basis that its needs, its legitimate interests require that intrusion, then the court's role to enforce the constitutional protections is to make that inquiry into whether the need is -- is being actually served. Now, I'd like to at -- at this point emphasize that our position is not that no deference may be given to legislative judgments under this test. Our position is simply that it must be more than a mere rational basis test. The reason why the Court, in repudiating the Lochner-era cases, has held that mere rationality is enough to satisfy the constitutional standard is that there was no specific constitutional prohibition. In the -- and -- and the Court specifically distinguished those circumstances in which there is a constitutional right --",
  "I think, Your Honor, that most courts have recognized, although I don't know that it's settled, that a -- a control on the price of a product that -- that a business has produced would implicate the Takings Clause. And -- and in that circumstance, the substantially advances test almost certainly would be met, and our --",
  "Yes. The Florida Power case v. the FCC where there was a regulation on the prices that telecommunications companies could charge for access to their poles. Back in the war era, there was cases involving rent control where the Court found that the rent control was justified because there was a market distortion caused by the extraordinary imbalance in --",
  "I believe they were, Your Honor, and that they have been -- that this Court has discussed them in those terms. But I would like to, if I could, address the broader point that I believe Your Honor was -- was making, which is can these claims just simply be repackaged and -- and sweep into the takings analysis all of the regulation and apply to it the very same test that the Court has repudiated in Lochner. And the answer to that I believe is clearly no. The -- the Just Compensation Clause is limited to rights of private property, would not extend -- and I don't believe there's anything in this Court's precedents that would require it that it extend to the kinds of laws, minimum wage laws, wage and hour provisions, regulations on the size of bread loaves, that were the professional licensing requirements that were the subject of the Lochner-era cases. And the Due Process Clause extends even to expectancy interests or -- or reliance interests on governmental benefit programs. Nothing in our position here would -- would apply to that because those, we don't believe, have ever been held and -- and should not be held to be covered within the specific provision of the Just Compensation Clause. Your Honors, in Nollan and Dolan and First English, this Court recognized that the Just Compensation Clause is not a poor relation among the provisions of the Bill of Rights. In First English, the Court recognized that the constitutional provisions by their very nature limit the freedom and flexibility of the government in order to protect constitutional rights. And the Court in First English said that the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment is one such provision. And our position here is that this constitutional right, that private property shall not be taken without just compensation, should be entitled to the same protection as the other constitutional protections in the Bill of Rights, and that just as with respect to those rights, when the government seeks to intrude on those interests, the court should properly inquire into the nature of that intrusion and the justification for that intrusion. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States as amicus curiae supports the State in American Trucking and the petitioner in Mid-Con. With respect to American Trucking, in our view the central question in resolving the constitutional issue is not whether it would be possible to apportion the intrastate fee on a more precise basis. The question is whether the Constitution requires it. And in the prior cases that we've cited in our brief, both the older cases dealing specifically with intrastate transportation and the more recent cases dealing with authority to engage in other intrastate businesses, this Court has repeatedly upheld the authority of States and municipalities to charge flat fees for the privilege of engaging in the local business within the jurisdiction during the -- the relevant period of time. And that practice --",
  "Well, with -- with respect, Your Honor, I think the Court has certainly abandoned the notion that there is a bright, absolute line between intrastate activities which are subject to plenary regulation by the States without any Commerce Clause inquiry and interstate commerce which is wholly immune from State regulation. The Court has recognized that the question is more complicated than that. But in cases like Jefferson Lines, for instance, the Court held that the sales price of a ticket for an interstate bus trip could be taxed in -- in its entirety by the State in which the ticket was purchased because the sale of the ticket was regarded as a separate, discrete event properly severable from the underlying interstate transaction. And the case for severance is all the more powerful here. That is, here we're dealing not with a - - an aspect of an interstate transaction, we're dealing with point-to-point hauls within the State of Michigan. It's true that those may be undertaken by trucks that also do interstate business, and it's even true that in some instances the intrastate load may be carried on the same truck at the same time that it's also carrying goods between the States. But the intrastate haul is itself a discrete commercial transaction. To the shipper it's wholly irrelevant, in most instances, that the -- the truck is also doing an interstate business. And to differentiate this case from Scheiner, one of the things that the Court has looked at in the dormant Commerce Clause inquiry is the risk of multiple taxation. And the Court doesn't just mean multiple taxation in -- in the abstract because it's necessarily going to be the case that an entity that does business in many States will be taxed in many States. Rather the question is whether there's an undue risk of multiple taxation on the same transaction or the same conduct or the same activity. And that was at real risk in Scheiner because if you imagine a truck that's delivering cargo from Maine to Florida and passing through several States on the way, and it's required to pay a fee that is, in essence, a fee for entering the State, has nothing to do with the mileage traveled within the jurisdiction, it's entirely reasonable to say that the imposition of those cumulative trips - - cumulative taxes for a single haul of goods from Maine to Florida is an instance of multiple taxation of the same event. Here we don't have a problem with that. The tax is being levied solely on point-to-point hauls within the State of Michigan. If a particular truck also makes point-to-point hauls in some other State within the calendar year, it may be subject to two taxes, but they can't be characterized as two taxes on the same conduct or the same transaction. The second aspect of -- of Scheiner --",
  "I mean, I think you're right that it wouldn't be reasonable to regard the within-Texas segment or the within-Oklahoma segment of a transfer of goods between States as a discrete, separable event. But if the truck is picking up goods at one point in Texas and depositing them at another point in Texas, again from the shipper's point of view, that's clearly a discrete transaction. The shipper is unlikely to have any interest in whether the same truck is simultaneously carrying goods among the States. And it's reasonable to regard that as a discrete event that is taxable by the State in which it occurs. The other point to make about Scheiner is that even if we assume, as the petitioner argues, that the average interstate truck that makes some point-to-point hauls within Michigan will do so less frequently than the average truck that does business solely within that State, there's still a whole different class of interstate truckers that makes substantial use of Michigan's roads that could be charged taxes on the basis of mileage traveled and they're being let off the hook because the State has chosen to focus this tax on intrastate activity. Petitioners' response to this is that you can't discriminate against one class and then make up for it by -- by discriminating in favor of a different class. And if this were, to use title VII terminology, a disparate treatment case, we would agree. That is, if a State overtly discriminates against one class of interstate or out-of-state activities and on the face of the law those people are treated less favorably, then we would entirely agree that the State couldn't make up for it by giving more favorable treatment to a different class of out-of-state entities. But here the petitioner is making what amounts to a disparate impact claim, and the essence of a disparate impact claim is not that any particular individual has suffered unfair treatment. The way you prove a disparate impact claim is to show the effect cumulatively upon the class, upon interstate truckers in this case in the aggregate. And there's really no way to feel any kind of confidence that interstate truckers won't do better as a group by virtue of Michigan's decision to focus this tax on intrastate activity rather than on the basis of mileage, which would sweep in a lot of out-of - state truckers that are not currently covered. I'd like to speak briefly at least about the - - the Mid-Con case. And in our view the best way of understanding -- to -- to return to the historical antecedents of the current SSRS provision, in its original form, as enacted in 1965, the statute said it's not an unreasonable burden of -- on interstate commerce to require an interstate carrier to register its Federal certificate so along as you do so in accordance with the standards of the ICC. If you go beyond those standards, it's an unreasonable burden on commerce.",
  "That was - -",
  "The text of the current statute is set forth at page 82 of the appendix to the certiorari petition in Mid-Con, and it's now 49 U.S.C. 14504(b). And the statute says, the first sentence, the requirement of a State that a motor carrier providing transportation subject to jurisdiction under subchapter 1 of chapter 135 -- and that refers to interstate transportation - - providing interstate transportation and providing transportation in that State must register with the State is not an unreasonable burden on transportation referred to in section 13501.",
  "No. 13501 is the provision that -- that defines the general regulatory jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation and the Surface Transportation Board. And it basically says these agencies have general regulatory jurisdiction over transportation between points in one State and points in another State and -- or between points in the same State passing through another State. So in -- in using that shorthand reference, the Congress just means interstate transportation.",
  "Well, as long as the -- again, to -- in our view the distinctive and disqualifying feature of the current statute is that subsection (2) is imposed specifically on vehicles that operate entirely in interstate commerce. And if Michigan reduced to $90 the extra - -",
  "As long as - -",
  "As long as they were still imposing that additional -- again - -",
  "As long as that $90 fee was imposed not just on Michigan-plated vehicles generally, but specifically on Michigan-plated vehicles that operate entirely in interstate commerce, we would say that's preempted because our reading of the statute is that basically Congress has said there's a severe limit on what you can do to interstate carriers that you don't do to intrastate carriers.",
  "May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?",
  "The State doesn't argue that this registration was completed in accordance with this standard. It argues that the provision doesn't apply at all because this is not the sort of registration requirement that the statute speaks of. We think it is because it's imposed strictly on interstate carriers.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It's a well established principle of Federal appellate practice that the litigant must adequately preserve a claim in the trial court in order to raise it on appeal. The disputed issue in this case is whether a claim of insufficient evidence is adequately preserved for appeal through the filing of a pre-verdict Rule 50(a) motion or whether a renewed post-verdict motion under Rule 50(b) must be filed, as well. The text of Rule 50, the practical considerations that underlie contemporaneous objection rules, and this Court's decisions construing Rule 50 all indicate that a post-verdict motion is necessary for adequate preservation of the claim.",
  "It often is. It can be made -­",
  "I think that's a very typical practice.",
  "It doesn't -- it doesn't have to be made at the close of the plaintiff case, but it can be made at any time after the opposing party has had an adequate opportunity to be heard. And so -­",
  "It is requesting the same sort of --",
  "-- relief, but it -- different considerations would affect the trial judge's decision whether to grant the motion. And I think -- in a sense, this goes to Justice Kennedy's question -- that is, one of the reasons that, at least with respect to the motion that's filed at the conclusion of all the evidence, that these motions are almost uniformly not granted, the case is almost always submitted to the jury, because the thought is, very little is lost by submitting the case to the jury, because the suit has been tried already, and there may be substantial gains in efficiency from pursuing that course. I think if a motion was made at the conclusion of the plaintiff's case, and the judge thought it clearly had merit and thought that a substantial savings in cost and time would ensue from granting the motion, the trial judge could take that into account in deciding whether the motion should be granted or not. But I think -- I think it's important to look at the text of Rule 50. And it's reprinted, among other places, at page 57(a) of the appendix to the certiorari petition. And in -- at the beginning of Rule 50(a)(1), it says, \"If, during a trial by jury, a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, the Court may determine the issue against that party.\" Again, the word \"may\" is permissive. So, while the judge may take into account potential savings in time and expense, the judge is never required to grant a Rule 50(a) motion, even if the judge is firmly persuaded that the evidence on the other side is insufficient. And then, at the very bottom of the page, the first sentence of Rule 50(b) says, \"If, for any reason, the Court does not grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of all the evidence, the Court is considered to have submitted the action to the jury, subject to the Court's later deciding the legal questions raised by the motion.\" And the significance of that sentence is that it says, \"No matter what stated rationale the District Court gives\" -- whether the District Court simply says, \"I'm reserving the motion,\" or says, \"I'm denying it, because the evidence is, in my view, clearly sufficient\" -- \"whatever stated rationale the Court gives, the action will be treated as a reservation of the legal questions.\" And I think one of the reasons that it would be inappropriate to allow appeal of a sufficiency claim without a renewed post-verdict motion is that in order to attain reversal on appeal, regardless of whether the remedy is entry of judgment or a new trial, the Court of Appeals has to be able to point to an erroneous ruling by the District Court. And the reservation of a ruling on the 50(a) motion, by its nature, can't be erroneous. That is, the judge is specifically authorized to submit the case to the jury -­",
  "We don't believe that that's the case. That is, at this point, the rule has been amended so that the time for filing a post-verdict motion is 10 days after entry of judgment, rather than 10 days after verdict, as it used to be. But this Court said, in Johnson, that, in the absence of a renewed verdict post- -- a renewed motion post-verdict, neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals may order entry of judgment in the favor of the verdict loser. And I think that the text of Rule 50(b) bears that out. If you look farther down that paragraph, on page 58(a), the rule says, \"Submission of the case to the jury is to be treated -- or considered to be a reservation of the legal question.\" And then it said, \"The movant may renew the request.\" And then that sentence says, \"In ruling on a renewed motion, the Court may, if a verdict was returned, allow the judgment to stand or grant a new trial or order entry of judgment.\" And I think that phrase, \"in ruling on a new -- renewed motion,\" is significant, because the only express authority that the District Court has, post- verdict, to grant judgment as a matter of law is that the court may do so in ruling on a renewed motion. The rule doesn't contemplate a situation -­",
  "That's correct. And the judge could do that, either pre- or post-verdict. That is, pre- verdict, the judge could say, \"I think your motion may very well have merit, but, in the interest of overall efficiency, I'm going to submit the case to the jury. But, in the event that the jury comes back against you, I would encourage you to renew that motion.\" There's nothing wrong with the judge encouraging the litigant to file something like that, or signaling that the judge has doubts about the sufficiency of the evidence. But the rule makes the renewed post-verdict motion a prerequisite to entry of judgment as a matter of law, post-verdict. And it -­",
  "He should. And, indeed, this Court, in -- as early as Montgomery Ward, have said that was the better practice, and that requirement has since been codified in what is now Rule 50(c), which says that if the Court grants the motion for judgment as -- the renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, and there is also an alternative motion for a new trial, the judge should rule on that, as well, and should basically say, \"In the event that my ruling on the JNOV -- or the JMOL\" --",
  "Yes, \"shall.\"",
  "So, \"In the event that my ruling on the sufficiency question is reversed on appeal, the Court of Appeals will know how I would have ruled on the new-trial motion, and the processing of the case can be expedited.\"",
  "That's correct.",
  "That's correct. But the Court -- this Court, in Montgomery Ward, noted that there may be inefficiencies if the District Court rules on the JNOV motion, but doesn't rule on the conditional motion for new trial, because if the JNOV -- if the ruling on the JNOV motion is reversed on appeal, then there's a need for remand for further proceedings, and it's inefficient. But to return to the point about taking an appeal from a Rule 50(a) motion, I think it would put a District Court in an untenable position to say, \"You can reserve ruling on the 50(a) motion, even if you think the evidence is insufficient,\" and, indeed, it's usually the better practice to do so, but, if you do that, and the jury comes back against the movant, the movant can take an immediate appeal, and you can be reversed on the ground that your ruling on the Rule 50(a) motion was erroneous. There's simply no -- by its -- by the terms of the rule itself, the submission of the case to the jury, in the face of a Rule 50(a) motion, is considered to be a reservation of the sufficiency question.",
  "I mean, conceivably you could have read the rule that way at the time of Johnson, but first we have this Court's decision in Johnson, which says the submission of a post-verdict Rule 50(b) motion is an essential prerequisite even for the District Court to act on the motion. And, therefore, if the motion is not renewed, the District Court is entitled to treat it as abandoned. And, second, the rule, in its current form, limits the authority of the District Court to enter a judgment as a matter of law post-verdict to the situation where the court is ruling on a renewed motion. The rule doesn't contemplate a situation in which the motion is not renewed and yet the District Court purports to rule on the 50(a) motion that was left hanging by the submission of the case to the jury.",
  "I think we would say, for some of the same reasons that Mr. Bailey has identified, that plain-error review would be inappropriate, because in order to have plain error, there has to be error. And if the gravamen of the appeal is that denial of the pre- verdict Rule 50(a) motion was plain error, it can't be right, because the pre-verdict -- the submission of the case to the jury is treated, as a matter of law, as a reservation of the legal questions, and it can't be plain error to reserve those questions for later decisions.",
  "That's correct. That was -- that was the fact in Johnson, that the District Court expressly reserved its ruling, and the court, nevertheless, held renewal as essential.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Although Congress has not clearly expressed an intent to foreclose all judicial review of petitioner’s constitutional claim, such review should be conducted in a manner that is as consistent as possible with the text and structure of the CSRA. Because petitioner failed to invoke the grievance procedures of the applicable collective bargaining agreement, his suit was properly dismissed. And if I may, just in a -- a moment or two, summarize the Government’s position as to the steps that an individual in petitioner’s position would have to take in order to obtain judicial review of a constitutional claim like this one. efforts to utilize the available administrative remedies under the CSRA itself, including any instance, the first two steps of the grievance process, talking to the immediate supervisor and then to the facility manager, would have been within petitioner’s control. And if those steps had proven unavailing, petitioner should have requested that the union take the case to arbitration, and then, if necessary, to the FLRA. Second, if at the end of the administrative process an avenue of judicial review is available under the CSRA itself, the employee must seek relief pursuant to that provision. And I think petitioner really concedes that point to be true; that is, if petitioner were raising a constitutional challenge to a major adverse action, such as dismissal, petitioner concedes not only that he would have been required to exhaust administrative remedies by -- by appealing to the Merit Systems Protection Board, but petitioner also concedes that we -- he would have had to seek judicial review in the manner specified by the CSRA, that is, by filing a petition for review of the MSPB’s decision in the district court. And finally, our position is that if at the review is unavailable under the CSRA, the employee may then obtain review of his constitutional challenge alone in district court, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure -- Procedure Act. Now, in some sense, there is an element of untidiness in our position because what we’re trying to do is reconcile Congress’ intent to adopt --",
  "There would have been, at least for this employee, by virtue of the fact that he was covered by a collective bargaining agreement.",
  "Yes.",
  "If -- if he requests that the FLRA and the union refuses, our position would be that he could then file suit in Federal district court under the Administrative Procedure Act on his constitutional challenge alone. That is, we think on the one --",
  "That would be in the district court --",
  "That is if the union does not agree to take the case to arbitration and then to the FLRA. If --",
  "I think -- on the Government’s waiver of sovereign immunity for nonmonetary claims. but it’s not one of timing alone. That is, our position is if Mr. Whitman had been successful in prevailing upon the union to take the case to arbitration and then to the FLRA, the position we’ve taken in the brief is that judicial review, if the FLRA had rendered an unfavorable decision, would most appropriately be accomplished in the court of appeals pursuant to the CSRA. But our position is if the union is unwilling to take the grievance to the point where the ruling can be reviewed under the provisions of the CSRA itself, that the APA remains available as a fallback. But the -- the fact that it’s one of timing doesn’t make it an insignificant difference. That is --",
  "I mean, first, certainly if Congress had said with absolute clarity that district court review of claims like this is precluded, we would defend the statute as constitutional. Second, I agree with you that the fairest reading, the most likely interpretation of Congress’ intent is that claims of this nature -- that is, complaints about aspects of the employment relationship that don’t rise to the level of personnel actions. The fairest reading of Congress’ intent is that such suits would be precluded. decisions has required something more than that before inferring that Congress has barred all judicial review",
  "I mean, in some sense the CSRA --",
  "But I -- I think the flip side of it is that some of those cases involved statutes that appeared on their face to function as express preclusions of judicial review. Here, we don’t have that. Here, the argument as to why Administrative Procedure Act review is precluded is not based on the text of any CSRA provision standing alone. It’s based --",
  "I think the Court had the same situation in Webster v. Doe. That is, in Webster v. Doe, the Court concluded that given the limits on review of the CIA director’s employment decisions and given the great sensitivity of hiring and firing matters within that agency, the Court concluded that there was simply no law to apply in review of the -- the claimant’s complaint under the Administrative Procedure Act. Nevertheless, the Court concluded that judicial review of the constitutional challenge remained available. And the idea was not so much that Congress itself had manifested an intent to differentiate between the two types of claims. It was that Congress had treated the two types of claims the same but that the type of evidence that will suffice to eliminate judicial review of a non-constitutional claim is -- require before eliminating judicial review of a constitutional claim. under your explanation of how the system works, you go to district court with a constitutional claim. He’s -- he -- the district court doesn’t have to reach the statutory claim first?",
  "No. The statutory claim wouldn’t be before the district court. Again, if -- if the --",
  "I -- I agree that it’s an unusual system, but I think it -- and in a sense the same situation would have been present in Webster v. Doe, that is, the Court, when it came to review the merits of the constitutional challenge, wouldn’t have had any possibility of deciding the case on a non- constitutional basis because non-constitutional challenges would be foreclosed. Now --",
  "Yes.",
  "There’s no private right of action conferred by 45-108 itself. Now, in the ordinary case, when a Federal statute places limits on agency personnel and a particular category of plaintiffs falls within the zone of interest that was intended to be protected by that provision, then even if the statute that limits agency discretion itself doesn’t provide a private right of action, the Administrative Procedure Act would entitle a claimant to get into court and argue that the agency’s decision was contrary to law, namely the relevant statute. So if there were no question of CSRA conclusion, we would agree that the claimant could go into court raising a statutory challenge notwithstanding the absence of a private right of action in 45-108 itself. Here, we think that the evidence from the comprehensive congressional scheme is sufficient to claim. We don’t think that Congress has spoken with the clarity that this Court has required to divest the challenge.",
  "No. We’re saying that he first has to attempt to persuade the union to seek arbitration. That is, he has to make all reasonable efforts to utilize the full range of administrative remedies. But it -- our -- our position is if the union declines that request, then judicial review would be available at the end of the day in Federal district court.",
  "We didn’t characterize it as an exhaustion argument. That is, the district court dismissing the suit. However, we -- this is not a case in which we have, up to this point, litigated the switched to a threshold objection to adjudication. We’ve always argued that the suit was barred by the CSRA scheme, and we’ve always pointed out that the petitioner did not take advantage of the administrative remedies that were available to him. Really, the only change in our position is that we have been in the -- in this Court have been willing to acknowledge that in the hypothetical case where someone in petitioner’s position did make -- take full advantage or make reasonable efforts to take full advantage of the administrative processes, that judicial review would be available.",
  "I -- I mean, again with the caveat they would first have to avail themselves of the administrative --",
  "I mean, I think you’re -- you’re correct that you could do that in the general",
  "No. In -- in our view, in harmonizing the -- the principle that judicial review --",

  "That’s correct.",
  "Well, certainly to -- I mean, that is, justifiably to impose an exhaustion requirement, the Court would have to find that the -- the exhaustion principle is in some sense implicit in the CSRA.",
  "And I think that there’s ample basis for the Court to do that -- that is, one of the noteworthy features of the CSRA is that the act authorizes judicial review of a wide category of circumstances. But there’s no provision of the CSRA that ever gives a plaintiff a right of immediate access",
  "I mean, I think it’s clear -- it -- it is clear and undisputed that the plaintiff was advised by the FLRA that the grievance procedure was his available remedy and declined to invoke even the initial step of the grievance procedure, and therefore --",

That is, whenever Congress -- whenever this Court attempts to harmonize two distinct statutes to make them -- in order that they would make sense taken together, the result is likely to be that neither statute will be read in precisely --",

  "I mean, it really depends upon the extent to which -- it really depends on where the administrative procedures go. That is, the APA is --",
  "It -- it would in some sense be the allegedly unconstitutional drug test that he’s already been required to take. One of the things that makes this --",
  "Exactly. And one -- one of the --",
  "One of the things that makes this tricky is that under this Court’s decision of City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, if an individual is subjected to allegedly unconstitutional conduct but has no reason to believe that it will happen to him again and damages are unavailable, then the -- there is no standing to seek injunctive --",
  "That’s right. And I think in a that he would be complaining about in the APA suit is not so much the past drug test, it would be the basis for believing that they were, in fact, likely to occur is that he had been subjected to unconstitutional drug tests in the past.",
  "I would certainly think that if -- if there were no question of CSRA preclusion, if we were just looking at the APA standing alone, and an individual said they’ve done this unconstitutional thing to me time after time, my supervisor has ransacked my office time and again or FBI agents have shown up at my door every day and have insisted on searching, I think even if damages were unavailable for the prior unlawful actions, at some point we would say the likelihood of repetition is sufficiently imminent that a right of action should be available in court. And -- but again, I think all of these are perhaps potential alternative bases on which this complaint could have been dismissed, but it doesn’t alter the fact that an adequate basis for dismissal was available under the CSRA and the collective bargaining agreement. it’s simply a question of when the individual can file suit is to presuppose that the grievance procedures won’t work. And there’s no reason to assume that that will happen. That is, Congress manifested -- Congress in the CSRA enacted congressional findings to the effect that collective bargaining and -- and union activity in the public sector are in the public interest. It specifically required that collective bargaining agreements under the CSRA should contain grievance procedures for the resolution of disputes, and I think --",
  "The constitutional claim could go to court, and what -- what we’ve sketched out in the brief is two alternative routes for judicial review in the event that the grievance was processed to its conclusion, that is, a finding by the FLRA. On the one hand, it would be possible to refers to judicial review of FLRA decisions generally, and that provides for review either in the regional However, it -- there is a difficulty with the statutory language in the sense that that provision that authorizes court of appeals review specifically excludes FLRA decisions on grievances. And therefore, if the Court felt like that sort of tweaking of the statutory language was just too much to tolerate, then the available remedy would be in the Federal district court.",
  "It doesn’t say you have no judicial review. It -- the -- the provision that would otherwise authorize judicial review in the courts of appeals of FLRA actions is made inapplicable to grievance procedures.",
  "Exactly, but the -- of major actions.",

  "No, it’s not. And indeed, in footnote 28 of this Court’s decision in Bush v. Lucas, the Court specifically identified warrantless searches as an example of conduct in which an employer might engage towards its employees that would not constitute a personnel action. And we think that’s good authority for the proposition that an allegedly unconstitutional drug test is not a personnel action. Now, if the employee had refused to take the test and been dismissed or disciplined, that would be a personnel action.",
  "Not -- no, not that I’m aware of. Obviously, in -- in other circuits, we prevailed even of constitutional claims. And again, if I could return just for a moment to the -- the point I was making earlier about the grievance procedure. Congress has clearly manifested a preference for the inclusion of grievance procedures in collective bargaining agreements, and -- and given that express congressional preference, it doesn’t seem right for this Court to assume that the grievance procedures won’t work. And this seems to be an ideal example of a case that potentially implicates constitutional issues but that still falls squarely within the expertise of the union, the arbitrator, and the FLRA. That is, the dispute here concerns whether, in fact, petitioner was tested more frequently than his colleagues, and if so, what was the explanation? Was it simply random deviations? Was it potentially a -- a glitch in the computer program that was used to generate a random list of names, or was there some invidious motivation as -- as petitioner has suggested? The resolution of those types of questions falls entirely within the even though constitutional law per se is not what labor arbitrators are best at. to -- to Justice Scalia’s question about why shouldn’t the CSRA be read to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims altogether. I mean, we certainly think that if -- in a sense, that’s -- that’s a debate we would be happy to lose. That is, the Government has not suggested that we have an affirmative interest in preserving judicial review of those claims, and if the Court were looking for a -- the simplest solution to the problem, that solution would be -- have just as much to recommend it as petitioner’s solution, which is that you go straight into Federal district court. However, we don’t think that Congress has spoken with the degree of clarity that this Court’s decisions demand to preclude all judicial review of constitutional challenges, and we think the best way of reconciling that presumption of judicial review with the comprehensive nature of the CSRA scheme is to provide that claims -- constitutional claims are reviewable if, and only if, the plaintiff has made all reasonable efforts to utilize the available administrative remedies.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondents' complaint alleges that Petitioner has entered into a long-term, collaborative venture with outside recruiters in order to perpetrate hundreds, if not thousands of violations of Federal immigration law. That sort of concerted, ongoing racketeering activity alleged in the complaint is encompassed by the text of 18 U.S.C. 1962(c) and it directly implicates section 1962(c)'s core purpose. The judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed. Now, with respect to the textual question, our argument is not that the collaborative venture alleged in this complaint falls within the terms of section 1961(4). Our argument is that it falls within the usual background understanding of the term enterprise and that it's not excluded from the statute by operation of 1961(4). To take the first point first, if Congress had not defined the term enterprise at all, but had used the term enterprise in section 1962(c), this -- the courts construing the provision would have had to determine whether the term enterprise was naturally encompassed -- was naturally construed to encompass not simply discrete legal entities but collaborations between discrete actors. And I think it's pretty clear that the term would have been construed to include such ventures. That is, the -- RICO was enacted against the backdrop of the Travel Act which prevented the use of business enterprises to perpetrate particular crimes and it was well established that a business enterprise meant not simply a corporation or similar discrete legal entity --",
  "I think there are several reasons. First, this Court's decisions make clear that while includes may be construed as exclusive, if it appears alone, when Congress employs the means/includes structures -- structure and introduces some definitions with the word means and others with the word includes, that choice of verb should be taken as advertent, and the Court shouldn't likely conclude that Congress simply used the terms as interchangeable. Second --",
  "No, but the -- the includes --",
  "I think it would be a big difference if the phrase, including but not limited to, appeared in another provision of 1961, but that's not where the phrase appears. The phrase appears in, I believe it's, 1964(c) which deals with the -- the civil remedies provision, and where --",
  "-- where the word includes stood alone within that section, it was natural for Congress to use what we call a -- a belt and suspenders approach, making it clear that the word includes shouldn't be taken as exclusive. The second point I'd make is that the last of -- I believe it's the last provision of 1961(4) is the definition of pattern of racketeering activity. And that definition is introduced by the word requires. The term pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two racketeering acts committed not more than 10 years apart. And this Court in Sedima and then in H.J., Incorporated has attached significance to that choice of verbs and has explained that Congress' use of the word requires, rather than the verb means, implies that two are necessary but not necessarily sufficient. So when we're construing a provision in which the Court has already recognized that, at least in some instances, Congress' use of varying verbs to introduce the different subsections will be taken as significant --",
  "Well, I don't think --",
  "I mean, in terms of speculation about Congress's motive, I think you're very likely right that the reason Congress added a specific reference to groups of individuals was that they were thinking in terms of mob families or syndicates, criminal gangs that had no discrete status as a legal entity. They're not incorporated, but they function as unit. And they had those in mind, and they intended -- they wanted to make sure those were covered even though they were not discrete legal entities. And I think you're likely right that the reason they didn't specifically include groups of corporations is that they didn't have them in mind as likely sources of trouble at the time. But that doesn't answer the question whether they intended to exclude the coverage of those alliances if they would otherwise be encompassed by the normal meaning of the term enterprise. And if it came to cause the --",
  "Exactly. If -- if the term enterprise appeared in 1962(c) but were an undefined term --",
  "There -- there is in the legislative history. That is, the legislative history describes the coverage of the term enterprise as encompassing any associative group. Now, we don't contend from that stray reference that Congress specifically had in mind alliances between corporations and specifically intended to include them. What we do contend is that that legislative history is inconsistent with the hypothesis that Congress anticipated the problem of alliances of corporations and carefully --",
  "First, I --",
  "-- I don't think that at the end of the day, after all the tools of statutory construction are applied, there is a genuine and certainly not a grievous ambiguity. That is, there -- there are two potential sources of ambiguity. One could simply be there's uncertainty about whether the word enterprise, taken alone, would typically be construed -- nobody is contending --",
  "The -- the only question is whether this list should be taken to exclude things that are not on the list even though they would otherwise be encompassed by the normal meaning of the word enterprise. And this Court in many decisions has given Congress a template. It said if you use the means/includes dichotomy, we will take that choice to be advertent and we will assume that when you use means that's intended to be exclusive; when you use includes, that's intended to be not exclusive.",
  "That -- that was part of Justice Alito's question, and I think there are two different senses in which a statutory list could be considered exclusive or comprehensive. That is, one would be legal exclusivity. For instance, the definition of racketeering activity says racketeering activity means acts indictable under the following statutes. That definition is legally exclusive in the sense that if -- if Congress enacted a new statute and it prohibited conduct that was classic mob activity, but it wasn't on the list of RICO predicates, we would say that's out, it's not racketeering within the meaning of the statute even though it would be racketeering activity within a common understanding. I think with the definition of Attorney General, what we have is a different sort of comprehensiveness. That is, it may well be that the definition of Attorney General is comprehensive in the sense of actually listing all the people who could otherwise plausibly be regarded as standing in the shoes of the Attorney General. It may be that Congress, when it promulgated the list, got everything that would have been covered anyway. It's not legally comprehensive or legally exclusive in the sense of directing courts that even an official who would otherwise be regarded as an appropriate surrogate for the Attorney General is not to be so regarded if he's off -- off the list.",
  "I -- I agree with that, but I don't think that in the context of a Federal statute referring to the Attorney General, a State attorney general would typically be encompassed within the meaning of that provision even if the provision were undefined, whereas I think because executive power is -- is generally deemed to be delegable, subordinate officials standing in the shoes of a cabinet officer would usually be thought to be encompassed by the reference to the cabinet officer alone. The other thing we would say, of course, on the -- the statutory point is that there have -- there has been a unanimous pattern of court of appeals decisions in this area. Congress has not acted to contract the definition of enterprise, but instead has added new predicate acts.",
  "I've looked at them and -- I would agree with Mr. Phillips that the analysis doesn't tend to be lengthy, but I think Feldman would be one. By and large, the -- the courts adopt the -- the reasoning that we've adopted here, namely that because the word includes signals an intent to be nonexhaustive or to admit of other things being covered even if they're not on the list, then they should be covered. The --",
  "I don't recall any dissents at least on the point. I -- I don't want to represent that there have never been any. I don't recall any dissents at least on the -- the pure question of whether an association in fact comprised in part of artificial legal entities can ever be covered.",
  "I don't know of any court of appeals opinion that really focus on that -- focuses on that aspect of the question. But -- but, again, we can accept kind of the factual premises about what led Congress to draft the legislation as it did, namely that it anticipated the problem of groups of individuals banding together to commit criminal acts and didn't anticipate the problem of groups of corporations banding together for like purposes. But I think the whole point of having a template, having an established rule that means and includes, when they're used in the same statutory provision will be taken as meaning different things, as to give Congress a clue that if you've tried to list everything but you're not sure that you've got it all, here's the way that you can ensure that some new arrangement that would otherwise fall within the defined term is not going to be knocked out, and if you want it to be knocked out, use the words means. With respect to the second argument, that the -- the core of Petitioner's position is that it can't be held liable under RICO because it's simply conducting its own business, and I think that's wrong for two reasons. First, there's no rule that says a corporation can't simultaneously in a single act be conducting its own business and the business of a separate enterprise, and I think H.J., Incorporated is an example of that. The allegation in that case was that a utility corporation and its officers had engaged in a systematic pattern of bribing the members of a public utility commission to allow the corporation to charge higher rates. And the suit was allowed to go forward on the theory that through the pattern of bribery, the utility was, in practical terms, participating in the conduct of the public utility commission's affairs. Now, clearly in attempting to bribe the utility commission members, the utility was, in a sense, conducting its own business. That is, viewed at a high level of generality, efforts to persuade rate- setting bodies to allow a utility to charge higher rates are an integral part of the utility's own business. That didn't prevent it from simultaneously being a means of participating in the conduct of a different entity's business. And second, there's more alleged in this complaint, and I think some of the questions brought this out. May I finish my sentence? There's more alleged in the complaint than simply the unlawful hiring of illegal aliens. There are hiring inducement and transporting offenses that would constitute separate violations that are antecedent to but not part of Mohawk's business.",
  "Yes, Your Honor. Yes, Justice Souter. Mr. Freibach, who was the earlier foreman, testified that under his watch, he needed between 250 and 300 pounds of cement, and that there was a constant inconsistency in the sludge content coming out of the ponds.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: One of the features of this case that may appear anomalous is the fact that the government is aligned with Stone. That is, it's Rockwell's position that the entire recovery in this case should go to the United States. It is Stone's position that the recovery should be shared with the relator, and the government agrees with Stone. It might be natural for the Court to wonder, why would it be in the government's interest to advocate that a share of the money damages in this case should be given to a private party. And the reason is that the government believes that there are three systemic government interests that are implicated by this case and that would be endangered if Rockwell's position prevailed. First, in our view, Stone is precisely the type of relator that Congress intended to encourage. Stone was somebody who had substantial firsthand knowledge of Rockwell's environmental practices and of its billing practices, and moreover, Stone was somebody who didn't conceal his information from the government.",
  "We agree. And as to Stone's original complaint, the statute frames the inquiry as whether Stone has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations were based. And we agree with Rockwell and with Stone that that refers to the allegations in his complaint. Now the allegations were fairly generalized. They didn't refer specifically to pondcrete, and they covered a wide range of time, from 1980 through to the present, which was 1989 as of the filing of the complaint. Stone subsequently submitted a lengthy affidavit in which he explained what led him to the conclusion that Rockwell was engaged in a systematic practice of violating the environmental laws and misrepresenting the nature of its compliance to the government. That information - -",
  "I mean, there certainly could be a situation in which the government intervenes in a suit but files what can be regarded as a substantially different claim. For instance, if the government had intervened in this suit and had claimed that Rockwell's requests for payment were fraudulent because Rockwell had misrepresented its compliance with the anti-discrimination laws, that would be an example of a fundamentally different fraudulent scheme and - -",
  "It didn't introduce the engineering report. And I do want to focus on - -",
  "He had provided substantial information about a pattern of concealment of environmental violations generally. That at least to some extent was responsible for an FBI investigation which uncovered further - -",
  "We proved essentially the state of affairs that he predicted would occur.",
  "I'm not aware of anything that - -",
  "But nevertheless, the relator had direct and independent knowledge of the information on which his allegations were based. And I'd like to focus on this question of the cause of the insolidity of the pondcrete because I think to regard that as the theory of the government's liability really reflects a misunderstanding of the False Claims Act. For purposes of the False Claims Act counts in this case, it was sufficient for the government to prove that the pondcrete in fact failed, leaked hazardous substances into the environment, that Rockwell was aware that the pondcrete was failing, and that Rockwell nevertheless continued to represent that it was in compliance with the environmental laws. For purposes of proving those allegations, it was not necessary for the Government to offer any hypothesis as to why the pondcrete failed. It would have been sufficient to prove that the pondcrete failed and that Rockwell knew about it. In fact, I wouldn't encourage the Court to read the whole trial transcript, but I think if the Court reads the plaintiff's statement of claims, which is about 30 pages of the joint appendix beginning at JA-463, that summarizes the events that Rockwell -- I mean, I'm sorry, that Stone and the United States intended to prove at trial, and by far the predominant focus is on the fact of pondcrete failures and Rockwell's awareness that they had -- that pondcrete had failed. There were a couple of paragraphs in those 30 pages that alluded to the supposition that the cause of the failure was inadequate cement content. There were also isolated references to that theory at trial. But to characterize that as the theory of liability I think would be a misconception. The Government didn't have to persuade the jury one way or the other as to why the pondcrete failed.",
  "But again - -",
  "Again, the statute doesn't require direct and independent knowledge of the fraud. It requires direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations were based.",
  "His basis for making that prediction was that he believed that the process would malfunction. He was also aware - -",
  "I think independent of whether there had every been a public disclosure, it would have been open to Rockwell to argue in response to the original complaint that Stone couldn't consistent with Rule 11 make allegations as to what had happened at the plant after he left because he no longer had an evidentiary basis for doing so. Rockwell could have made that argument, again regardless of whether a public disclosure had occurred, and the question whether it is a permissible inference for a plaintiff to say, I saw them committing systematic environmental violations while I was there and I inferred that the same thing would go on after I left -- the question that's a permissible inference for a plaintiff in a Federal civil action to make is a question to be decided under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The public disclosure provision serves a different purpose entirely. It's designed for those cases in which the relator has sufficient information to file a complaint that complies with the federal rules of similar procedure, but that information overlaps substantially with information in the public domain.",
  "That knowledge, but I think it's also important to recognize that the original complaint was not focused on pondcrete specifically. The original complaint alleged more generally that Rockwell was engaged in widespread environmental safety and health violations and was consistently misrepresenting to the Government that it was in compliance and -- even though it knew that it was not doing so.",
  "I guess I would -- I would disagree with the premise that his reasons had nothing whatever to do with why the Government is getting money. Again to return to the hypothetical I suggested earlier, if the Government then filed - -",
  "It has to be connected with his allegations. And certainly, if you look at the theory of liability that prevailed at trial, namely that pondcrete blocks were leaking hazardous substances into the environment and Rockwell was nevertheless asking for Government funds based on misrepresentations that it was in compliance, if you look at that theory of liability and then examine Stone's original complaint, clearly that theory is logically encompassed within the more generalized - -",
  "No, and I think I would put that with the hypothetical that I offered about the Government adding a claim that Rockwell had misrepresented its compliance with the antidiscrimination laws. And I think there won't be a clear dividing line, but I think this is a line that courts have to draw for other purposes as well.",
  "I think we would -- I think there could still be a sufficient connection even if his reason for thinking the pondcrete failed, they all turned out to be correct. And again, we would emphasize that that's particularly so here because the reason for the pondcrete failure was not an element of the claim. I mean, imagine if this case had been tried to the jury and there had been an established rule in place that if the pondcrete was shown to have failed because of a defect in the machinery, Stone would get a share, but if it was shown to have failed because the human operator added too little cement Stone wouldn't get a share. If that had been the rule there would have been a clear potential for disharmony between the Government and the relator. It would have raised exactly the specter that Justice Ginsburg alluded to, where the Government prefers to emphasize one view of the facts rather than another and the defendant is getting in the way by suggesting that the relator will be deprived of a share.",
  "Well, I think - -",
  "I mean, I need to know more about the hypothetical, but my initial reaction is that that's a complaint that's easily dismissed based on Rule 11, leaving aside the question of any public disclosure. And I can imagine extreme hypotheticals - -",
  "I think if the complaint just gets over the line, that is if the evidence in the relator's possession is just barely good enough to sustain the allegation of fraud or at least to allow the suit to go forward, there's no reason to read the public disclosure - -",
  "I think we would still want to compare the nature of the fraud that the Government alleged with the nature of the fraud that the relator alleged. And obviously this is a question in which the Court is going to have to balance competing interests. It's possible to come up with hypotheticals in which it seems as though the relator has no equitable entitlement to a share. The two things we want to emphasize are, first, in terms of the way that the lawsuit progresses even when the Government doesn't intervene, relators once they file suit, if they are allowed to proceed on their own, they presumably can take advantage of all of the rules of civil procedure. And those include the discovery provisions of the Federal Rules. And it would obviously be self-defeating to tell the relator: You can invoke discovery and you can learn relevant information from the defendant, but if you didn't know it already you can't use it at trial, because if you use something that you didn't have direct and independent knowledge of before the complaint was filed and it turns out to be persuasive to the jury you can be kicked for not being an original source. I don't think Congress can be said to have had that intention. Second, in cases where the Government and the relator intervenes -- where the Government intervenes in the a relator's suit and the two prosecute the suit together, we would want the Court to avoid a rule that would create artificial disincentives to cooperation between the two plaintiffs. And the idea that relatively minor variations in factual assertions that are ultimately not necessary to the establishment of False Claims Act liability, if those carried the day then relators in future circumstances would have a strong disincentive to accede to the Government's request that one view of the evidence be emphasized rather than another. If the Court has nothing, no further questions - -",
  "It's a minor variation in the sense that it's not relevant to the defendant's ultimate liability. That is, if we had proved that the pondcrete leaked hazardous substances into the environment and that Rockwell knew that it was having that effect and that it nevertheless represented to the Government it was in compliance, that would be enough to establish the knowing submission of a false claim even if we had no idea what was the reason for the pondcrete failure. And even if Rockwell had taken the most Herculean measures to produce good pondcrete and had not departed from standards of care in any respect, if nevertheless they knew that the pondcrete was in fact failing despite their best efforts and they represented that it was succeeding, they would be liable under the False Claims Act.",
  "I mean, my instinct would be that probably he could still recover. I think the question then would boil down to whether the discovery responses are themselves public disclosures such that they would trigger a new original source.",
  "I mean, probably that question would raise no public disclosure issue to begin with, because if there had been no -- at least if there had been no public disclosure of the fraudulent conduct that was revealed through discovery, there would be no need for him to satisfy the original source test with respect to those new allegations.",
  "Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. For four basic reasons the deadline for filing a notice of appeal in a civil case should be treated as jurisdictional and therefore as nonwaivable. First, the time limit sent forth in Section 2107 directly implicates the concerns that underlie the special treatment of jurisdictional issues. It's a fundamental precept of our legal system that Federal courts should take special care to avoid adjudicating cases where Congress has not authorized them to do so. Or to put it another way, our legal system has presupposed that the unauthorized exercise of jurisdiction is an error different in kind from the misapplication of law in cases that a court is authorized to adjudicate.",
  "We would -- we would characterize it as a species of appellate jurisdiction. That is, this Court has often said that it's the fundamental duty of this Court when doubt is -- when doubt is apparent, to inquire into its own jurisdiction and that of the court from which the record comes. And that division presupposes that there are cases over which the lower court had subject matter jurisdiction, over which this Court would not have appellate jurisdiction. For example, situations sometimes arise, particularly in cases that are adjudicated by three-judge district courts, in which there is a dispute as to whether a particular district court order is directly appealable to this Court or should go instead to the court of appeals. And if somebody comes to this Court and this Court determines that the appeal should have gone to the court of appeals instead, the error is characterized as one of appellate jurisdiction. This Court lacks jurisdiction to review the ruling even though there's nothing to suggest that the case as a whole fell outside the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court.",
  "That is an anomaly. The Court has said on occasion that because it lacks appellate jurisdiction it has no power to do anything with the case except to vacate the order. And I think that's a court that I'm not going to try to explain.",
  "But I think Mr. Marshall has identified the second example, namely the final decision requirement of 28 USC 1291. That is, that's universally conceded to be a jurisdictional rule, even though it has nothing to do with whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the case. It is simply whether this particular decision over -- for which review is sought falls within the appellate jurisdiction of the court of appeals. And our point - -",
  "I don't think you need to -- I think you should repudiate any conception that Federal courts have freewheeling authority to excuse noncompliance with statutory time limits for taking appeals.",
  "Well, I -- I think actually both Harris and Thompson are explicable on other grounds. And may even be correct in more limited ways. For example, Harris - -",
  "Yes. With respect to civil cases for which the time for taking an appeal is specified by statute, it's our view to the extent that Harris and Thompson would otherwise support the proposition that district courts may excuse noncompliance with the time limits, those cases should be repudiated.",
  "In criminal cases the time for taking an appeal is not specified by statute. It's imposed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b). But there's no statutory basis for it. There was up until 1988 a provision of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, Section 3772, that specifically authorized this Court to promulgate rules that would establish the time for filing a notice of appeal - -",
  "Well I think it makes a fundamental difference that there is a statute in place. And certainly with respect to circuit certiorari petitions coming from the court of appeals to this Court, this Court has recognized that distinction to be fundamental.",
  "Yes, there's no -- no dispute about that. And indeed if the -- if this case were classified as civil for purposes of -- I mean, as criminal for purposes of the time limit for taking an appeal, it would have been far out of time under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b). Indeed the authority of the district court to have granted the reopening period 180 days later wouldn't have been present in the criminal context.",
  "I think the courts of appeals have not required that they be written on the record but have required that there be a basis appearing in the record for those findings. So, for instance, if Petitioner's counsel had filed a document asking to reopen in the time, but had not represented that he had not been informed of the judgment, then I think that if the court had granted the reopening, that could be set aside on appeal on the ground that there was no support in the record for such a finding. But I don't believe the courts of appeals have required there be explicit findings as opposed to findings that are implicit in the grant of the reopening. The point I was going to make about the certiorari petitions is that this Court's Rule 13.1 imposes a 90-day limit for filing a cert petition in all cases. It is not divided between civil and criminal. But this Court has recognized that the 90-day limit has a very different status is criminal cases than in civil cases. That is Rule 13.2 of the rules of this Court states that when a cert petition is jurisdictionally out of time, the clerk is directed not to file it. And Rule 13.2 cites USC 21.01(c). So the clear implication is that the Court recognizes the time limit imposed by statute in civil cases to be a jurisdictional limit. And the crucial point of Rule 13.2 is not simply that it uses the word jurisdictionally. It's that it gives an instruction to the clerk not to file the petition regardless of whether any other party objects. It's the very type of thing that a court will do as to matters of its jurisdiction, as to matters over which it has an obligation to take cognizance, regardless of the other party's objection. In criminal cases by contrast the 90-day rule applies under the rules, but the Court has recognized that it retains the authority to grant petitions that are untimely filed even in cases where the other party objects. The other thing I would say about 2107(a) and it's -- part of it is reprinted at page 16 of the Government's brief. In the last full paragraph of page 16, it says, the basic time limit for appeals in similar cases is set by 28 U.S.C 2107(a), which states that - - and then the part we haven't reproduced says except as otherwise provided in this section. And then it goes on to say no appeal shall bring any judgment order or decree in an action, suit or proceeding of a civil nature before a court of appeals for review unless notice of appeal is filed within 30 days. And the significance of this provision, this language, is it doesn't simply say a notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days. Language like that would conceivably leave open the question of what happens if the notice of appeal is untimely filed. This language actually says if a notice of appeal is not filed within 30 days, the appeal will not bring the judgment - -",
  "That's correct. So we're not saying that the 30-day limit is absolute - -",
  "-- but we're saying that the rule specifies that if the various time restrictions are not complied with, the appeal will not bring -- I'm sorry, the appeal shall not bring the judgment, order, or decree before the court of appeals. This is specifically framed as a limitation on the authority of the reviewing court.",
  "Well, are two things we would say about Thompson. The first is that as this Court explained in its recent decision in Hibbs versus Winn, it's long been recognized that a timely motion for reconsideration will suspend the finality of the judgment and toll the time for taking an appeal. And the Court in Hibbs versus Winn further explained that under certain circumstances, even an untimely motion for reconsideration will have that effect, if the judge appropriately considers it on the merits. And Thompson can be explained as holding simply that where the Government does not object and the district court evinces an intent to treat the motion as timely and consider it on the merits, it will suspend the finality of the judgment I don't think Thompson has to read -- has to be read to stand for a broader equitable principle. The other thing I'd say about Thompson is that for better or for worse, the Government's brief in opposition in Thompson, and the case was decided on the cert papers, didn't cite 28 U.S.C. 2107; it relied exclusively on the time limit that was stated in the Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure. Therefore the Court in Thompson was not required to grapple with congressionally imposed limits.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For purposes of this case, the Court may assume that the word \"transaction\" in Section 25(b)(1) is limited to the purchase and sale of futures and options contracts. The Court may also assume that, in order to engage in such a transaction, a person must be a necessary and direct participant in the transaction. Even under those - -",
  "When I say \"assume,\" I am saying that the Court need not decide at this point how far, if at all, beyond the core transactions that occur on contract markets the statute breaches. That is, with respect to the hypothetical case of an exchange or a clearinghouse that has an anti-discrimination rule and is alleged to have violated that rule. Yes, on the one hand, you could say that in literal terms that is a transaction subject to the rules of the exchange. On the other hand, I think there is significant force to Respondents' contention that that seems very far afield from what was the core of Congress's concern. And with respect to the anti-discrimination hypothetical, there would also be the argument that there is a different Federal statute.",
  "I think the Court can at least start from the assumption that Congress referred to transactions on, or subject to, the rules of the contract market. And none of the things that have been posited in the hypotheticals, the anti-discrimination, would be transactions on a contract market.",
  "They would be subject to the rules. But our point here is that the United States and the CFTC have not had occasion to decide how far, if at all, beyond the core transactions on the contract market the statute extends. But our point is, even if we look at the core of what Congress was driving at, the buying and selling of futures options contracts, the clearing FCM is a proper plaintiff because it assumes direct contractual liability to the clearinghouse. Even before the clearing process is completed, it was defined as the buyer or seller of the contracts in the NYFE rules, and its participation is essential. Now -- now, we have a somewhat different conception of the relevant transaction than does the Petitioner. In our view, when Eisler executed his trades on the floor of the exchange, he set in motion a process that would quickly and inevitably culminate in the clearing of the trades by the clearing organization, and at the end of the day there would be an array of contractual relationships. Klein would have a contractal obligation to the clearinghouse. The clearing FCM on the other side of the trade would have its own obligation to the clearinghouse. Klein would have an agreement with its customer, First West, that would entail rights and obligations running between them. And there would be a similar set of rights and obligations on the other side of the trade.",
  "I think that's incorrect. I think the customer would also be an appropriate plaintiff, that is, the customer would have his own rights and obligations arising out of the -- the contract with the clearing FCM. But the fact that they might both be conceivable plaintiffs wouldn't mean that they could both recover in the same case. Remember that the statute limits recovery to actual losses. So if the customer here, Eisler and First West, had paid the required additional margin to Klein, and Klein had discharged its obligation to the clearinghouse, Klein would still be a person who had engaged in a transaction. But Klein wouldn't be able to recover because he would have suffered no actual losses. So it's the person who bears the actual loss at the end of the day who would be the appropriate plaintiff. And the fact that in some cases that might be the customer and in other cases it might be the clearing FCM doesn't mean that there would be duplicative recovery in a single case.",
  "A purchase or sale, although we would extend -- I mean we would interpret the clearing process as part of the purchase or sale. And the reason we would do that is that clearing occurs inevitably by operation of law, as it were. That is, once Eisler executes his trades, Klein has no discretion as to whether to discharge its obligation to clear the trades. Klein had previously entered into a commitment to guarantee the trades that Eisler made. And, therefore, what -- Klein's obligations to the clearinghouse followed directly and inevitably from the initial trade on the floor of the exchange.",
  "I think it is a different thing and there are two different bases on which the Court could rule in our favor, that is, Rule 306(i)(2) of the rules of the exchange that were in effect at the time of these trades specified that -- and that's reproduced, I guess, at page 14a of the blue brief. And it said -- a second sentence of Rule 306(i)(2) says every such contract when made by a trading member shall be made on behalf of a clearing member, who shall be the buyer or seller of said contract on the terms set forth therein. So one way to rule for Klein in this case is to simply say even if we focus entirely on the moment at which the trade was executed, under the rules of the exchange, Klein was deemed to be the buyer or seller. But we are also making the different argument and in a sense we think the more important practical argument, that regardless of where the contract ran during the brief period before the clearing process was consummated, the salient factor is that at the conclusion of the clearing process, the clearinghouse would look directly and only to Klein for satisfaction of any obligations arising out of unsuccessful trades. In a sense the clearinghouse could be analogized to a department store in which only the clearing members have charge accounts. And in order for anyone else to make a purchase, he has to make prearrangements with a charge account holder to have permission to charge things to his accounts. And that's essentially what was done here. In order for Eisler to execute trades on the floor of the exchange, he had to have the prior commitment from Klein that Eisler would be allowed to charge trades to client's account. And in that situation, we think it's entirely natural to say that Klein engaged in the transaction, even though Eisler was making the decisions as to exactly what trades to execute.",
  "Yes. I think the Second Circuit's error was not really that it had a misconception of how narrow or broad the private right of action is. The Second Circuit's error was that it misunderstood the role that a clearing FCM plays in the process. The clearing FCM doesn't simply facilitate the formation of contracts between other people. The clearinghouse assumes direct contractual -- I'm sorry. I mean the clearing FCM assumes direct contractual liability to the clearinghouse. And that's fundamental to the operation of the contract markets. That is, the point of the clearinghouse is to give investors assurance that if their trades are successful, they will get paid. And in order for the clearinghouse to pay the winners, it has to have confidence that it will be able to collect from the losers. And the way that it has that confidence is by identifying a small number of people, clearing FCM's, who have demonstrated financial wherewithal and integrity, and saying we are going to look only to you to satisfy these obligations. We are not going to put ourselves in the business of going after large, large numbers of individual investors to ensure that losing trades will be paid.",
  "I'm not sure if I -- if I fully understand the hypothetical.",
  "To answer a variant of it, I think there could be cases in which both the customer and the clearing FCM recovered something. That is, say there is a loss of a million dollars that's attributable to malfeasance by the exchange, and the customer comes up with half of that money -- $500,000. And the clearinghouse uses that to discharge half of its own obligation to the clearinghouse. Now, in that case, both the customer and the clearing FCM might have a cause of action for $500,000. So there would be -- there could be multiple recoveries in the sense that you're describing.",
  "If you assume that consequential damage is arising out of the loss of the business - -",
  "-- could be part of actual losses, then there would be no barrier to each party, the clearing FCM and the customer recovering what it actually lost. Our point is that there is no danger that because the clearing FCM is -- there is no danger that because the clearing FCM is liable for a million dollars to the clearinghouse and the customer is liable to the clearing FCM, each for a million dollars, that they will both get a million dollars. It's only the person who bears the actual loss.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In a consistent line of decisions beginning in 1883, this Court has repeatedly construed the 6-year filing requirement contained in Section 2501 and its predecessors as a nonwaivable jurisdictional limit on the Court of Claim's authority to enter money judgments against the United States. Congress has recodified the statute on various occasions and has modified its language in minor respects. But it has made no change that could call into question - -",
  "We don't, Your Honor. In fact, the Court has held both in Kendall and in Soriano that equitable tolling is not available.",
  "We don't. Irwin read in the way we would read it, established that at least with respect to statutes that provided for private suits against both governmental and private defendants, and perhaps with respect to suits against the government generally, that there is a presumption of equitable tolling. But the Court in Irwin recognized that that presumption could be rebutted. And in both Kendall and Soriano, the Court had relied on, inter alia, the fact that the statute listed specific instances in which the 6-year period could be tolled as evidence that there was no general authority to toll the statutory time limit.",
  "Beyond the seas or subject to a legal disability. The original 1863 version of the statute specified particular disabilities such as infancy, et cetera.",
  "I think there are two bases on which we would distinguish that language. The first is by its terms Chief Justice Rehnquist's sentence was addressed to equitable tolling, not to waivibility. And it's true that the Court in Bowles has linked the two, but it doesn't appear that the Court in Irwin made that equation. That is, in the Irwin opinion the Court recited the fact that both the district court and the court of appeals had ordered the case dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, because the filing requirement had not been met. And the Court said, we think that the statute is subject to - -",
  "It was at least a general rule for equitable tolling with respect to statutes like Title 7 that authorize suit against both the government and against private defendants. And there has been some back and forth in the Court since then as to whether the Irwin language extends more broadly. In Brockamp, the Court suggested that some private analog is necessary before the Irwin presumption applies. In Scarborough versus Principi, the Court seemed to tilt in the opposite direction. But part of our point is, even if the Irwin presumption of equitable tolling extends categorically to all suits against the government, equitable tolling is not the same thing as jurisdictionality or waivibility. The Court in Bowles did link the two, but in Irwin itself the Court recited the fact that the lower courts had dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. And then when the Court concluded that Irwin had not satisfied the prerequisites for equitable tolling, the Court simply said: Affirmed. Now, if the Court had intended in Irwin to establish not simply that equitable tolling was potentially available, but that the time limit was not a jurisdictional bar to begin with, it seems likely the Court would at least have referred to the idea that the dismissal should have been for failure - -",
  "Well, the Court has said both with respect to Section 2501 and its predecessors and with respect to statutory time limits for suing the government generally, that the terms of Congress's consent to suit define the jurisdiction of the reviewing court and a time limit for commencing suit is one of those terms. And I would direct the Court's attention in particular to United States v. Dalm, which is cited in our brief on page 23. It was decided less than 9 months before Irwin was decided. And the opinion in Dalm is suffused with references to the jurisdictional character of the time limit for commencing suit against the government.",
  "Obviously, the government was on the other side in Irwin, so in a sense I'm not the best person to defend the Court's reasoning. But as between the reading of Irwin that would create this anomaly, that there could potentially be a jurisdictional limit that was nevertheless subject to equitable tolling, and the argument on the other side that Irwin sub silentio swept away numerous decisions of this Court that had recited that the, that the terms of the government's consent to suit are jurisdictional limits and a time limit is one of those terms.",
  "Well, certainly the kind of case that the Court was specifically dealing with in Irwin itself, and it's not an uncommon type of case now, is one in which Congress has passed a statute that imposes obligations on private parties and then imposes like obligations on the government. And the gestalt of Title 7, once it was amended to add the Federal Government as a potential defendant and to impose the substantive obligations on the government, was that the government was to be dealt with with respect to matters of employment discrimination in the same way that a private employer would be in like circumstances, and - -",
  "Well, in Franconia, the Court was dealing with a different question. It was what do the words \"first accrues\" mean? And it held that the - - it essentially treated the phrase \"first accrues\" as a term of art, as one that had appeared in prior statutes governing suits against other defendants. And so it saw no reason to believe that Congress intended those words to mean anything different in Section 2501 than they meant in other statutes of limitations. And I guess the other point that I would make both about Franconia and Irwin is, even if you read Irwin at its broadest, even if you construe it to mean that there is a presumption that time limits for suing the government are nonjurisdictional as well as subject to tolling, the Court in Irwin still made clear that the presumption could be rebutted. The presumption is not a limit on Congress's authority. It's simply an aid to construction in situations where other tools of interpretation don't produce a clear result. And here we would say - -",
  "We wouldn't read it to -- if all we had was the text of the statute, we would not read it to permit waiver. And I should explain why. The statute is reproduced in pertinent part at page 2 of the government's brief. And the statute provides \"Every claim of which the United States\" -- \"Every claim of which the United States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction shall be barred unless the petition thereon is filed within 6 years after such claim first accrues.\" And looking only at the text of the statute, the language is categorical. It says every claim that is filed more than 6 years after accrual shall be barred. The statute by its terms makes no exception for cases in which the government fails to raise - -",
  "No. I think often statutes of limitations are written like that. But my point is in the end Petitioner's argument really is not a plain language argument. Petitioner's argument - -",
  "I can understand that if you were looking only at the language of the statute, you would say -- you might say this is not a jurisdictional bar because it presumes jurisdiction.",
  "But with respect to the substantive question presented, namely whether the United States' failure to make the argument in a timely way causes it to be waived, the statute doesn't support Petitioner's position as to that. It is categorical. It doesn't by its terms carve out an exception for cases in which the United States fails to raise a - -",
  "Rule 8(c) says the following affirmative defenses shall be pled in the responsive proceeding, and it lists statute of limitations. I think it could certainly -- it obviously couldn't supersede the decisions of this Court or even of the Federal Circuit - -",
  "I think the rule basically tracks, although not precisely tracks, the language of the -- the parallel Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, and we would read it simply to mean to the extent this is an affirmative defense, it should be pleaded initially. It doesn't say that the defense is waived if not pleaded. But to return to the point that I was making earlier, in the end Petitioner's argument is not a plain language argument. Petitioner's argument is that, notwithstanding the absence on the face of the statute of an exception for cases in which the United States fails to plead the timeliness defense, this Court should read Section 2501 against the backdrop of a large body of law holding that statutes of limitations are generally waivable, and should assume that Congress intended to incorporate that understanding - -",
  "Well, I think -- I think this essentially relates to the point that I was making that, even if there is a presumption of nonjurisdictionality announced in Irwin, it's rebuttable and the presumption is simply an aid to construction.",
  "In our view, yes, it does. That is - -",
  "It's a little artificial to talk about what language Congress might or should have used in light of Irwin to make clear its intent that this be treated as jurisdictional, when Congress in the 1948 Judicial Code chose to recodify essentially the same language that had previously been construed to impose a jurisdictional limit. And the point I was making before about Petitioner's argument as to imputed congressional intent -- in the end Petitioner's position depends on the inference that because there was a body of law out there saying that statutes of limitations are ordinarily waivable, Congress should be assumed to have intended to incorporate that body of law. And our point is if you're trying to impute Congress's intent it makes much more sense to assume that Congress intended to recodify the same reading that this Court had attached to this particular provision, not that Congress intended to incorporate a meaning that the Court had attached to other statutes of limitations that the Court had specifically distinguished from this one. And it's worth emphasizing that the decisions in Kendall and Finn and De Arnaud can't be accused of the sort of loose or less than meticulous use of jurisdictional language that this Court has recently - -",
  "It said that it was unexceptional and it said that many other statutes of limitations used this language, namely the phrase \"first accrues.\" But one of the other points that the Court in Franconia attached significance to was the fact that the Court of Claims had never given that phrase a broader reading in Section 2501. That is, the Court cited that as additional evidence that the phase had not been understood in this particular statute to bear a meaning other than it would have in other statutes of limitations.",
  "I think the principal line of authority in the Federal Circuit says it's jurisdictional, but what can't be disputed is that this Court has said over and over that it's jurisdictional, and the Court has again not used those -- that term in passing.",
  "Well, I think it would be - - again, given the fact in particular that the Court in Irwin didn't speak explicitly to the question of jurisdictionality one way or the other, I think it is not uncommon for a -- a dissenting opinion to make assertions about the reach of a majority opinion, and the majority opinion sometimes does and sometimes does not respond to those.",
  "Well, I -- but I think at most the Court in Irwin was not trying to adopt a clear rule across the board; it was trying to adopt a presumption, while recognizing that Congress could provide in individual statutes for a rule different from the one that the presumption would suggest. And again if - - Congress had already been told that the language it was using would be treated as jurisdictional -- and the Court in the Kendall line of cases had not simply used the label jurisdictional; it had said statutes of limitations governing suits against private parties can be waived if they're not asserted in a timely fashion, but the time limit for filing suit against the United States in the Court of Claims is different. This is a limit on the Court's authority and the Court is required to notice it whether it's pleaded by the government or not. So I think Congress had been told that it was already using language that would have the effect of causing this to be jurisdictional and nonwaivable.",
  "I mean -- I think -- I think you may well be correct, that is perhaps to the extent the drafters of the rule were doing something other than simply incorporating the existing language of the comparable Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. If all they were saying was if there's a statute of limitations out there that would function as an affirmative defense in our cases, in our court, we want it to be pleaded immediately as it would be in a private civil action. If that's what they're saying, you may well be right that the class of cases to which that would pertain is the null set or something very close to it.",
  "Well, I guess we'd have two or three responses to that. The first is, at least before judgment could be entered in favor of the plaintiff, the court would ultimately have to determine not only that there was -- had been a taking, but would have to determine the date on which the taking occurred in order to award compensation, if nothing else. So this seems like the kind of question that would ultimately have to be determined, at least before the plaintiff could be successful. The second thing, as was pointed out before, at least in the majority of cases where there is a viable limitations argument, the government is going to plead it, and so asking the court to look beyond this - -",
  "It would depend upon the court's rules. That is, if the court required a separate statement as to jurisdiction then probably the advocate would include at least a thumbnail sketch of the relevant facts. If it was -- if the rules of the court were such that the advocate didn't have to address jurisdiction unless he or she was actively contesting it, then no. But the -- I guess the more fundamental point we would make is the speculation as to disruptive results would carry a lot more force if the government were asking for a rule that was different from what had been done in the past. That is, even Petitioner would concede that, for the great bulk of the country's history, this rule was treated as jurisdictional, and Petitioner's argument is simply that that line of authority was effectively overruled in Irwin in 1990. And so if in fact treating this limit as a jurisdictional limit would have the effect of disrupting litigation in the CFC, we would expect the Petitioner to have actual evidence to that effect. If we were asking for a different rule than had been enforced in the past, then there would be more - -",
  "I think that's true even as to cases involving barriers that everyone would concede are jurisdictional. For instance, there are cases in which a litigant sues us, and there is great doubt as to his standing to sue, and it may be an issue that we think is otherwise framed in an appropriate context, and the government might feel that it would be to everyone's benefit to get the issue resolved when -- one way or the other. But one consequence of treating that as a jurisdictional barrier is simply that the government can't always have its way. So I don't think -- I would think that you are correct that there might be some instances in which treatment of this limit as a jurisdictional bar would not be in the government's interest. But that's not a basis for holding it to be nonjurisdictional. Certainly the majority of cases involving both -- I think, involving both 2501 and other provisions that impose time limits for suits against the government, in which the courts have held that the relevant limit is jurisdictional, typically the situation arises where the government decides to make an argument on appeal that it didn't make in the district court. I think a case like this one, where the government doesn't argue the point even on appeal and the court of appeals nevertheless holds that the suit was untimely, those are the rarity. But we certainly agree that the logical implication of treating the time limit as jurisdictional is that the Federal circuit did the right thing here. I'd like to say a couple of words about Bowles. I think Bowles doesn't compel a ruling in the government's favor, but it does support our position in various respects. First, as the Chief Justice alluded to earlier, Bowles emphasized that time limits for filing notices of appeal had historically been treated as jurisdictional limits, and the Court said that, given the choice between calling into question some dicta in our recent opinions and effectively overruling a century worth of practice, we think the former option is the only prudent course.",
  "I agree that the Court's opinions didn't note that fact, but I don't think that fact would or should have affected the treatment of the statute as jurisdictional. That is, once it was brought to Congress's attention that there was a potential conflict or tension between the language of the jurisdictional statute and the language of the corresponding Federal rule, Congress had the choice to make as to which should govern, and if Congress had wanted a different result from the one that was in the Federal rule, it could have enacted different language. I think it would not -- whatever we might privately think is the level of attention that Congress - -",
  "But - -",
  "But my point is that, once this was brought to Congress's attention, Congress could have chosen to stick with other language, in which case I have no doubt that the corresponding rule would have been amended to fit the statute. Again, whatever level of attention we might privately think that Congress devoted to this question, the fact is that Congress acted as a body, passed a law, it was signed - - passed statutes in both houses. It was signed into law by the President. And from that point forward, it was a statutory rule and had to be treated as such. So I agree that this aspect of the problem wasn't addressed specifically by the opinions in Bowles, but I don't see any basis - -",
  "I think to treat it as a conforming statute suggests that, in some way, Congress was obligated to do what the advisors told it to do or was obligated to conform Section 2107(a) to the terms of the Federal rule, and that's not the case. Congress could have -- once this matter was brought to its attention, Congress could have enacted whatever statute it wanted. It chose to enact a statute that tracked the preexisting language of the rule, but from that time forward, the notice of appeal deadline was grounded in statute, and it was a statutory limit that applied to Bowles's own notice of appeal. So I don't think there is a basis for saying the case would or should have come out differently if the Court had been aware of the history of the statute's development.",
  "My point is, if we were reading the statute without reference to any precedent addressing either 2501 itself or statutes of limitations generally, kind of the pure myopic, literal reading of the statute, without reference to the legal context, would suggest that \"every\" means every, \"shall be barred\" means shall be barred, and there is no exception for cases in which the government fails to raise the argument in a timely way. And my point is - -",
  "And my point is there is no basis for Petitioner's argument that in inferring Congress's intent the Court should look to part of the broader legal context, namely: Decisions of this Court and others that have dealt with the general treatment of statutes of limitations, but should ignore the other part of the legal context, namely: Decisions of this Court that have said, squarely and unequivocally, this particular time limit is different. This particular time limit is nonwaivable and jurisdictional even though most statutes of limitations can be waived if they are not asserted in a timely way.",

  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In calculating the retirement benefits owed to disabled workers, Kentucky uses age as an explicit decisionmaking factor in a way that disadvantages older employees. Although Kentucky may be able to establish on - -",
  "It does in the sense that, with respect to disabled employees, two employees who have the same total years of actual service but who are of different ages may receive dramatically different benefits.",
  "It's -- let me direct your attention to the relevant provision of the Kentucky statute, and it's at page 7a and 8a of the blue brief. This is with respect to -- it's true that, for a normal retirement, an individual either has to be age 55 with 5 years of service or have 20 years of service at whatever age. But if you look at the requirements for disability retirement in particular, the very bottom of the page, it says: \"Any person may qualify to retire on disability subject to the following. The person shall have 60 months of service, 12 of which shall be current service credited under provisions of Kentucky law.\"",
  "They -- they are different in the sense that they are calculated differently. That is, if all Kentucky had done was say - -",
  "The program - -",
  "I think that's incorrect. There are two distinct functions of -- there are two distinct differences between disability retirement and normal retirement: The first is that the eligibility criteria are different. In order to qualify for normal retirement, you have to be either 55 years old with 5 years of service or have 20 years of service. For disability retirement, you become eligible if you are of any age and are forced to retire due to disability and have at least five years of service.",
  "You can't. The first thing I would say about that exception is it refers specifically to a minimum age, and what that was intended to make clear was that to the extent that Kentucky allows 55-year-olds to retire with only 5 years of service, but requires a 45-year-old to have 20 years of service, that minimum age would not violate the statute. Now, as a result of this Court's decision in Cline, that provision in a sense is superfluous because the younger worker wouldn't have an ADEA claim anyway. But the reference to a minimum age is intended to address that situation.",
  "It is certainly not illegitimate for Kentucky to say: We want to be more generous to people who are forced to retire due to disability than to people who choose to retire voluntarily when they are physically capable of continuing to work. And so if Kentucky wants to say, in the case of an individual who is forced to retire due to disability, we will add additional years in computing benefits to estimate the number of years this person would have worked had he or she not become disabled, that's fine as well. What they can't do, at least what they can't do without establishing one of the affirmative defenses, is use age as a proxy, as the basis for deciding how many years would this person have worked if he or she had not become disabled because - -",
  "If they are going to give the 45-year-old with 10 years of service 10 years of credit, they have to give the 55-year-old 10 years of service - - with 10 years of service 10 years of credit, again, unless they can establish the cost-justification defense. And part of the argument they are making is it would be unduly expensive to guarantee the 55-year-old an additional 10 years of service, because it's much more likely that the 55-year-old will become disabled than it is with the 45-year-old.",
  "Well, to go back to the question you were asking Mr. Klausner, I think if we were looking at the class of voluntary retirees, it would be an accurate generalization to say that those above 55 were likely to have fewer years of service than the younger people. Because the only way that a younger person could qualify for normal retirement would be to amass 20 years of service; whereas, the older person could do it with fewer years. But if you are looking at people who want to continue working but who are prevented from doing so by reason of disability, there is no reason to assume that the older people are going to have spent less time in the line of fire than the younger people. And, in any event, the comparison that we are making - -",
  "If we're looking at the class of people who -- including over 55-year-old and under 55-year-old -- who want to continue working but who have been prevented from doing so by reason of disability, there is no reason to think that the older people within that class, as a group, will have fewer years in the line of fire than the younger people. And, in any event - -",
  "No. No. Under their belt. Under their belt.",
  "It's not just happenstance, because if you're guessing the likely tenure of service of people who take voluntary normal retirement before age 55, in a sense you are skewing the class, because the only people who can do that under Kentucky law are people with at least 20 years of service. So the voluntary retirees, the younger people, as a group, are likely to be -- have longer tenure. But that generalization doesn't hold true with respect to people who are forced to retire due to disability.",
  "No. Our point is that they should use the same computation methodology for both categories of employees.",
  "I think that's incorrect, and that was really the point I was making by quoting from the Kentucky law on page 7a and 8a. The Kentucky provision that I quoted was the provision that establishes eligibility for disability retirement. And it says, as the criterion for eligibility, beyond, of course, the fact of disability, the person shall have 60 months of service. So an individual under Kentucky law who is forced to retire due to disability and has at least five years of service is eligible for disability retirement. The imputation of additional years of service is not necessary - -",
  "Exactly. Well, the purpose of defining the category of eligible persons is to make sure that they do get a retirement benefit even though they wouldn't satisfy the normal age and service requirements for ordinary retirement. And we have no problem with that. Kentucky can say we want to define a separate category of individuals who don't satisfy normal age and service rules but who should, nevertheless, be given a retirement benefit because they have been forced to retire due to disability. That's fine. And if they use the same computation methodology, namely, some factor of actual years of service times final compensation times a multiplier, as they do for normal retirement, that would be fine. Our --",
  "That's correct.",
  "Well, again, there is a an explicit exemption in the ADEA for a minimum retirement age. And so it wouldn't have violated -- even apart from this Court's decision in Cline, it wouldn't have violated the ADEA to say an individual who is 55 with five years of service can get retirement, even though a younger - -",
  "Well, again, I think the - -",
  "There are a couple of things I'd say. The first is that the Act is quite specific in saying that a State may establish a minimum -- may establish a retirement age with respect to its State police and firefighters, but it doesn't say the ADEA is inapplicable to police and firefighters who are over age 55.",
  "There are several different answers I would give. The first is if the greater included the lesser, it would be permissible for Kentucky to say: We will keep the over 55-year-old people on the work force, but we'll pay them less because of their age.",
  "I think - -",
  "I think that's incorrect, that is, the two justifications that have been given for the disparate treatment of older workers are, first, younger workers as a group are likely to need more of a boost; and, second, the younger disabled person probably would have worked longer if he had not become disabled. And so this replicates the situation that would have prevailed. I think, whether or not you want to think of those as stigmatizing stereotypes, it's quite clear that neither of those generalizations could typically be used as a basis for age-based disparities. For instance, nobody would claim that an employer could pay the older workers less because they are likely to be less in need of financial assistance. And with respect to the initial - -",
  "Well, on the whole, the benefit bears a close -- the retirement benefit bears a close relationship to what you have done. That is, the benefit is calculated on the basis of actual years of service, and the purpose clearly is, in part, to reward the employee for service to the employer. But with respect to -- and that's the way it's done with respect to the older disabled worker. His benefits are computed based on what years of service he has actually contributed to the employer. With respect to the younger people, it's not based on that alone. Rather, the State imputes additional years - -",
  "I guess there could be a range of alternatives. One alternative, for instance, would be for every disabled worker of whatever age impute an additional five years of service as something of a rough estimate of the number that person might have worked if he or she had not become disabled. Another possibility would be to impute years of service up to 10 or 20. Again, there would be probably an infinite number of ways it could be done as long as age were not used as, as the basis. The other thing I wanted to say about - -",
  "Well, the other thing I would say about that justification, which rests on I think the valid statistical correlation between how old you are at the time that you're disabled and how much longer you would have worked. Again, whether or not -- I think you wouldn't think of that as an invidious stereotype. But again, it's not a generalization that could typically be used as a basis for age-specific decisions. For example, the Wirtz report makes clear that the paradigmatic pre-ADA practice that Congress wanted to get rid of was a limit of age 50 or age 45 and an employer saying: We're not going to hire anybody who is over that age. And certainly the employer could say justifiably as a group people above that age are likely to have fewer work years ahead of them than people below that age. And if that generalization could provide a basis for an explicit age-based distinction, the Act would really be eviscerated. The other thing I wanted to respond to is the suggestion that, while we might be able to tease this out of the literal language of the statute, this is certainly an unintended consequence. It is not something that Congress would have wanted. I think, to the contrary, this is not identical but very similar to the type of disparity that was present in Betts. That is, in Betts the individual was over the age of normal retirement but had elected to keep working. She became disabled and was prevented from continuing to work. She was eligible for normal retirement benefits. She wanted to collect disability retirement benefits, because again, the reason for her retirement was disability. She was told that she couldn't do it. And the State's computation methodology for calculating disability retirement benefits was significantly more generous than the one that it offered for - -",
  "I think, first, that would be contrary to the way that the word \"discriminate\" has been construed in Title VII.",
  "Well, the court in Thurston has said the language of the ADEA should be construed similarly to that of Title VII because the basic anti-discrimination prohibition was drawn in haec verba from Title VII in the legislative history to the older workers's Benefit Protection Act when Congress amended the statute to cover fringe benefits, which the Court in Betts had held were not covered. Congress did that by enacting a new 29 U.S.C. 630(l) to say the term -- that the phrase \"terms and conditions of employment\" includes fringe benefits. And the legislative history explains that Congress could have achieved the same result by adding a reference to fringe benefits in the basic anti-discrimination provision contained in 29 U.S.C. 623(a), but the Congress chose not to do that because it wanted to maintain the similarity in wording between the ADEA's anti-discrimination provision and that of Title VII in order to reinforce the inference that the two were to be construed in pari materia. The other thing I would say with respect to your reference to age distinctions that are not based on stereotypes is again to return to what I was discussing earlier. The two justifications that have been offered are first, younger people are likely to have fewer financial resources, so they need more of a boost; the second is the younger worker probably would have worked longer if he hadn't become disabled and therefore this is replicating the situation that would have prevailed absent the disability. And again, my point is, whether or not you think of those as invidious stereotypes, they are plainly not generalizations that could typically be used to justify - -",
  "Well, the discrimination is if you imagine - -",
  "Well, it depends on other variables. For instance, if you have a - -",
  "As to the person who is five years away from qualifying by reason of - -",
  "-- years of service, if that person is younger than 50, then they'll be treated the same, because each of them will have - -",
  "But - -",
  "But it is a discrimination on the basis - -",
  "Well, it wouldn't -- there wouldn't be any claim of disparate treatment with respect to those two individuals. But if you have an individual who is 55 years old with 15 years of service and 50 years old with 15 years of service, they are both equally close to the 20-year threshold for qualifying for normal retirement on the basis of years of service. Yet the 50-year-old gets 5 imputed years added and gets a significantly larger benefit than the 55-year-old. Their justification is, well, the 55-year-old is already eligible for normal retirement and therefore, it's fair to treat him differently. And the point I was making with reference to the Kentucky code is the 50-year-old who is forced to retire due to disability is also eligible for retirement. It's called disability retirement.",
  "No, I don't think that's correct. If all the State did was to say disability retirement benefits will be available to people who have at least five years of service and are forced to retire due to disability and we are excluding people who are above 55, in and of itself that's fine. If the only purpose of excluding the older workers is to make clear that they can't get both benefits simultaneously, there is no problem with that. Our problem is that, having defined the class of persons eligible for disability benefits to include only those who are under 55 - -",
  "-- they did use a more generous computation methodology.",
  "It's only one benefit. And really, that's part of our point. It's only one benefit, so why would they say that people who are older will have their benefits computed using a different formula than people who are younger?",
  "Well, first, we are not preventing Kentucky from imputing additional years. We are simply saying the method of determining how many years will be imputed, absent an affirmative defense, can't be dependent on the employee's age.",
  "I'm not quite sure if I understand the question, but I don't think that there is any - -",
  "I don't think there would be anything wrong with Kentucky saying we are going -- in fact, this is what we are asking for. If Kentucky wants to say a younger person who is forced to retire due to disability will be treated as though he were 55 years old, that's fine. If they give him disability benefits and they calculate the benefits using actual years of service as they do for the other -- for the older employees, that there is no ADEA problem with that. Our problem is that they say we are treating him as though he had worked additional years until he was 55 when he hasn't, and when the older employee isn't given that same opportunity. And, again, it is true that Kentucky's system is particularly generous to older employees who want to retire voluntarily. They can retire with as little as five years of service, even though the younger worker would have to have more. But the people on whose behalf the EEOC is suing have not derived any of that benefit. These were people who did not retire voluntarily. They were people who were eligible for retirement benefits, but chose to remain in the work force. And, essentially, they are being told, in estimating how many more years you would have worked, we are going to have an irrebuttable presumption that the answer is zero, even though their very circumstances, the fact that they continued to work after they could have retired, belie that assumption. And just a final point I wanted to make about Betts, is that the system here is not identical, but very similar to the system that was at issue there, in the sense that an older worker who was forced to retire due to disability got a lower benefit than she would have received if she had been younger with the same years of service and the same disability. It couldn't be clearer that Congress wanted to overturn that decision. That was the impetus for the enactment of the OWBPA. So I think there is really -- it's not correct to suggest that, even if we win, this is somehow an unintended consequence of what Congress did. This is the very situation that Congress wanted to cover while providing an affirmative defense to employers who can satisfy it.",
  "It's not available for a regular retiree, and it's not available for a person who is eligible for normal retirement but becomes disabled and is forced to retire for that reason. If the only problem were that Kentucky made those benefits available to people who were forced to retire due to disability, that wouldn't be an ADEA violation, so long as they made those benefits available to the older worker who was also forced to retire. But I take your point that those aspects of the statute introduce a further element of age discrimination without even the justification that Kentucky has proffered for the imputed years. With respect to the children, in particular, that seems to be the only other area in the plan in which Kentucky is directly targeting the people who are in greatest financial need, at least by one measure having dependent children, and yet the older workers are left out of that entirely.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin with the same point that Mr. Olson began with, namely, does the False Claims Act -- is the False Claims Act directed solely at schemes to defraud the government or does it encompass schemes to defraud people who receive Federal money? And we're in agreement with Petitioners that the False Claims Act is directed at schemes to defraud the Federal Government. Our theory in this case is not that the subcontractors are potentially liable because they may have attempted to defraud the prime contractors. Our theory is that the subcontractors are potentially liable because they are alleged to have used false representations made to the prime contractors but with the ultimate purpose of defrauding the United States. And I think if you imagine what would have happened if the allegations in this case are true and if the fraudulent scheme had been carried to completion, it's very clear that the government, rather than the prime contractors, would have been the injured party.",
  "Well, we would say certainly in the context where Allison knows that the engines are to be used for private work, that the False Claims Act would not - -",
  "I think you could still have a FCA claim, if in fact the work was being done for the government contract.

  "Our view is that that would not be covered.",
  "That would not be covered. It would - -",
  "Because the statute -- if you look at page 2 of the blue brief, that reproduces the relevant provisions of the statute. And the one that we're principally -- the two that we're relying on here are subsection 2, which says: \"Knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government.\" And we would say that the reference to false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government should be taken as limited to a claim that is false as to the government. That is, it's false in a respect that the government cares about.",
  "Well - -",
  "That's right.",
  "That's correct. And in that circumstance, I think the scheme could fairly be characterized as one to defraud the prime contractor, because the prime contractor would bear the loss associated with the scheme. And we would agree that that's not covered. Here - -",

  "I mean, I think -- I think it has basically worked. I don't think it has worked perfectly. But I don't think - -",
  "I think there are a lot of cases -- I mean, Medicare and Medicaid fraud is an example that we would deal with differently textually, but those are programs in which the Federal Government provides money. Persons other than Federal officials decide whether the claims should be paid, but ultimately there's reimbursement by the Federal Government. Now, our answer to the question - -",
  "And our view is that those would be covered even if there is a presentment requirement, because subsection (a)(1) of the statute refers to a person who knowingly causes a false claim to be presented to a Federal official. So because there's the reimbursement mechanism we think that would be covered. But a big part of our argument here is that the applicability of the FCA should not depend on these sorts of quirks of timing. That is, to take the school hypothetical that was discussed in the first part of the argument, you have provision of government money for -- Federal money for construction of a school, and the contractors who deal with the State agency defraud the State agency and they produce a shoddy product. Now, if the way that the funding program works is that the State agency pays first and then presents a claim for reimbursement to the Federal Government, that would be covered even with the presentment requirement.",
  "I think our answer would probably be yes. A court might read a de minimis limitation into the statute, but part of our point would be that be that that - -",
  "Well, the answer to that hypothetical -- and the answer to that hypothetical really has nothing to do with whether the statute imposes a presentment requirement, because the hypothetical - -",
  "It could be an (a)(2) question, but my point was that the same type of issue could arise even with the presentment requirement, because if the chemical manufacturer presents his own bill to the paint company, who presents his bill to the contractor who does the painting work, who presents his bill, et cetera, et cetera - -",
  "I guess I would say - -",
  "Again, whatever -- whatever the answer -- the point I was trying to make about the timing is -- again assume away these issues about how much might be de minimis. You have substantial fraud by the contractor directed at the State agency. If the State -- if the way the funding program works is that the State agency then presents its own bill to the Federal Government, we're going to have a good (a)(1) case regardless of whether presentment is required, because we're going to say the subcontractor, the person who did the work, caused the State agency to submit a false claim to the Federal Government and we can recover on that theory.",
  "But -- but if the government provides the money up front, gives it to the State agency and says, use it for the defined purposes, you'll still have presentment of a claim by the State agency, namely the request for funding, but there will be no way to say that that difference - -",
  "But the point about timing - - but the point about timing is if the State's claim is submitted to the Federal Government at a time when the fraud has not yet occurred, the State's claim can't be denominated false, assuming that the State intends it - -",
  "Well, the definition of \"claim\" in (c) says it's a request or a demand - -",
  "Will reimburse, but it also says \"if the United States Government provides any portion of the money or property which is requested or demanded, or if the government will reimburse.\" And so --",
  "That's correct. And my -- my point is the definition of \"claim\" indicates that Congress didn't want liability to turn on this quirk of timing, whether the fraud occurs before the claim is submitted to - -",
  "There's liability if the Federal Government reimburses a claim for expenses that have already been incurred, but under Petitioner's theory, if the Federal Government pays the money up front, the State has submitted a claim but it's not a false claim. And then if the contractor defrauds the school -- the State, by producing a shoddy school, the contractor can't be charged with having caused a false claim to be submitted.",
  "But our point is that - -",
  "That's correct. But fraud - - fraud against the government can occur whether -- the whole point of the definition of (c) is that fraud against the government can occur if Federal money is diverted away from its intended purposes, whether the deceit is practiced directly upon a Federal official or a contractor or a grantee.",
  "There are two principal limiting principles. The first is that the bill has to be submitted to the contractor or grantee in his capacity as such. That is, there has to be a nexus between the provision of Federal funds and the request that's made. So if a subcontractor defrauds Boeing on work that Boeing is doing for a private airline, there's no FCA violation. Even though Boeing literally is a government contractor, it's not being defrauded in its capacity as such. And the second is that the fraud has to be of a nature that if successfully carried to completion could be expected to injure the Federal Government. So in the hypothetical of the cost-plus contract between the prime contractor and the sub and the sub presents an inflated bill, if the loss false on the prime contractor and is not passed along to the government, the claim would not lie under the FCA",
  "That would be enough.",
  "That's -- that's correct.",
  "We would still be asking was the -- whether the fraud was of a sort that the Federal Government cared about. That is, if the Federal Government made a grant with no strings attached, use it as you want.",
  "Then there would be no FCA liability.",
  "Because the fraud would not - - in that -- in that hypothetical, you would have something akin to a fraudulent car repair bill passed along, given to me. I happen to be a Department of Justice employee and I might use my Federal salary to pay the fraudulent claim. But we wouldn't say that's an FCA violation.",
  "Well, we would still ask whether the government has -- the Federal Government has placed meaningful limitations on the way in which the money may be spent and whether the nature of the fraud is to prevent those limitations from being honored. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The police entry in this case was constitutional and, in any event, did not infringe any constitutional right that was clearly established at the time the officers acted. The mandatory order of decision for qualified immunity cases announced in Saucier v. Katz should be overruled. I did want to begin by clarifying the answer to your question, Justice Ginsburg, because I'm not sure if it was entirely clear. There were really two cases here, one of which was the criminal prosecution of Mr. Callahan, the Respondent in this Court. And the individual officers were not parties as to that case. That was handled by the State of Utah. And you're correct that in the criminal proceeding the consent once removed argument was not made. And that led to the motion to suppress ultimately being granted and consequently Mr. Callahan was not subject to criminal proceedings. Mr. Callahan did file a civil suit against the individual officers who were involved in effecting the arrest, and in that civil proceeding the consent once removed argument was made all the way up. It was made in the district court, and it was made in the court of appeals as well.",
  "That's correct. I think the consent once removed doctrine would have its greatest utility in cases where the police suspect but don't have probable cause to believe that a particular individual is engaged in criminal activity, and so they send an informant or an undercover police officer in to try to either confirm or dispel their suspicions. They wouldn't be able to get a warrant at the outset because they would not have probable cause at that time of ongoing criminal conduct.",
  "We certainly think that they had probable cause. There was testimony from police officers to the effect that magistrates in Utah would be reluctant to grant warrants based on these circumstances because of the possibility that the drugs would be dissipated. I am not in a position to second-guess their empirical experience as to the circumstances under which Utah magistrates will and will not grant warrants. But we think as a legal matter that there was probable cause, and that a warrant should have been issued. But certainly there are -- there are plenty of circumstances - -",
  "Well, I -- I would think that with either police officers or with informants you could have some situations in which the undercover operative has very recently attempted to confirm the presence of drugs. And you can have other cases in which the undercover operative, again either an informant or a police officer, could hear rumors on the street that a particular individual was engaged in drug-dealing, might not have probable cause, and they might decide that the best way to set up the operation was to send this person in to attempt to make a buy at a time when probable cause was lacking. But they would want to arrange the operation in such a way that if the operative's experience confirmed their suspicions and gave them probable cause to arrest, they would be able to go in immediately. And our principal contention is not that the consent to the entry of Bartholomew was implicit consent to the later entry of the police officers. It was that once a person has, even unknowingly, admitted a government agent into his home, his expectation of privacy is sharply reduced and the entry of the officers works an insubstantial incremental invasion of privacy. And I would like to return to the point that Mr. Stirba was making. It's true that the informant here lacked the training and skills that -- and integrity, for that matter, that you would expect a police officer to have. But he was for Fourth Amendment purposes a government agent a State actor. If his handlers had instructed him to look for an opportunity to rummage through the drawers - -",

  "No. We think he could automatically ask for the police to come into the home because the incremental intrusion on privacy by having several police officers rather than one to make the arrest would be insubstantial.",
  "I think you don't have that precise rule, but it is nevertheless the case that the undercover operative here, the informant, was a State actor. Had he been instructed to look in private places without consent, his conduct would have constituted a Fourth Amendment violation because he would have been regarded for that purpose as -- as an agent of the State, and he should, therefore, be regarded as a State agent for these purposes.",

  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The question presented in this case is whether the provision of enriched uranium under separative work unit or SWU contracts is covered by the Federal antidumping duty law. The resolution of that question turns on whether the performance of SWU contracts results in merchandise being sold in the United States. The Department of Commerce, which is the Federal agency entrusted by Congress with the administration of the antidumping duty law, concluded after an extensive investigation that SWU contracts do result in sales of enriched uranium. That determination was reasonable and should be sustained by this Court. Now, the fundamental bargain in a SWU contract is that the customer, the utility, provides a combination of feedstock or feed uranium plus cash, and receives in return a specified quantity and assay of enriched uranium, and by \"assay\" I mean the percentage of weight of U-235 within the final product. Now, the customer has discretion to choose among varying combinations of feedstock and cash in order to complete the transaction for a particular quantity and assay of enriched uranium; but the enricher has its own discretion. That is, having received the consideration paid by the utility, the enricher is free to make its own determination based on economic considerations as to the relative proportions of feedstocks and SWUs that should be used to make a given quantity of enriched uranium. So the overall -- the character of the overall transaction is comfortably characterized as a sale, because it involves the acquisition by the utility of a product, merchandise, that it didn't own at the outset of the transaction in exchange for consideration.",
  "Well, indeed, as we've explained in our opening brief, at common law the distinction between a bailment and a sale in that type of circumstance depended upon whether the miller or the equivalent processor was under an obligation to return the very same thing in processed form.

  "We are saying that Commerce could treat it as a sale. And - -",
  "I think Commerce in that hypothetical -- again, if we were talking about grain being provided by the customer to a miller overseas - - overseas, and then the finished product being brought back into this country, I think the logic of the Commerce determination here would suggest that it would be a sale.",
  "Well, I don't think that Commerce had before this incident dealt with exactly this type of situation.",
  "Common law would have treated it - -",
  "It certainly suggests that Commerce could permissibly treat it as a sale.",
  "I'm not sure exactly which precedents you mean. If -- the one that is -- the administrative determination that is cited most frequently is SRAMS from Taiwan, in which the design house provided, I believe it was a design mask to the foundry, and the foundry manufactured the finished equipment and in concluding that it was the design house rather than the foundry that was properly treated as the producer of the goods, the Commerce Department relied in part on the fact that the design house had intellectual property rights in the design mask.",
  "That's correct. And the SRAMs cases is one of the toller or subcontractor cases. And the Department of Commerce relied in part on the fact that the design house had intellectual property rights in the design mask. So it was not fungible property, it was not an input that the foundry could have gotten from another source. The other thing we would say about the grain hypothetical is that when you hear about the farmer providing grain to the miller or the utilities providing feedstock to the enrichers, it may conjure up images of a tangible good that is in the physical possession of the farmer or the utility that is then physically transferred to the enricher. In the case of the miller that is correct. But the way that a utility provides feedstock to an enricher is not by taking physical possession of the feedstock and then by transporting it. Rather, the utility simply makes financial arrangements with the supplier of feedstock, basically cuts a check or transfers funds - -",
  "Well, I think that Commerce's determination suggests, without squarely holding, that it would treat that as a sale of goods because it would involve substantial transformation of the original item.",
  "We do. And I think it's important, to carry on with the thought I was sketching out previously about the way in which the raw materials are provided to the enricher. If you imagine my buying a suit from a tailor, and the tailor says: The price is $600; $300 of that accounts for the cost of the cloth; $300 is the labor that's involved in sewing it into a suit. Clearly, that's a sale of merchandise, even though the price has been broken up - -",
  "Well, the alterations would just be a finishing process and that wouldn't involve substantial - -",
  "But the point I was going to make about the suit, and it applies equally to the uranium enrichment process, is if I say to my tailor, rather than I pay you $600 and you pay your cloth supplier $300, how about I just give you $300 and I will give $300 to your cloth supplier, and it will amount to the same thing in the end, because you won't have to pay for the cloth? If the tailor accepts that arrangement, the economic substance is exactly the same. And it would seem strange to say that it's a sale if I just pay $600 to the tailor, but it's not a sale if I break down the cost in the way that I've described.",
  "I think that the Commerce determination -- that Commerce did not purport to either promulgate a regulation or announce a test that precisely defined the term \"sale\". I think the thrust of the Commerce Department's determination was that substantial transformation was enough, but that the case was much easier by virtue of the fact that the producer -- the enricher dealt with fungible goods and also had substantial discretion to decide how much of the feedstock would be used vis-a-vis - -",
  "That's correct, although it would certainly be appropriate for this Court if it didn't want to address the situation in which only substantial transformation was present, to say that at least when both circumstances were present there was a sale. And again, to distinguish this somewhat from the miller hypothetical, the miller in making grain into flour may have discretion as to which individual grains to use for a particular batch of flour, but it won't typically have discretion as to what weight of grain will be used to make what weight of flour. And the enricher has that discretion as well; that is, to produce a particular quantity and assay of enriched uranium, the enricher can either use more feedstock and fewer SWU's - -",
  "A SWU is a unit of work and it's work in the sense of output; that is, it is the work necessary to separate out a particular quantity of enriched uranium - -",
  "That's right. The amount of -- the separation process or the enrichment process involves a separation of the original feedstock into the enriched uranium and what is referred to as the tails, which is the residue or the depleted uranium.",
  "I'm not sure whether Commerce would treat that as substantial transformation.",
  "Now, in this case -- in this particular case, Commerce noted that there was no dispute among the parties that the enrichment process did result in substantial transformation. So that - - that uncertainly is not present here. But I agree that there is a gray area with respect to substantial transformation that isn't present when you are trying to answer the question: Is the customer getting back the same thing in modified form or is he getting back a different thing? That is, although the contracts between the utility and the enricher deem the enriched uranium to have been produced with the customer's own feedstock, everybody acknowledges that that is not the fact in the real world. And so, what the customer receives back is not like your diamond hypothetical, in which he receives an improved version of the original product. It is as though you had a diamond company that said, we need inventory all the time, and we're prepared to work out an arrangement where if you send us a raw diamond plus cash, we will send you back a different cut diamond. That would be a sale, regardless of whether there was substantial transformation, because you would have payment of consideration for a product that you indisputably didn't own at the outset.",
  "I don't think we have disavowed the position we took in the Florida Power & Light case. Now, in all candor, I would have to say the question of the Contract Disputes -- Disputes Act's applicability to SWU contracts is of a lot less interest to the Federal Government now than it was then, because the reason that arose in a case involving the Federal Government was that at that time USEC was a Government instrumentality and we were representing USEC in its governmental incarnation. Now that USEC has been privatized, the Federal Circuit is unlikely to confront the question whether the Contract Disputes Act applies to this sort of, because these are not -- this is not a Federal entity, in any event. The reason that we think the two cases are reconcilable is that the Contract Disputes Act, as its name implies, is a statute that governs the resolution of disputes between contracting parties. And in that situation, it's much more appropriate to look to the form of the parties' arrangement. And the court -- the Federal Circuit in Florida Power and Light placed a lot of emphasis on the fact that the contract was styled as one for enrichment services. And that is an appropriate consideration to take into account when you are resolving disputes between the contracting parties, but when the whole purpose of the antidumping statute is to prevent contracting parties from entering into arrangements that are mutually beneficial to themselves, but that would and unfairly disadvantage domestic competitors, it was appropriate for Commerce to look behind the form of the contract and to look at physical and economic reality.",
  "Well, it is true that the antidumping statute requires that merchandise be sold in the United States, and we don't contend that the statute applies to price discrimination in services like insurance or banking.",
  "It is ambiguous at the margins; that is, the classic arrangement, the classic sale is an exchange of - -",
  "Yes, and I think this is a statute that has been around for, I believe, close to 90 years now; and in order for it to remain efficacious in this area, Commerce has to be able to adapt its principles to new forms of transactions. Again, that doesn't mean that Commerce's discretion is limitless, but it has some discretion at the margins. If I may, I would like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you. One of the things Ms. Halligan said, and I think it's really a central theme of their brief, is that utilities come to the enricher for services and not for goods. And to understand what it is that utilities acquire, I think it may be helpful to ask: Under what circumstances would the utility have a valid breach-of - contract right? And it is very clear that the enricher's obligation under the contract is to deliver a specified quantity and assay of enriched uranium at a specified time and place. And if the enricher complies with that obligation, it doesn't matter that the enricher decided to -- what they call in the industry -- \"overfeed\"; that is, use more feed staff stock and fewer SWU's to produce the final product. And the utility in that circumstance couldn't file a breach-of-contract claim by saying: I paid for more SWU's than I actually received. Because what the utility had contracted for was a given product. The second thing -- and I think the corollary to that is -- it's potentially misleading to say that every contract is either one for merchandise or one for services, especially when you are contracting to acquire ownership of a commodity that doesn't exist at the time the contract is formed. The only way you are going to get to your ultimate objective is for somebody to create it. And that can generally be described as a service, but it still results in the sale of goods. With respect to the used-car analogy, I understood Ms. Halligan to acknowledge that -- that that would be a sale even though the consideration paid by the customer is partly in cash and partly in kind. And if the customer and the car dealership characterize their contract as one for car-refurbishment services and said that the new car the customer receives shall be deemed to be the used car that it traded in in refurbished form, nobody would contend that that deeming quality should be controlling. Now here the -- the falseness of the proposition that it's the same feedstock is less apparent, but it's equally the case that the utility doesn't receive back its original feedstock. And finally the perspective of tolling regulation in cases, Commerce has essentially said three things: First, we were dealing with a separate question; that is, who is the producer, which sale is relevant, and not whether the goods are covered at all. Second, they said in those situations the tollee was exercising much more control over the ultimate process than is the case here where the utilities don't manufacture anything. They simply pay for one of the inputs. And, finally, Commerce said that if at some level of abstraction there is a tension or contradiction between what we said previously and what we decide today, then what we decide today controls. And Commerce is entitled to make that determination.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: If I could begin with the issue of arranger liability. The Ninth Circuit distinguished what it referred to as the useful product cases and made it clear that it would not impose arranger liability on Shell simply under the theory that Shell had sold a useful product that was later disposed of in a way that contaminated the environment. Rather, the Court of Appeals and the district court emphasized both that Shell had control over the delivery process and that Shell knew that, as the district court put it, leaks and spills were inherent in the chosen method.",
  "No, I don't think they would -- they -- I don't think they would be arrangers for the disposal.",
  "Because even though they might foresee that in some - -",
  "But -- first, I think under ordinary tort law principles a seller's knowledge that a certain percentage of its product would be misused would not be sufficient to give rise to liability - -",
  "There are two differences. The first is that while HP might know that some percentage of its customers would dispose of the material improperly, here the district court found that Shell knew that spills and leaks occurred with every delivery. And the second - -",
  "The second difference here is that Shell arranged for the delivery and controlled the circumstances under which the delivery would be made. That is, Shell hired the common carrier and Shell required that B&B have bulk storage facilities so that the D-D would have to be pumped from the delivery truck into the bulk storage.",
  "Again, at a certain point, once the product has been used by the customer - -",
  "No, because the fact circumstance here was not that Shell or the common carrier transferred control of the D-D to B&B with instructions as to how it was to be used at a later date, and the customer then violated those instructions. The fact pattern here is that the spills occurred during the process of delivery. And to return to Justice Alito's hypothetical, you asked what if Shell deliberately chose a particular delivery company that it knew would result in spills, but did so for economic advantage, that's exactly the case here. That is, at a prior time the D-D had been shipped to B&B's facility in sealed drums, so whatever the possibility that it might be misused later, it wouldn't be spilled or leaked during the process of delivery and transfer. But Shell decided that it was to its economic advantage to require bulk storage of D-D.",
  "The district court specifically declined to make a finding there. That is - -",
  "It says \"FOB delivery or place of delivery.\" And the district court found that B&B acquired what it called stewardship over the property at the time that the truck entered the premises, but that it - -",
  "But the district court - -",
  "Well, the district court specifically declined to find -- to make a finding as to who owned the D-D at the time it was spilled.",
  "We don't think that our argument is dependent upon the question of ownership, because Shell undeniably had ownership and possession of the D-D at the time the arrangement was made, and - -",
  "That's correct. But that would be true in the paradigmatic arranger case, where one company has generated waste and hires a hauler to pick it up and take it away. Those parties could easily provide by contract that title would pass to the hauler at the time the garbage - -",
  "It's more than - -",
  "Knowledge might well be sufficient, but here we have more than knowledge, we have control.",
  "Well, as Ms. Sullivan said, the instructions were given in 1978, fairly far into the period of contamination. But Even before that date Shell had control in the sense that it required bulk storage on the B&B facility.",
  "And its contract with the common carrier required that the common carrier have particular equipment for pumping the D-D out of the truck and into the bulk storage facility.",
  "They have -- they have control of the process in the sense of defining the way it is to be done. You're correct that the actual process of unloading is being done by employees of the common carrier and employees of B&B rather than employees of Shell. But again, the whole point of arranger liability is to not allow the people who set in motion the process that culminates in disposal to get off the hook.",
  "That is - -",
  "Well, I think if -- if Shell had pursued such a cause of action, then the delivery company might well have argued that these -- this was foreseeable and that there was - -",
  "No. And - -",
  "I mean, that's my point. Shell would not have succeeded in such a suit, because the delivery company would have argued successfully this was known to be an inherent consequence of the delivery process that Shell has chosen.",

  "I guess I just -- I don't really understand the hypothetical, because I don't understand the situation in which Shell would be indifferent as to whether its product was being bought or the product of a competitor was being bought.",
  "We agree that the term \"arrange for\" connotes intentionality, and we think it's satisfied here because Shell intentionally set in motion the process of delivery. It insisted upon the delivery being done in a particular fashion, and it knew that spills and leaks were inherent in that process. To use an analogy - -",
  "The further point I would make is that the term \"disposal\" is specifically defined to include spilling and leaking.",
  "To use a couple of analogies, I think if I know that my car leaks oil whenever it's operated and I choose to drive it on the public highway, I think I could naturally be said to have intentionally discharged oil onto the highway. It may be - -",
  "Well - -",
  "Well again, the term \"disposal\" is specifically defined to include spilling and leaking. You're right that one - -",
  "That's true, but - -",
  "If you had a situation, for instance, where the trash company was hauling waste and intended to dispose of it in a more classic sense by dumping it at a landfill, but along the way the truck leaked, and some of the items spilled out - -",
  "-- I think everybody acknowledges that there is disposal there, and I think we would also say that a company that contracted with that trash hauler, knowing that the vehicle tended to leak trash on -- on every delivery, could be said to have arranged for not only the ultimate disposal, but - -",
  "I am following that, but I think that the court of appeals dealt with this and said: Our holding does not suggest that every manufacturer of a useful product is liable down the road if the customer ultimately disposes of it - -",
  "I mean, I think in a sense the argument for liability there would depend in part on an assumption that people will systematically violate the law, like it would be an easy thing for the Court to say we will not assume and we will not impose liability on the basis of the assumption that battery customers will systematically violate the law. But the second thing that would be missing in that hypothetical, even if the battery manufacturer were assumed to know that every one of his customers would dispose of them ultimately in an improper way, is that the battery manufacturer would not be in control of that process. The manufacturer's control over the use of the batteries and their ultimate disposal would be severed once he turned them over, and that was not the case here. And again I think to return to the purposes of the arranger liability provision, the operator liability provision deals very well with the people who undertake the actual disposal, but Congress evidently thought that that was not enough.",
  "I think it is a combination of knowledge and control. Knowledge might be sufficient, but knowledge and control together form a basis for arranger liability. Again, if I know that the particular common carrier uses a truck, to use a variant of my earlier hypothetical, if I know that a particular common carrier uses a truck that leaks oil whenever it's operated on the highway and I contract with that carrier and ask it to haul goods, I think I can naturally be said to have arranged for the discharge of oil on - -",
  "I have -- I have control in the sense that I have deliberately selected a mode of delivery, a particular common - -",

  "Clearly, if the Court reads the term \"arrange for\" to require purpose, we lose in this case - -",
  "-- because that was not the purpose of the transaction. But here there was both knowledge and control. And in terms of fairness to Shell, I think it is worth noting that in the typical arranger setting, where a person asks a trash hauler to come pick up my trash and deposit it in an appropriate place, that the arranger's ultimate liability may be determined very substantially by steps that the hauler takes afterwards; that is, if the arranger believes that the trash is going to be disposed of safely, but in fact the hauler dumps it in a way that will contaminate the environment. The arranger was - -",
  "We haven't used the word \"waiver\" in our brief and -- but we concede that the railroads and Shell, at least in a cursory way, raised the issue of apportionment at trial, and the Ninth Circuit found that was sufficient to preserve it. In our view, this is like any case in which a party with the burden of proof on a particular issue asserts that a particular proposition is true but fails to introduce sufficient evidence to carry its burden. You wouldn't speak of that as waiver, but it's still a failure of the party to come forward with enough to carry the day. And you - -",
  "No, I think that would be an acceptable approach. I think that - -",
  "Well, I guess we would have two responses. The first is, although the district court certainly believed that he was -- the district judge believed he was building in a margin of safety, in our view it's still speculative as to whether the railroad's share of the contamination exceeded or was less than 9 percent. But the more fundamental point is the one that you raised in one of your questions; that is, the ultimate harm to the government in a practical sense is the incurrence of response costs, and in general that's the way that damages are measured in a CERCLA case. You don't ask, what threat -- what was the degree of public -- of threat to the public safety that was posed by the contamination? You ask, how much did it cost to clean it up? And it - -",
  "Well, I think -- I don't think that the record kind of establishes the relative costs of different contaminants. What I understood Ms. Mahoney to say - -",
  "What I understood her to say was that the cost of the remedial action is proportional to the mass of chemicals to be removed, and we do dispute that proposition. The railroad's expert, Dr. Kalinowski testified about the remedial action that the government at that time was contemplating, and it was what was referred to as \"a pump-and-treat system,\" where water would be pumped out of the aquifer and it would be treated with granular-activated carbon, or GAC, and that was a method of removing the contaminants so that the water could be pumped back in. And Dr. Kalinowski said the amount of GAC that would be needed to implement that remedy would be proportional to the mass of the chemicals involved, but that the crucial point for these purposes is the treatment with GAC is only a small portion of the pump-and-treat remedy; that is, it's essential to drill wells, pump the water out, then treat it, and then under the prior remedial approach, pump it back in. And then - -",
  "I think the first preliminary point is there's no reason to think that the cost of the remedy as a whole would be proportional to the mass of the contaminants because you have very substantial fixed costs, but the other point I would make is this is where the insolvency of B&B really seems to us to become crucial because, if you had all solvent defendants and the evidence showed that the remedy the government implemented would have been more or less the same if it had only been 10 percent of the contamination, 30 percent of the contamination, or 100 percent of the contamination, that so much of the costs were fixed costs that reducing the volume was really not going to affect the cost in any meaningful way -- if you had all solvent defendants, it might still be the case that dividing the costs up in proportion to the contamination they caused would do rough justice.",
  "Well, I believe her first answer was the cost of the remedy would be proportional to the amount of contamination, which we disagree with, and we don't think Dr. Kalinowski's testimony bears that out, because all he said was the amount of granular-activated carbon that would be necessary is proportional to the mass of contaminants. And that - -",
  "Well, as to the first point, the comment h, you're right, doesn't cite cases, and it does say that this -- the insolvency of the defendant need not prevent apportionment, only that it would provide a basis for doing so in exceptional cases. But in our view, the exceptional case would be one in which the ultimate determination was that the cost of the remedy, the amount of the relevant harm, would be more or less the same even if only one defendants's contamination were at issue, that it - -",
  "Well, we would say even as to 10 or 20 percent, if it were established that the remedy the government would have been required to implement, had the only source of contamination been leakage on the railroad parcel -- if it were established that the government could have cleaned that up at 10 percent or 20 percent of the cost of the remedy that was actually chosen, then there might be a sound basis for apportionment despite the insolvency of B&B. But our big point is, at the very least, the government should not be left holding the bag for costs that it would have been required to incur if the railroad parcel had been the only source of contamination, because - -",
  "We don't have findings either way. That is, the district court framed the relevant inquiry as what percentage of the contamination was attributable to the railroad parcel, to the Shell-controlled deliveries, and to the B&B parcel. But it made no finding one way or the other as to what the cost of the remedy would have been if only the -- the only source of contamination had been the railroad parcel. And certainly the -- the primary equitable thrust of the argument on the other side is it's unfair to make us pay for somebody else's contamination. But to the extent that the government would have been required to implement a remedy this costly or even 60 percent this costly had the railroads or Shell been the only source of contamination, by imposing at least that amount of liability, we're not asking for them to pay for B&B's contamination. We're simply asking for them to pay for the response costs that their own - -",
  "Well, indeed, the second restatement says as a categorical matter that if either of two causes would have been independently sufficient to bring about the result, then there's joint and several liability. The example that the restatement gives is two merging fires that destroyed a building. And so I think it is established in -- in the second restatement that the -- there is no apportionment if either of two causes would have brought about the -- the feared harm. With -- with respect to the third restatement, I would say that at least in the case of - - you're -- you're right. There is no exact counterpart to comment (h) in the third restatement. But at least as to indivisible harms -- and I think this is potentially an indivisible harm that the government would have been required to undertake more or less the same response action regardless of the source of contamination. At least as to individual harms, the third restatement gives a variety of approaches that a local jurisdiction could take. There's joint and several liability, pure several liability, and then there are several permutations. And the third restatement is - -",
  "I don't know that -- I think you should take it as a given because it was the defendant's burden to prove different divisibility. But I think if you don't regard the defendants as having the burden, I don't think there is an evidentiary basis for feeling confident one way or the other as to whether the harm was indivisible. But with respect to - -",
  "I don't think so, and this Court in Norfolk and Western -- it was dealing with a different statute, but it said when you're looking at the restatement, it's more important what the state of the law was when Congress enacted the statute rather than what the common-law principles are now. And as we've said in our brief, we think for that reason the second restatement is the more crucial document. But if you were to look at the third restatement, one of the things you would find is that the drafters, as to indivisible harms, identified a variety of approaches that a local jurisdiction could take -- expressly decline to choose a preferred one among them, but said the most important determinant in choosing between them is how will the risk that a particular defendant be insolvent will be allocated. So the drafters of the third restatement certainly didn't treat insolvency as a factor that should be ignored in citing questions of an apportionability.",
  "That's correct.",
  "I guess that's true. To the argument that I've just been sketching out, that -- that the crucial question is what response costs the government would have been required to bear if -- if only the railroad parcel's contamination had been at issue, our argument is that the -- the railroads failed to prove divisibility. But another option would be to remand for factual proceedings to address that question.",

  "Well, I think the Court has already crossed that bridge in Wisconsin Right to Life by saying the statute could constitutionally be applied only if it were the functional equivalent of express advocacy, and -- so that would be the -- and we accept that constitutional holding. That would be the relevant constitutional question. I wanted to return for a second, Justice Alito, to a question you asked about the purported interchangeability of the Internet and television. And it's certainly true that -- that a growing number of people are coming to experience those media as essentially interchangeable, but there are still a lot of people either who don't have computers at all or who use their televisions and their computers for fundamentally different purposes. And I think it's evident that Citizens United perceived the two media to be distinct because it was willing to pay $1.2 million to a cable service in order to have the film made available on -- by Video On Demand, when Citizens United could have posted the film on its own Web site, posted the film on YouTube and could have avoided both the need to make the payment and the potential applicability of the electioneering communications provisions.",

  "Well, I think - -",

  "It would depend on the ground under which you reached the conclusion that the film was protected.

If you concluded that they're all the same but they're all protected, then obviously we would lose both cases. But, again, you would have to - -",
  "That's correct. Now, it may be the case -- it may be rarer to find a 90-minute film that is so unrelenting in its praise or criticism of a particular candidate that it will be subject to no reasonable interpretation other than to vote for or against that person, but when you have that, as I think we do here, there's no constitutional distinction between the 90-minute film and the 60-second advertisement. And we would stress with respect to the film that what makes this, in our view, an easy case is not simply that the film repeatedly criticizes Hillary Clinton's character and integrity. The clincher is that the film repeatedly links Senator Clinton's purported character flaws to her qualifications for president.",
  "That's essentially the argument that a majority of this Court rejected in Wisconsin Right to Life. That is, that was part of the basis on which Congress enacted BCRA, part of the reason that it wanted to establish a purely objective test based on naming an identified candidate and airing in proximity to the election. Congress recognized that in many situations the most effective advocacy is the subtler advocacy. And the lead opinion in Wisconsin Right to Life said -- I think recognized -- that it will foreseeably be the case that corporations will craft advertisements that are, in fact, intended to influence federal elections, but that are sufficiently subtle and opaque that they won't constitute the functional equivalent of express advocacy. And -- and the lead opinion simply said that's the price that we have to pay in order to ensure that an unduly broad range of corporate speech is not restricted. And we accept that holding, but in this case what we have, people may feel -- it is not subtle. People may feel that because it's not subtle, it's less likely to be effective. But the Court's decisions have never drawn a Constitutional line between advocacy that is likely to be effective and advocacy that is not. Clearly, if this were express advocacy -- I think clearly, if the -- the narrator had said in the first 30 seconds of the film: A Hillary Clinton presidency would pose a danger to the country, it's important for all citizens to vote against Hillary Clinton, what follows are extended analyses of episodes in her past that reflect Hillary Clinton's unsuitability for that office. And if then in the last 89 minutes of the film the film-maker had made no overt reference to the upcoming election but had simply given a negative portrayal of Hillary Clinton, the person, that would be express advocacy that would be proscribable even without regard to BCRA. So that if - -",
  "Well, it's not clear whether it was presented to Congress or not. It is certainly true that it was not the focus of congressional attention. But we know from the definition of \"electioneering communication\" what attributes Congress wanted to make relevant to the coverage determination. That is, it chose to restrict this to broadcast, cable, and satellite communications and to leave out the print media. It chose to restrict it to advertisements or other communications that were aired within a specific proximity to the election. If it had been unconcerned with communications over a certain length, it could certainly have made that part of the statutory definition, but it chose not to do that.",
  "I am afraid I am not familiar enough with that film to know whether it would have constituted -- to -- to make an informed judgment about whether that would have constituted the functional equivalent of express advocacy under Wisconsin Right to Life. And, of course, the \"electioneering communication\" definition would apply only if the film had been broadcast within a specified proximity to a primary or general election in -- in 2004. But I think - -",
  "Well, I think -- I think the -- first of all, I think if we had tried to make the argument in McConnell that the BCRA provisions -- or - - or in any other case that the BCRA provisions are constitutional as applied to 30- or 60-second advertisements because they are defensible means of protecting listeners who, by hypothesis, don't want to hear the message in the form of a captive audience, I don't think we would have gotten very far. I think it's certainly true that people have a wide variation of attitudes towards campaign advertisements. Some of them find them irritating, and, of course, they can hit the mute button or -- or leave the room, or in the case of people who use TiVo or VCRs can simply fast-forward through them. But the whole premise of the congressional regulation and the whole premise of the corporations' willingness to spend these massive amounts of money was that enough people will be interested in the advertisements that they will ultimately have an electoral effect. And -- and so if you compare the- - the film to the advertisement, the advertisements in one sense you could say are a less effective mechanism because a lot of the people who reach them are unwilling listeners or uninterested. But, on the other hand, they're more effective because they reach more people. The -- the flip side is that with a film you reach a smaller audience. It is certainly a more limited group of people who will sign up to receive the movie, but they are more interested in the message. I don't think you can operate on the hypothesis that there is no - -",
  "Well, I think it was - -",
  "I think it would be impossible to divide media up in that way based on the relative likelihood that the recipient of the message will want to hear it.

You could say - -",

  "No. Indeed, the appellant in its complaint simply alleged affirmatively that his communication, if aired on DVD -- I mean if aired on VOD would fall within the statutory definition of \"electioneering communication.\"",
  "That's correct. This Court has recognized a constitutional exemption for two disclosure requirements in cases where disclosure would have a reasonable likelihood of leading to reprisal.",
  "It seems unlikely that reprisals would occur because Citizens United -- this is obviously a new film, but it is of a piece with communications that Citizens United has engaged in.",
  "I guess the point I was going to - -",
  "Well, the point was that they have disclosed in the past and have provided no evidence of reprisals. But I think the Court's decisions are clear that the burden is on the organization to show a reasonable likelihood, at least to -- to set the -- the ball in motion. And the three-judge district court here said essentially what this Court said in McConnell with regard to a variety of plaintiffs who included Citizens United. That is, the Court said in McConnell and the three-judge district court here that the plaintiffs had made vague allegations of the general possibility of reprisals but had offered no concrete evidence that their own members - -",
  "Well, I think the alternatives would be to say that disclosure requirements are categorically unconstitutional, which would be an extreme departure from this Court's prior precedents or --",
  "No. I mean I think the -- if the -- we think the test in McConnell is workable; that is, leave it up to the organization to establish particularized proof of a reasonable likelihood of reprisal.",
  "I mean, it would depend to some extent on the characteristics of the ad. Probably not, but I think if the alternative -- the two alternatives to the approach that the Court has taken previously would be first to say these requirements are unconstitutional across the board; or the Court could say as applied to organizations that engage in especially intemperate or extreme speech of the sort that might seem more likely to subject its proponents to reprisal, the disclosure requirements are categorically unconstitutional there. I think that would be itself an anomalous and counterproductive content-based distinction if the mere fact of the extremity of your speech insolated you from a constitutional -- from a requirement that would otherwise be constitutional.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To explain the threat that the OCC believes the State's enforcement regime poses to the national banking system and OCC's administration of that system, I would like to begin by going back to a colloquy between Ms. Underwood and Justice Breyer near the beginning of the argument. And Justice Breyer raised the possibility that a myriad of State attorneys general would file - - would pursue similar antidiscrimination claims, and Ms. Underwood's response was there really would be no problem because they are all applying the same substantive standard. And I think at a very high level of generality that is so; that is, the Federal statute and the State statute both say no discrimination on the basis of race in extensions of credit. But I think when you get to the way in which the statutes are administered, there is at least the potential for significant differences, because - -",
  "We would - -",
  "The Federal Government wouldn't have the right to alter State law. The Federal Government would have the authority to make its own assessment of whether the State law was pre-empted based upon those distinctions.",
  "I give two examples from the national banking system, itself. The first is the Riegle-Neal amendments, which Justice Souter was alluding to. And the amendments don't simply say that OCC shall enforce non-pre-empted State laws. It says that those laws shall be enforced by the Comptroller of the Currency.",
  "I don't think so with the \"shall\" in combination with the passive voice. That is, if you had a statute that said a certain category of suits shall be adjudicated by the Court of Federal Claims, I think that would mean not simply that the Court of Federal Claims would be required to adjudicate them if a case was brought before it, but I think that would unmistakably identify the Court of Federal Claims as the exclusive tribunal - -",
  "I agree that if the statute simply -- if the statute used the active voice and said the OCC shall enforce these laws, there would be a better argument that the OCC's authority was not exclusive. But when the statute said -- says these laws shall be enforced by the Comptroller of the Currency, I think the clear implication is this is the exclusive mechanism by which the laws - -",
  "Well, let me give you another example from the national banking system, and that is 12",
  "Let me just give you a second example very quickly. 12 U.S.C. section 85, which was an issue in Smiley, deals with the maximum rate of interest that national banks may charge, and it says that they may charge as much as the law of the State in which they are located allows and no more. And that is a similar system in that to determine the maximum rate of interest that the bank may charge, you look to State law. You defer to the choice of the State legislature, but the enforcement regime with respect to administrative enforcement is exclusively Federal. It's only the Federal authorities that can go after - -",
  "Well, another example would be the Similar Crimes Act, which provides for the incorporation of State law with respect to - -",
  "Those provisions - -",
  "Those provisions do accomplish incorporation of State law as Federal law. But this Court has repeatedly said, most recently in Watters, that State law applies to national banks only insofar as Congress shall see fit to permit it. So - -",
  "That is certainly true, that the -- the State's exercise of remedial discretion may be different from the Federal Government's. But even before that stage, if you look at the letters in the Joint Appendix that the New York Attorney General's Office sent to the national banks in question, basically the thrust of the letters was: We have identified what we believe to be troubling statistical disparities in terms of the terms on which the credit was offered to applicants of different races. If those disparities are not satisfactorily explained, that it -- you may be in violation of State fair lending laws. Therefore, give us a wide variety of information that would allow us to determine whether you have a satisfactory explanation. And I think it's clear that had this process been allowed to run its course, what the New York Attorney General's Office was going to do was assess the bank's own criteria for making lending decisions to decide whether those criteria were suitable and decide, therefore, whether they provided a satisfactory explanation for the statistical disparities that had been observed. And once the New York A.G. is in the business of passing upon the adequacy of the bank's lending criteria, he is right on the -- the OCC's - -",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, the point that has been made at various times in the argument that the State law basically tracks Federal law, I think, is an answer to that question; that is, whatever incentive the Federal Government might have to enforce idiosyncratic features of State law that didn't have a Federal analogue. Here the State law in question prohibits discriminatory practices that are already prohibited by Federal law. So whether OCC and HUD set out to enforce State law, if they are vigorously enforcing Federal law, they will in the course of doing that vindicate the State's prerogatives.",
  "They -- they don't say it in -- with quite that degree of clarity, but there is a colloquy quoted in the -- the brief for the Clearing House between -- I believe it's Senator D'Amato and - -",
  "And it is -- it is to the effect that Senator D'Amato expresses the concern that this may subject the -- the national banks in their branch activities to State supervision. And the response is that's not the case. That will happen with branches of State banks, but with respect to branches of national banks the supervision will be by the OCC.",
  "Well, section 36(f)(1)(A) refers to a very limited category of State laws that include State fair lending laws and said these laws will not be pre-empted unless they would be pre-empted with respect to national banks generally. And then 36(f)(1)(B) says the laws in that preceding paragraph shall be enforced by the comptroller of the Currency. And so even if the colloquy used the term \"supervision,\" the focus of the statutory language was -- was on a pretty narrow category of laws. I would like also to refer the Court to 12 U.S.C. 484(b), which I think is relevant here, and it is on page 1a of the appendix to the government's brief. And it is an express exception to the general rule against the exercise of visitorial powers. And it says, \"Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, lawfully authorized State auditors and examiners may at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice to a bank review its records solely to ensure compliance with applicable State unclaimed property or escheat laws.\" Now, the basic thrust of - -",
  "I think that would be the implication of the provision, but the significant point for our purposes is that it refers solely to ensure compliance with applicable State unclaimed property ordinances and laws.",
  "Yes, we would because that would be going to the banks' federally authorized banking - -",
  "I mean, it might be that in that instance the discrimination would be unlikely to persist, but the basic - -",
  "Yes, the way the regulation is written, it speaks to State efforts to enforce laws that are directed at the bank's federally authorized banking activities.",
  "No, the regulation does sweep more categorically with respect to inspection of bank records. New York would not be forbidden to file lawsuits to enforce its employment discrimination laws.",
  "Yes, a certain - -",
  "The part of the point I was trying to make was, even if the substantive State law on its face is not pre-empted because it is identical to the Federal law, once we get to the enforcement stage where the relevant enforcement agency is saying your statistical disparity constitutes a violation because it is not justified by sound banking practices, inevitably that judgment is going to put the State regulator in the business of doing what OCC does. And if 50 different State attorneys general have slightly different ideas of what constitutes an adequate banking justification for lending criteria that produces statistical disparity, then the problem is multiplied. Then - -",
  "Well, the other point I would make about this is that it is accurate to say that under the Federal regime the State is entirely disabled from enforcing its own fair lending law. As Ms. Underwood alluded to in the opening part of the argument and as the Petitioner's reply brief explains at pages 25 and 26, the Fair Housing Act does contain a mechanism by which a State agency -- in the case of New York, it's the Division of Human Resources --- can be certified by HUD to enforce the State fair lending laws. But that certification entails two different steps: First, HUD has to determine that the substantive State law is -- I believe it's substantially equivalent to the comparable Federal law. And, second, HUD monitors the performance of the enforcing agency, the particular agency under State law that carries out that responsibility, and HUD can thereby make sure that enforcement as well as the substance of the law are consistent with Federal law.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me start by following up on the discussion of the Morse and the telephone cases, because it's certainly our view that those would come out the same way under our test as -- as they actually did in practice.",
  "Yes.",
  "And, you know, Justice Scalia, you mentioned how to win friends and influence people. I think at a certain level of generality you could describe both Dale Carnegie and Alexander Graham Bell as people who devised methods of communicating more effectively. The reason that Bell's method was patentable was that it operated in the realm of the physical. Bell had devised a process implemented through machines by which sound was transformed into electronic current. Current was then transmitted over a distance and transformed back into sound. Innovations as to new techniques of public speaking, new techniques of negotiations, techniques that go to the substance of what is said may be innovative. They may be valuable. They are not patent eligible because they don't deal in the realm of the physical. So while the industrial processes that we discussed at some length in our brief were at the time of the framing the paradigmatic patent eligible processes, they were -- they are not the only processes that can be patented. In a --",
  "I -- I think we would certainly prefer to win on our primary ground, and let me say a couple of things about that. First, we would fairly vigorously resist the notion that the rule that was announced by the Federal Circuit is rigid or inflexible. That is, all that the Federal Circuit has really said is that to have a patent-eligible process you have to identify some link to a machine or a transformation of matter. And the Federal Circuit has said with respect to some processes the link to the machine may be so attenuated, the machine part of the process may be such a small segment of the process as a whole, that this wouldn't be enough. But the Federal Circuit said: We leave for another day the hard questions that will arise when part of the process is machine-implemented and another part is not. And in order for the PTO and the Federal Circuit to go about the business of devising more precise rules as to when particular links to machines are sufficient to create patent eligibility, we first need to establish the -- the basic principle that some link to a machine or transformation is necessary. So I think we -- we have made the alternative argument in our brief, and I think it is a basis for affirmance. But if the Court decided the case on that basis, we would lose at least the -- the limited clarity that the Federal Circuit's opinion has provided; that is, it would still be open to people in the future to devise new contractual arrangements designed to allocate risks, new methods of teaching antitrust, and --",
  "I think that would be incorrect, and it would create problems of its own. That is, the -- the innovation that was held to be patent eligible in State Street Bank was not a process. The Federal Circuit was not construing the statutory term \"process.\" It was construing the statutory term \"machine.\" And it said, in essence, a computer that has been programmed to perform various calculations in connection with the operation of this business is a machine. It went on to say the opposing party in that case had not raised any objection under section 102 or 103, and, therefore, the Federal Circuit –-",
  "Well --",
  "Well, again, I think that the invention that was held to be patent eligible in State Street is commonly described as a business method, even though it was held to be patent eligible as a machine rather than as a process. So, to say that business methods are categorically ineligible for patent protection would eliminate new machines, including programmed computers, that are useful because of their contributions to the operation of businesses. And similarly, the court -- the Federal Circuit in other cases has held that a claim to new and innovative computer software may be held patentable as a process, as a method of accomplishing particular tasks through the use of a computer, and those might be business-related tasks. So, to say that business methods were ruled out would itself be a fairly sweeping holding.",
  "If the Court said that in the limited area of business methods, if there is no machine or transformation, there is no patent eligibility --",
  "Yes.",
  "Let me take those points --",
  "-- in the order that you made them.",
  "Let me address those points in order. The first thing is that in Diehr when you had the “e.g.” cite, it was \"e.g., transforming an article into a different\" state of -- state or thing. And I think the obvious inference is \"e.g.\" was used because the other prong of the machine-or-transformation test is use as a machine. That is, in the context of Mr. Morse's invention or Mr. Bell's invention, there is transformation of a sort, but it wouldn't naturally be characterized as transformation of matter. Those things were held to be patent eligible not because they transformed matter, but because they involved the use of a machine. And so, what the Court in Diehr said transformation of a matter or an article into a different state or thing is the clue to the patentability of a process that doesn't involve a particular machine. And the -- the type of process it had in mind was the process that was described in Corning v. Burden or the process in Cochrane v. Deener, situations in which an individual had devised a method of, in one sense -- one case, it was manufacturing flour, and in another case it was rolling puddle balls, of manufacturing items. And that person said, here is the series of steps that you have to go through, but it’s not essential that you use any particular tool or machine for each of these steps. That was why the word --",
  "Well, I guess there -- there were two different places, I believe, at which we identified ways in which this sort of hedging scheme might be made patent eligible. The first is we described a hypothetical interactive Website in which people -- parties and counterparties could essentially find each other by the computer and could agree to terms on that basis. And in that situation, the -- the computer would be at the heart of the innovation. It would be --",
  "I think an -- an interactive computer technique, one in which you sign on and can find people without tracking them down specifically, can simply identify yourself on the Website as somebody who is interested in engaging in a particular transaction and a potential counterparty can find you, is different from the Yellow Pages. But I guess the fundamental point I would make is -- and this is really responsive to the second part of Justice Breyer's question -- I think it is both a virtue and a vice of the test that the Federal Circuit has announced and that we are advocating that it doesn't solve all the hard questions. That is, the Federal Circuit has said since this particular patent applicant didn't identify any machine or any transformation that would be necessary to the accomplishment of its method, that person is out of luck, and, therefore, it's inappropriate for us to go on to decide kind of the precise level of substantiality that a machine or transformation must play --",
  "And all we've said is that it might be enough; that is, hard questions will arise down the road as to where do you draw the line, to what extent must the machine or the transformation be central --",
  "I think if it's simply using a calculator for its pre-existing functionality to crunch numbers, very likely that would not be enough. What we see in some analogous areas is that the computer will be programmed with new software. It will be given functionality it didn't have before in order to allow it to perform a series of calculations, and that gets closer to the line. And, again --",
  "Again, we are -- we are not saying it would be patent eligible. We would have to review those facts, and the PTO would have to review those facts in the context of an actual application. I guess the point I'm trying to make is simply that we don't want the court, for instance, in the area of software innovations or medical diagnostic techniques to be trying to use this case as the vehicle for identifying the circumstances in which innovations of that sort would and would not be patent eligible, because the case really doesn't present any -- any question regarding those technologies. And, therefore, we --",
  "I guess I would say a couple of different things. The first is that it seems unlikely, even with new and rapidly emerging technologies, that somebody would come up with a system that seems for patent purposes analogous to the inventions that have been patent eligible in the past that didn't involve any machine and that didn't involve any transformation. Having said that, I would note that in both Benson and in Flook, the Court held open the possibility that some unforeseen event could take place that would -- as to which the application would be patent eligible, even though the machine-or-transformation test --",
  "Well, I think the Court could say -- could do essentially what was done in Benson and Flook, namely acknowledge that there had never been a case up to this point in which a process had been held patent eligible that didn't involve a machine or a transformation. It could leave open the possibility that some new and as yet unforeseen technology could necessitate the creation of an exception. But -- and the point we would also make is this seems to be a very unlikely candidate for such an exception, because the hedging method that Petitioners have -- for which they have sought a patent is in no sense different in kind from risk management techniques that have been undertaken for centuries.",
  "Well, this may or may not be a novel or nonobvious method. But even if we assume that this is nonobvious for purposes of section 103, in that it represents a sufficient advance over the prior art, that people skilled in the art would not necessarily have come up with it, it still is a different in kind from risk management techniques that have taken place in this country for -- for 200 years. It is -- it is -–",
  "The Federal Circuit, sua sponte, set the case for hearing en banc. I believe the case had been argued to a panel, but had not been decided, and the Federal Circuit set the case for reargument en banc, posed a number of questions to the -- the parties and the government did advocate the machine-or-transformation test.",
  "It did. It did advocate the machine-or-transformation.",
  "I don't know that our test -- I think our test, in a sense, has a shorthand version of that. I don't know that focusing the inquiry directly on whether technology is involved would make the inquiry easier, and that is so for two reasons. First, people could dispute whether particular advances are properly regarded as technological advances, and, second, we would still have the difficult problems that the Chief Justice has referred to, where you have a process that is described as involving technology at some step along the way, and courts will still have to make the determination, is that a sufficiently substantial step to make the process, as a whole, a technological one. So I don't think that, by adopting a technological arts test, the Court would avoid the difficulties that it has appropriately identified with the machine-or-transformation test. The other thing I would say about the machine-or-transformation test is this is not a government position of recent vintage; that is, the government's brief to this Court in Gottschalk v. Benson -- or its reply brief, which was filed around 1971 -- basically said, although this Court has never announced machine or transformation of the test, that is the principle that can be abstracted from the totality of the Court's decisions.",
  "It would --",
  "Oh, it would come out the same way. I mean, State Street Bank --",
  "Well, it was machine -- that is, in State Street Bank, the claim was not to a process within the meaning of section 101. The claim was not to a method of accomplishing things by means of a computer, which would be, potentially, a process. It was to the computer itself, the programmed computer, that the innovation in State Street Bank was that the devising of new computer programs that allowed the computer to perform various tasks in association with the carrying out of the hub-and-spokes investment -- investment method. And, certainly --",
  "It didn't transform anything, but it would fit -- the transformation part would be irrelevant because the machine-or-transformation test is, in our view, the appropriate rubric to apply in construing the statutory term process, that is, when the person doesn't say, I have invented a new machine, but, rather, says, I've identified a new process for accomplishing things. If a person claims to be -- to have invented a new machine, then that -- it is either a machine or it isn't. A computer is certainly a machine. Really, the only -- I think the only --",
  "Well, I think what -- the argument that the other side, the person challenging the patent in State Street could have made, but apparently didn't, was the person could have said, of course, the computer is a machine, but a computer programmed with new software to perform different functions is not a new machine. It's not a different machine from the one that has always -- not always, but that has already existed, and therefore, it doesn't satisfy section 1 or section -- 102 or section 103, but that --",
  "It was -- the way I would put it is: The State Street Bank analysis of the question that was actually presented to it was correct; that is, the argued was made the programmed computer is patentable as a machine --",
  "Well, under our test, we would come out the same way because the computer would be a machine. The only question would be whether the programming of the computer with new software caused it to be a patentable different machine from the one that existed previously. Now -- now, we do think that software innovations can have the effect of causing the computer to be a different, special purpose computer, as the phrase –-",
  "I think the same -- the Federal Circuit's decision in State Street would come out the same way under our test.",
  "Yes, but, again, the point I would emphasize --",
  "Well, I guess -- let me backtrack. If you look at the text of the statute –- it’s reproduced at page 2 of the Blue Brief -- and it says -- it's right in the middle of the page. \"Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter is potentially entitled to\" --",
  "I don't -- no. I don’t think that is what I was saying.",
  "What I was saying is that –- and I guess the -- the first point I would make is, when somebody claims to have invented a new machine, the transformation test really has nothing to do with the inquiry because a -- a better television or a better DVD player can be patented as a machine, even though transformation of matter is no --",
  "Well, but my -- I think -- first, I think you can because I think if you -- if you improved the hardware of the computer in order to enable it to perform --",
  "But I -- but I think the argument that has been made with success -- and PTO agrees with this -- is that programming a computer by means of software to produce -- to perform new functions can create a novel --",
  "Well, first of all the only ruling that we're -- I backtrack a bit, to say, we opposed cert in this case because we recognized that there are difficult problems out there in terms of patentability of software innovations and medical diagnostic --",
  "I didn't think you would --",
  "We didn't think the Court would mess it up. We thought that this case would provide an unsuitable vehicle for resolving the hard questions because the case doesn't involve computer software or medical diagnostic techniques, and therefore, we thought the Court would arrive at the position that I think at least some members are feeling that you have arrived at, that you will decide this case, and most of the hard questions remain unresolved. And, frankly, we think that's true.",
  "Again, I don't -- I don't think it would be a bold step to say that machine or transformation is the test. That is, we have gone for more --",
  "And we would -- we would be entirely content with a ruling like that. And we would say that the claimed hedging method here is not the sort of Space Age innovation that might cause Justices to say: This is just different in kind from anything that the drafters of the patent statute could have imagined. The other point I would make about the programmed computer is, to follow up on my television and DVD example, that when you claim a machine or a manufacture, as the committee reports to the 1952 Act said, those words are broad. They encompass everything under the sun that is made by man. And so a television is indisputably a machine, even though its function is not to transform matter. It's only when you get to the term \"process\" that you are left with -- that the machine-or-transformation test kicks in. And really, the argument on the other side is: The term \"process\" in ordinary speech is extremely broad. It can literally be read to encompass any series of steps, whether or not linked to technology, whether or not linked to a machine or transformation. And the other side argues you should construe it that way in the patent statute. I guess the -- the three reasons we would say that's not so are, first, under the canon of noscitur a sociis, it’s appropriate to construe the term \"process\" in conjunction with the other terms. Those other terms are broad, but they all refer to physical objects that don't exist in nature and are created by man. And a huge array of very productive, innovative activity doesn't culminate in the creation of any new physical substance, and the word \"process\" surely was intended to add something, but it would be quite strange to construe the word \"process\" to encompass the whole range of human endeavor when the other words are limited to the creation of new things in the physical. The second thing is that when this Court in the past has explained the term \"process,\" it's always linked it to the operation of machines, as in the telephone cases and in Morse, or to the transformation of matter in ways that may not be dependent on a particular machine. And the third thing I would say is that in a sense, there’s a strong “dog that didn't bark in the night” quality to our argument; that is, even though the Court has never said in so many words that a method of allocating risk by contract is a patent-eligible process, the economic history of this country really would have been fundamentally different if it had been believed from the outset that innovations of this character could be patented and potential competitors could be foreclosed from engaging in the same method. If the Court has nothing further?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: By its terms, section 1658(b)(1) provides that the 2-year period of limitations will commence to run upon discovery of the facts constituting the violation. In isolation, the word \"discovery\" could refer either to actual or constructive discovery. Between the period of the time of this Court's decision in Lampf and the enactment of the new limitations period in 2002, all of the courts of appeals had concluded that constructive discovery would suffice, and we believe that Congress's enactment of the statute tracking that language constitutes acquiescence in that view. Nevertheless, it's noteworthy that the statute refers to facts constituting the violation, and it's absolutely essential to this Court's section 10(b) jurisprudence that can there be no 10(b) violation without scienter. Scienter is an essential element of the offense, and the coverage of section 10(b) would be dramatically expanded if it were read to cover innocent mistakes.",
  "There were certainly frequent references to the concept of inquiry notice. There was not uniformity among the courts of appeals as to precisely what role inquiry notice would play in the analysis. The majority of the courts of appeals believed as we believe that inquiry notice is a subsidiary step along the way to determining when a reasonable plaintiff would have actually discovered the facts constituting the violation. And so you look first to see when would a reasonable person have become suspicious, and then you ask: Once the reasonable person's suspicions were aroused, how long would it take to complete the investigation and have actual knowledge? And that’s consistent with our view. There certainly were courts that adopted Petitioners' view that the statute began to run at the time of inquiry notice, at the time suspicions were aroused.",
  "Well, I think it is -- I think you are right that that is the ultimate question for the Court: When would a reasonably diligent person have obtained actual knowledge? The concept of inquiry notice can be a useful subsidiary step, because even once it has been established -- for instance, there are many cases of this Court in which the plaintiff's failure to exercise reasonable diligence consisted of the failure to look at documents that were available in public records offices or corporate records that were open for inspection. And in that situation, once you identify the point at which a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have commenced to look, there won't be a very long gap in time before the reasonably diligent plaintiff would have found what he was looking for. And in that situation, it's really integral to identify the point of inquiry notice, the point at which the plaintiff would have started looking. Now, the fact that inquiry notice is not the be-all and end-all shouldn't be surprising, because it's a term that doesn't appear in the statute. And so the fact that it ultimately plays a subsidiary role in undertaking the ultimate --",
  "Yes, we -- under our --",
  "Under our standard, the -- the individual would have knowledge of facts constituting the violation once he had facts sufficient that if -- if alleged in a complaint, they would survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.",
  "They would establish --",
  "That's correct. And --",
  "That's correct. There certainly would be --",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, inquiry notice is -- in many instances, identifying the point of inquiry notice is often essential to identifying the point at which a reasonable person would have discovered the facts that would support a well-pleaded complaint.",
  "For instance, suppose it was common ground that there were records available in an admittedly obscure public records office, and that a plaintiff, once he started to conduct an investigation, would find those records within a week. We still wouldn't know the point at which a reasonably diligent plaintiff should have found those records until we could first determine when would a reasonably diligent plaintiff have started looking, and that would be the point of inquiry notice. And so, it might be that at a certain point, the plaintiff had --",
  "That's correct, but we -- again, knowing only that the records would have taken a week to be discovered once the plaintiff started looking, wouldn't tell you when a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have found those records, unless you also knew the date on which the reasonably diligent plaintiff would have begun his investigation.",
  "Yes.",
  "I think typically in a fraud- -on-the-market case, inquiry notice will really tell us nothing meaningful --",
  "-- because the whole premise of the case is the market as a whole was defrauded. Certainly, a reasonably diligent investigation –-",
  "I think we should ask: When would a reasonably diligent investor have discovered sufficient facts to file a well-pleaded complaint? Now, constructive discovery does still play a role, because if there was information in the public domain, but a particular investor simply didn't read news reports, didn't follow even public information about the -- the nature of what was going on with Vioxx, that person wouldn't be shielded from the running of the limitations period simply because he didn't have actual knowledge.",
  "And I think if you read Tellabs as a construction of this statute, it would be inconsistent with our view. But the Tellabs Court was talking about something else. It was construing the heightened pleading requirements of the PSLRA. Now, the PSLRA pleading requirements do distinguish, in adjacent subsections, between the requirement that a plaintiff plead with particularity the specific statements that are alleged to be false or misleading and the reason that they are false and misleading, on the one hand -- that’s in subsection (1) -- and then, in subsection (2), it requires also to be pleaded with particularity the facts that establish strong inference of scienter. And the Court in Tellabs used the term \"facts constituting the violation\" as a shorthand reference to that subsection (1); namely, you have to plead with particularity facts about the alleged misstatement and why it’s misleading. The statute itself, the PSLRA, does not use the term \"facts constituting the violation\" to describe the first category. And the word \"violation\" as applied to 10(b) naturally encompasses both what the defendant did and what his state of mind was. The other thing we would say -- two other things we would say in that regard are, first, as the introductory language of section 1658(b) points out, this limitations period only applies to suits in which the plaintiff alleges misconduct involving fraud, deceit, manipulation, or contrivance. And so, the limitations period is limited to violations that have scienter as an element. And, therefore, it would be particularly peculiar to think of a violation as not encompassing the fact of scienter. The other thing we would say -- and Justice Scalia was asking earlier about the differences between 78i(e) and 77m -- and there are really too salient differences. The first is that 77m is explicit in providing that constructive as well as actual discovery will suffice. And we think that 1658(b)(1) is properly read to encompass constructive discovery, even though it doesn't say so in so many words. But the other salient difference is that the period in 77m doesn't commence to run by its terms upon discovery of the violation or the facts constituting the violation. The statute says discovery of the false or misleading statement or omission. That's natural in 77m, because 77m deals with violations that don't have scienter as an element. But if this Court had incorporated that language, it would have given the impression that knowledge of scienter was not sufficient -- was not required.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think that by focusing on a rather mundane aspect of the NFL commissioner's powers, this may help to explain why the United States is not four-square in support of either party's theory in this case. Among the powers that is vested in the commissioner by the NFL -- by the NFL constitution is the power to incur expenses to carry on the ordinary business of the league, and this includes renting office space, hiring employees, and procuring supplies. And if the commissioner, pursuant to that delegation of authority, decides from which company he's going to -- to acquire paper for the league's offices or decides what the wage scale for secretaries in the league offices should be, our view is that that's the conduct of a single entity. It may be that the commissioner's power to do those things is ultimately derived from the consent of the individual teams within the league, but once that consent has been given, once that authority has been centralized, then the commissioner's decision about a paper supplier or wages for employees --",
  "I guess we would say two things: The first is, up to now there has been no such thing in the law as concerted action that is per se legal or per se reasonable.",
  "I guess my point is that if, for instance, a disappointed bidder for the paper supply conduct -- contract challenged this as a section 1 violation and said the commissioner's decision to go to Staples rather than Office Depot was unreasonable --",
  "-- because Office Depot was offering a better product at a lower price -- that there are certainly decisions that the commissioner could make with respect to procurement of supplies or the setting of wage levels that would be unreasonable in a business judgment sense, in that they wouldn't effectively carry on the mission of the organization, but they wouldn't be unreasonable in the -- the section 1 sense. And the other thing I would say is that line of argument could have been made in Copperweld; that is, the Court could have concluded that --",
  "Well -- well, in Dagher, for instance, the Court was dealing with a situation that's in some ways analogous to the one that you have here; that is, a joint venture in which entities that were economic competitors in some aspects of their businesses joined forces with respect to other aspects. And the Court in Dagher didn't squarely resolve these questions, whether section 1 applied, but it said that in pricing its products, Equilon, the joint venture, was acting as a single firm, a single entity. The other point I would like to make about my -- my paper and employee example is that, in our view, the NFL commissioner, when carrying out those functions on behalf of the league, would be acting as a single entity, even though his power was derived from the consent of the teams. But if the Jets and the Giants agreed among themselves as to what wages they would pay their secretaries or from whom they would buy paper, that would be an entirely different thing. The fact that those teams are for some purposes part of a --",
  "I think the section -- the question of whether section 1 applied would not be any different; that is, the central section 1 that --",
  "It -- it may not be a red herring with respect to the ultimate resolution of the case; that is, if the court on -- the lower court, on remand, if the case were remanded, applied rule of reason analysis, the -- the precise nature of the contract might bear on whether the restraint was reasonable, but it wouldn't bear on the question of whether concerted activity was involved; that is, what --",
  "I guess my point was, once -- once the teams decided that they would -- rather than each negotiating individually, either with a single licensee or with multiple licensees, once they decided they would negotiate as a collective and that any potential licensee had to go to the collective rather than to the individual teams, that's the central section 1 issue. And if the -- the collective had decided, we will give contracts to a multitude of potential bidders, that would not have affected the fact that concerted action was involved.",
  "That would -- that initial delegation of authority would be subject to a section 1 challenge, because that would be concerted action in the same way that the Court in Dagher said --",
  "Because that -- that occurs after the point at which the commissioner has been vested with that authority. If somehow a plaintiff wanted to say there was an -- there was illicit concerted action when the teams agreed to give the commissioner this general power, that would be subject to section 1 review. It seems -- because that would be concerted action. It seems highly unlikely that such a challenge would prevail. But if --",
  "This only applies to carrying out the ordinary business of the league. It -- it would only apply to the commissioner's running of -- of the league office, not the running of the individual teams. And as I say, our central point is that --",
  "I guess under our theory, we would first ask, as to an entity like this, which is entities that compete in some respects with --",
  "I think we would ask first: Is -- is the commissioner acting as a single entity when he exercises delegated authority in making a business judgment about which supplier to buy paper or what the wages should be? If the answer is yes, then the section 1 inquiry is over, then the case is no different from a challenge to the --",
  "Well, I think if a single business is deciding whether to buy paper from one supplier or from several, that wouldn't be subject to section 1 review, because the decision of the single business might affect the welfare of the competitors, but it wouldn't be concerted action. And our point is that when -- I think the way in which our position differs from that of the two parties is that on the one hand, I think it is the logical implication of Petitioner's position that because the commissioner's authority to buy supplies for the league or hire referees for the league is ultimately derived from the consent of the individual teams who are independently owned, the logic of Petitioner's position suggests that that would be subject to section 1 scrutiny. On the other hand, the logic of the NFL's position suggests that because the commissioner can set price, can decide from whom to buy paper on behalf of the league, the Jets and the Giants could reach a similar agreement, and the -- or the Jets and the Giants could agree on the prices they will pay secretaries --",
  "I think that follows logically from the position that this is one entity. Because in Copperweld, for instance, the Court noted that coordination between different divisions of a single company would not be subject to section 1 scrutiny, and that implies not just that all the divisions could get together, but that any two could confer among themselves without raising section 1 concerns.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I’d like first to address briefly Justice Alito's question about the length of time that the agency anticipates the EIS will take. The agency now anticipates that its best estimate is that the EIS will be ready approximately a year from now. A draft EIS has been submitted for public comment. The public comment period was extended until early March of 2010. The agency has received on the order of 145,000 public comments. And, so, in addition to parsing through those and seeing which of them need to be responded to, the agency wants to consult with other Federal agencies. And, so this process is going to take longer than APHIS had anticipated at the outset. Now, we said in our brief in opposition that the fact that the EIS process was ongoing was a reason for this Court to deny certiorari. I think regardless of how good an argument that was at the cert stage, the Court has granted cert, and we think that the Court should decide the case. There’s no realistic prospect that the case will become moot before this Court's decision is rendered.",
  "That's correct.",
  "When the district court issued its summary judgment ruling, it asked the parties to propose their own forms of a judgment. And APHIS might have done what the Chief Justice suggested ought to have been done; that is, it might have indicated that the court -- that either it should simply issue a declaratory judgment or that it should vacate the deregulation order, and the matter would have been remanded to the agency to decide what to do next. And if that had happened, the agency could then have issued an administrative order that embodied the same proposed conditions that were embodied in the injunction. Presumably, the plaintiffs would have challenged that, and we would have had a new lawsuit. Now, what APHIS tried to do, in essence, was to streamline the process by combining into one steps that could otherwise have been taken separately. And it proposed an injunction that said the deregulation decision is vacated and replaced by the following protective conditions.",
  "I don't think it would have been our burden; that is, if the -- if the order had simply been -- the deregulation order had simply been vacated and remanded to the agency, and the agency had then performed the analysis that’s reflected in the Hoffman declarations and said we are putting in place a complete deregulation --",
  "Agencies can do that. And it -- on review of that, it would not have been our burden to establish that those --",
  "I think in the ordinary course, you’re absolutely correct. And in the usual case, it's an important principle to us that the court should not usurp the agency's role. Here I think, in fairness to the district court, if the court had issued the injunction we proposed with the protective measures that were reflected in the government's proposed judgment, the court would not have been usurping the agency's role, because it would have been adopting the very protective measures that the agency identified as appropriate. So we think that the district --",
  "Well, it is certainly acting with the benefit of whatever information it received in the form of public comment in its original environmental assessment for the complete deregulation. And in addition, the district court, in deciding whether the agency's proposed conditions would have been appropriate could have entertained comments from obviously the Respondents and from anyone else who wanted to intervene. But to go back to Justice Sotomayor's --",
  "Our view is that, first, that we would not have had to go through public notice and comment, because, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(2), there is an exception for good cause, and here the relatively limited timeframe that we were talking about in our view would have constituted good cause. Obviously, the plaintiffs might have challenged that. Now, we would have had to perform some sort of environmental analysis to comply with our NEPA obligations in order to feel sufficient confident -- confidence that implementation of our proposed measures would not cause significant environmental impacts. It wouldn't have had to be an EIS; that is, NEPA provides, in appropriate circumstances --",
  "I think that's -- it is correct to say that, as a matter of the statute and the regulations, an agency cannot decide to prepare an EIS on a particular act, decision, and then implement that very decision during the pendency of the EIS.",
  "But our -- our core point here is that what we were proposing for the interim, that is allowing continued planting subject to various protective measures, was fundamentally different from the action on which the EIS was being prepared. That is --",
  "You are correct. And we are not asserting the right to implement the deregulation decision; that is, the decision removing all Federal constraints from the planting and harvesting of RRA. We’re not asserting the right to do that during the pendency of the EIS process. The CEQ regulations speak to this question, and they don't say while an EIS is ongoing, no activity related to the action for which the EIS is being prepared may go forward. They say in the interim the agency can't do things that will have an adverse environmental impact or will foreclose reasonable alternatives. So, what the agency might have done at the outset was say: We need to do an EIS before implementing a complete deregulation decision. The effects of doing that are at least potentially sufficiently great that an EIS is being prepared. However, we feel confident that interim planting during this limited period, subject to these proposed protective measures, will not have adverse environmental impact --",
  "I hope I didn't misunderstand the question. If you’re referring to the types of activities that would have been prohibited even under our proposed injunction; that --",
  "No, I think in order for the -- the plaintiffs to get an injunction against those, they would have had to meet --",
  "Well, I think if this had happened through the alternative events -- course of events that I discussed previously; that is, if the matter had been remanded back to the agency and the agency had issued an administrative order that embodied these proposed protective conditions, then the plaintiffs would presumably have either filed a new lawsuit or challenged this within the confines of this suit. The burden would have been on them to show both that those protective measures were --",
  "Well, I think --",
  "Well, all that the court had decided up to the point when we submitted our proposed judgment was that an EIS was needed before the agency could implement complete deregulation. And I think in this respect the case is similar to Winter; that is, in Winter in the district court -- the district court initially imposed six restrictive measures on the Navy, and the Navy elected not to challenge four of them but challenged the other two. I suppose that the Navy could have asked for, in a sense, vacatur of its proposed action and then announced a new action that consisted of compliance with the four unchallenged restrictive measures and noncompliance with the other two. From our perspective, rather than short-circuiting the process, as I say, we were trying to streamline it; that is, the court could have sent it back to us, we could have told it what protective measures were appropriate, and then some months later we would have been back in court to review the adequacy of those, particularly because we thought of the -- any injunction as being something that would stay in effect only for the relatively limited period of time while the EIS was being prepared. We tried to speed up the process by telling the court in advance these are the protective measures we think are appropriate without the need for a remand. And the court's fundamental error was in equating what we had proposed with the complete deregulation that was the subject of the lawsuit. I think that the -- the agency's declarations explained why the protective measures that were embodied in the government's proposed injunction would have been fully sufficient to prevent irreparable harm to the plaintiffs during the pendency of the EIS.",
  "That's the legal error we identify. We also think that the district court did, without quite using these words, announce a presumption in favor of injunctive relief; that is, the district court said, wrongly in our view, that it couldn't assess the adequacy of the proposed protective measures because that would duplicate the analysis that was going on in the EIS. We think that was --",
  "I think the district court could have done that and, as I say, if -- if the --",
  "If it --",
  "It didn't just say that. In its judgment, which I believe is at page 108a of the petition appendix -- and Mr. Garre referred to this previously -- it said in addition that the agency is enjoined from deregulating even in part genetically engineered alfalfa. So the district court didn't simply vacate the -- the deregulation order and send it back to the agency to decide whether some interim protective measures would be appropriate. It said the agency can't do anything while the EIS is being prepared to allow the planting or harvesting of RRA except to the limited extent that the district court was authorizing with respect to already planted alfalfa.",
  "Yes, I think -- yes, I think absolutely. Because the fundamental controversy both in the court of appeals and in this Court has been not whether an injunction should have been entered at all. For better or for worse, I think both the Petitioners and the government have acquiesced in the entry of some form of injunction. The controversy has been, should the district court have entered the government's proposed injunction instead of the one that it actually entered? And clearly if the proposed injunction had been entered instead, the Petitioners would have been better off because there would have been a continued market for their seed to planters who wanted to grow RRA in compliance with the proposed protective measures.",
  "I'm not sure to what extent the Petitioners or -- or the government, frankly, have focused precisely on that particular language of the district court's judgment. But it has certainly been kind of the fundamental basis for our appeal to the court of appeals and for Petitioners' appeal and certiorari petition that what they are complaining about was the fact that a complete injunction was put in place, instead of an injunction that embodied the government's proposed protective measures, and we were focusing on the choice between two injunctions. We didn't focus specifically on the alternative course of action in which the matter might have been sent back to the agency and the agency would then have embodied those proposed protective measures in an administrative order. But I think the issue whether those protective measures would have been sufficient to prevent irreparable harm to the plaintiffs has been preserved throughout. Just to say one more thing about the CEQ regulations, this Court has held in the past that those are entitled to deference, and, again, they don't preclude all action during the pendency of the EIS.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If the government's interpretation of section 109(a) is a little bit different from either of the parties, since I want to make clear precisely what it is, in our view, the words \"lawfully made under this title\" mean made subject to and in accordance with Title 17. And because the Copyright Act doesn't apply abroad, in order for a copy to be made subject to Title 17, it would have to be created in the United States. Now, I think our interpretation of the statute still gives it a slightly different meaning from the alternative \"lawfully made in the United States,\" because at least in theory, it would be possible for the creation of a copy to entail a violation of environmental laws, workplace safety laws, minimum wage laws, et cetera. And it wouldn't be accurate to characterize a copy made in that way as lawfully made in the United States, but it would be made -- it would be lawfully made under this title, because it would be made subject to and in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Copyright Act. Now, with respect to the types of copyright materials at issue here, the watches are clearly very different from what Congress had in mind when it enacted section 602(a)(1). But in other respects, what Omega was trying to do in this case was exactly what Congress intended to allow when it expanded the importation provisions beyond restrictions on importation of radical copies. The ideal was to allow a copyright owner to segment markets either to give -- either retain for itself or to give to another entity exclusive rights within the United States, but give other rights abroad to other producers. And consequently, we argued in Quality King and we are arguing here that the Court should construe section 109(a) in a way that doesn't prevent section 602(a) from performing that function. And the Court in Quality King grappled with the question of whether applying the -- section 109(a) to the labels that were at issue in that case would have the effect of negating 602(a)(1) and the Court said no it wouldn't, because section 109(a) applies only to copies that are lawfully made under this title. And the Court specially said it wouldn't apply to copies that were made -- lawfully made under the law of the foreign country. Now, the Court didn't refer specifically to the place of manufacture. In giving the example of the British publisher who would be creating copies under the law of Great Britain, it didn't specifically say that's because British law would apply when the copies are made in England. But I think that's the necessary inference, because the Court's analysis made quite clear that it viewed a particular copy as being lawfully made under the law of one and only one question -­",
  "Well, I think there are -- I think we would say a couple of things. The question has been raised whether this gives favored status to a foreign manufactured goods. And in one sense our reading -- from -- from the perspective of the copyright owner, it's true, that this creates something of potential incentive to manufacture abroad. Now, from the perspective of the potential importer, you could say this makes foreign manufactured goods disfavored because they were harder to get into the country than would be the case if they had been manufactured within the United States and had then been sent abroad and -- and reimported. I guess the best we can say about the treatment from the copyright owners' prospective, the differential treatment of foreign and domestic manufactured goods is that at least with respect to goods that were made within the United States, the copyright owner has exercised rights under United States law. He has -- it has exercised its exclusive right to produce the copies in the first instance, whereas the manufacturer in Omega's position by creating and then selling the watches abroad, never exercised any of its Title 17 rights. And the theory underlying the first sale doctrine tracing it back to -- to Bobbs-Merrill, the first articulation by this Court of the -- the doctrine of the copyright context, the theory is that a copyright owner who sells the goods, places them in the stream of commerce, has exercised, as the Court put it in Bobbs-Merrill, its exclusive right to vend, and therefore it can claim no more rights under the copyright laws. Omega with respect to the watches at issue here, never exercised any its rights under title 17, not -- not when the watches were made and not when they were sold. I do also want to address the question of what happens in the circumstance where Omega manufactures watches abroad, but then voluntarily imports them into the United States, sells them here; can it place restrictions on resale because I think it's an important policy question and here again we get to the same point in the end as the Respondents do, but we have a somewhat different textual route to get there. Our view is that in that circumstance section 109(a) still would not apply, because even though the goods were imported into the United States, they were made abroad, and that's what counts for determining whether they were lawfully made under this title. But section 109(a) is simply a safe harbor. It doesn't prohibit anything. Section 109(a) says if your conduct falls within these contours then what you are doing is legal, whether or not it would otherwise violate the copyright act. But if there is a dispute as to whether section 109(a) applies, and a court held that it doesn't, the consequence is not necessarily that the conduct is unlawful. The consequence is that you look to other provisions of title 17 to see whether it is lawful or not.",
  "I think we would say the first sale doctrine as articulated in Bobbs-Merrill would operate, but we wouldn't place this within section 109(a).",
  "I think we would still be looking to other provisions of the Copyright Act rather than to common law. That is, in the hypothetical I describe, clearly there could be no violation of 602(a)(1), because the copies would have been imported by Omega itself. And so the question is if Omega sells them within the United States and the buyer attempts to resell them, would that be an infringement of Omega 17's rights? And the only claim that Omega could -- I mean that -- Omega could plausibly make in that circumstance would be to say, that is a violation of my exclusive right to distribute copies to the public protected by section 106(3). And I think the response would be under Bobbs-Merrill, the Court already held that once the copyright owner exercised its exclusive right to vend -­ the word which appeared at the statute at the time -­ once it had exercised its exclusive right to vend the copies, it was done with them and had no more rights to assert. And there is no reason to give the right to vend -- the right to distribute under the current law a broader reading than the right to vend had at that time, simply because Congress has enacted section 109. And -- so I think that the -- it would still be the case that in order to prevail in a copyright suit, Omega would have to show that not only that section 109 was inapplicable, but there was a violation of the exclusive rights and I don't think it would be able to do that here. Now in Bobbs-Merrill, the Court was certainly drawing on common law principles but it said in the end, its words: \"This is exclusively a question of statutory interpretation.\" It -- it based its holding on the language of the Copyright Act as it existed at that time, specifically the exclusive right to vend; and the exclusive right to distribute copies to the public is no different for these purposes under the current statute.",
  "I -- I think with -- with respect to the pre-emption question, what they had in mind was a situation in which Omega sells the watch to a reseller -- to a retailer on condition, for instance, that the retailer only sell them in a particular way, or do particular types of advertising, and the reseller sells them in violation.",
  "Exactly. I think the language was chosen in part at least to make clear that although Omega under in that hypothetical circumstance would have no remedy under the Copyright Act, it might potentially have a breach of contract suit against the retailer if the retailer had breached the agreement with Omega, and that nothing was -- in the Federal law was intended to preempt the State law contractual remedies that would otherwise be available. And I think the language adequately accomplishes that purpose.",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "Well, I think -­",
  "I think in 1960 -- may I?",
  "Because many of the people with which Congress were concerned would not be in privity of contract with the U.S. copyright owner.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I -- I'd like to begin by addressing Justice Scalia's question about the -- what's sometimes referred to as the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, whether it's appropriate to place a person in a position where he has to make a choice whether to assert one of two constitutional rights. And although there is in many contexts reluctance to put an individual to that choice, there's not an inflexible rule against it. And to take one example, a criminal defendant has an absolute constitutional right to testify in his own defense. He also has an absolute constitutional right to resist compelled testimony in which the prosecution will ask him hostile questions, but he doesn't have a constitutional right to do both. If he chooses -- chooses to take the stand and testify, he may be cross-examined at trial by the prosecution, and he has no residual Fifth Amendment right to resist the hostile questioning.",
  "Well, I don't know that it's more fundamental than the right not to be questioned against one's will in a criminal proceeding in which you're -­",
  "I guess there are two potential objections to the use of a non-Article III judge, and one of them would be, as you say, structural; that is, one of the objections that is sometimes made to the use of non-Article III adjudicators is that if Congress can parcel out part of the work of the judiciary to other units, the stature of the judicial branch will be diminished. I think this particular statute doesn't create that risk, because the use of bankruptcy judges is entirely under the control of the district judges; that is, the district court decides whether to refer a bankruptcy case to the bankruptcy judge; the district court can withdraw the referral with respect to particular proceedings.",
  "Well, to the extent that the concern is with fairness to individual litigants, that is, the idea that the Respondent in this case has a right to an Article III tribunal and should not likely be held to have waived it, I think that a person who seeks affirmative relief from a court doesn't waive all his constitutional rights, to be sure, but should ordinarily be taken to accept the consequences that ordinarily follow from a request for judicial relief. And as a matter of history and tradition, one of the consequences that follows from the assertion of an affirmative claim is subjection to counterclaims, and especially compulsory counterclaims.",
  "Well, the Court has applied this basic principle in a number of contexts. That is, in McElrath v. United States, which is cited in the Petitioner's brief, the plaintiff filed suit against the United States in the Court of Claims, and the United States then asserted counterclaims against him, and the original plaintiff said that he had a -- a right to jury trial under the Seventh Amendment.",

  "Another example would be Adam v. Saenger, which is also cited in the Petitioner's brief, in which I believe it was a Texas plaintiff filed suit in the California State courts, and the California defendant asserted a -- a cross-complaint, basically a counterclaim, against him, and the Texas plaintiff objected to the California court's assertion of personal jurisdiction. And this Court said: By seeking affirmative relief from the California court, you have subjected yourself to the jurisdiction of that court for all purposes for which justice requires. And it said the State can make that the price it pays for seeking affirmative judicial relief in its courts. Now, it may have -­",
  "Well -­",
  "Well, let me step back a second and address the questions that were posed by Justices Sotomayor and Alito at the -- at the beginning about the initial authority of the bankruptcy judge to adjudicate the claim brought against the estate, because I agree with my colleague's answer that this is a question -- and with Justice Sotomayor, that this is a question that this Court hasn't squarely resolved. Now, it's true that the initial -- that the State law claim, the defamation claim that was made the basis for the claim against the estate, was a State law cause of action. But as this Court said in Katchen v. Landy, the effect of the commencement of the bankruptcy case is to convert the claimant's potential legal claim against the defendant into an equitable claim against the estate. And Respondent's equitable claim against the estate seeking a share of the assets was a claim created by Federal law. That is, it's true that in the course of deciding whether Respondent was ultimately entitled to a share of the estate, the bankruptcy court would have been required to adjudicate State law questions and conduct something like the same proceedings that could have arisen in a State case, but actually obtaining a share of the bankruptcy estate requires more than that there be a valid debt. The whole point of bankruptcy is to deal with situations in which the debtor doesn't have enough assets to go around, and so the bankruptcy court will have to not only determine whether a valid debt exists, but what are the relative priorities of various creditors, what is the appropriate pro rata share for a particular claimant, and all of that is to be resolved under Federal law. So, when Respondent filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy case, it was asserting a Federal right cognizable under the Bankruptcy Code. And, again, none of the -- none of the analogues that I've identified are precisely analogous to this one, but I think it's noteworthy that Respondent cites no contrary authority from this Court. That is, Respondent cites no case in which a claimant has invoked the authority of a particular court and has asked for affirmative relief, and this Court has held that it nevertheless had a constitutional entitlement to be free of counterclaims. And that seems particularly true of compulsory counterclaims, both because they are counterclaims that our legal system affirmatively encourages to be brought within the same proceeding and for the reason that Justice Ginsburg said, that in an analogous area of the law, when we ask whether there is Federal court jurisdiction over a counterclaim to begin with, if the counterclaim is compulsory, there need be no independent basis for jurisdiction. I'd like to address quickly the statutory question, and the relevant provisions begin at page 1a of the Government's brief.",
  "I think the 157(b)(5) is, in our view, not jurisdictional. It deals with the -- the respective authorities of the bankruptcy judge and the district court within the bankruptcy case, but it doesn't go to the question of what the -- the Federal courts can adjudicate and the limitations on bankruptcy court authority are waivable and subject to consent. The court of appeals did not address the personal injury aspect of the case. There is a -- a lively dispute between the parties as to whether that objection to bankruptcy court adjudication was properly preserved, and that would be open to the court of appeals on remand if this Court were to reverse. On page 1a -­",
  "I think -- yes, I mean, this could have been a prudential factor that might have persuaded the Court not to grant certiorari in the first instance, but the Court has obviously identified this as an issue that warrants the expenditure of its resources. And we think that the -- there is no jurisdictional impediment to a decision in this case.",
  "Again, we don't have a position with respect to the defamation claim. That is, defamation claims may be personal injury claims in many contexts, but in this statute, it's linked with wrongful death, which seems to -- to cut the other way. The actual counterclaim was not a defamation claim; it was a tortious interference claim. And we don't think that would be a personal injury claim. With respect to (b)(1), it says bankruptcy -- I see my time is up. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As the Chief Justice's question suggests, although Stanford and the government's interests are aligned in this case, that won't invariably be so, and the government has perhaps different reasons for supporting the same position that Stanford is supporting.",
  "The government-wide regulation that -- which was promulgated by the Department of Commerce and which identifies certain things that should be in the funding agreements, it does not require an assignment of title from the university's employees. The regulation does require the university to make assurance -- give assurances that it has contractual obligations from its employees to cooperate in filing the documents necessary to process a completed patent application. But that would be necessary -­",
  "Well, under our theory -­ first, under our theory it wouldn't be necessary, because the statute itself would give the university title. And second, under Respondent's theory I think there is a substantial doubt whether it would be permissible. That is, Respondent's vision of the Bayh-Dole Act is that Congress imposed elaborate requirements on inventions as to which the contractor has obtained title from the researcher, but that Congress left entirely to private ordering, was indifferent as to whether the contractor took title in the first instance. And if that view of the statute were accepted, there would at least be a substantial doubt whether the Commerce Department could promulgate regulations that would validly require the contractor to do something that, in Respondent's view, Congress left to private ordering. Now, I don't want to argue that point too vigorously, because certainly, if this Court holds that assignments from the inventors are required, we would like to have the opportunity to require the contractor to get them, but it isn't clear to me how you would get there if Respondent's view of the statute were accepted.",
  "We would certainly like to have the opportunity to do that, but to use an analogy, the Bayh-Dole Act is triggered by voluntary choices of small businesses and nonprofits to accept Federal funds.",
  "If -- certainly if this Court, as I say, holds that the -- an assignment from the inventor is required, then we would like to be able to have regulations that would require that to be done. As I say -­",
  "Well, typically it would -- it would certainly have to identify the inventors on the patent application, and typically the university would -- whether it felt an assignment was legally required or not, it would attempt to -­",
  "It would -­",
  "Not -- in most cases, but not necessarily. There's a provision of the Patent Act, 35 U.S.C. 118, which says that if an inventor refuses to execute an assignment or cannot be found after reasonable diligence, a person to whom the patent application has been assigned or to whom the inventor has promised to assign it, or some other person with a sufficient proprietary interest in the invention, can file its own patent application. It will identify the inventor as the inventor, and it will provide documentation that establishes its own interest in the invention. And this is the kind of thing that we might in some instances have to do with respect to Federal employees. That is, there's an executive order that says basically as a condition of Federal employment, if you conceive -- if you create or conceive an invention on the job, it -- the Federal Government is entitled to take title to it.",
  "It could be a -- I mean, there are two different things. It could be a promise to assign at the formation of the employment arrangement, where the employee is not -- doesn't necessarily have in mind any particular invention, but he exercises a contractual commitment to assign to the -- to the employer at a later date.",

  "Leaving aside the question of whether that is right or wrong is a matter of contract law, our view is it was not within Stanford's power to essentially convey to the inventor or allow the inventor to retain title, and that's clear in a couple of different respects.

The one -­",
  "I think there are probably a lot of universities that use this language, and indeed, as one of the amicus briefs points out, it's very natural to distinguish between a present assignment and a promise to assign in the future with respect to an invention that now exists. It seems a little ethereal to distinguish between a present assignment of an invention that has not yet been created and an agreement to assign that in the future. Now, certainly universities could change their contracts if that was what was necessary. I think one of the concerns that the government has, and this was hinted at by the Chief Justice's question, is that we're -- we're worried not just about what can be done to universities, but what universities could do to us. That is, it's standard university practice to say employees agree to assign their inventions to the university, and the two parties will divide the royalties; and if that is done, then even under Respondent's view it becomes a subject invention; and the university's commercialization of the invention is subject to all the requirements of Bayh-Dole. The government -­",
  "Right.",
  "-- well, the -- the NIH document is internally inconsistent, because it says at the beginning that title passes automatically to the university, but then, as you say, it states later on that an assignment is required, but that the contractor is required to get it. And I think some people have proceeded on that assumption because it never -- so long as assignments were in place and were enforceable, it never really mattered whether they were needed. But to continue my answer to Justice Kagan, I wanted to point out, under Respondent's theory, universities could make a conscious, calculated decision that, rather than obtain an assignment for their inventors, they would simply agree with the inventor that royalties would be split in -- in the same manner as previously, but that the inventor would retain title and, perhaps with the assistance of the university's technology transfer office, would negotiate with commercial entities. And the effect would be to contract around Bayh-Dole; commercialization could occur without complying with any of the prerequisites.",
  "Justice Scalia, and may it please the Court: I would like to begin by addressing briefly this Court's decision in RCA, because I think it's important to notice not only that Justice Cardozo used fulsome and extensive language that was intended to sweep broadly and that was intended to announce a categorical rule; the other thing is the discussion in RCA was intended and was set forward as a recapitulation of prior doctrine. That is, Justice Scalia -- Justice Cardozo did not purport to announce for the first time a rule as to the weight that should be given a prior patenting decision. He explained that this is what the Court had done since the latter part of the 19th century and in fact it had been done by Justice Story riding circuit in the early part of the 19th century. And the court in RCA said a patent is presumed to be valid until the presumption has been overcome by convincing evidence of error. The requirement of heightened proof was part and parcel of the presumption itself in the same way that I think most lawyers in this country would say that the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is part and parcel of the presumption of innocence in criminal cases. If a new criminal statute were enacted saying that the defendant is presumed innocent, but the presumption can be overcome by a preponderance of the evidence, that might be a presumption of innocence, but it wouldn't be the presumption of innocence as it's historically been understood in our country. The second thing I would say about Congress's presumed intent when it acted in 1952 was that, at least when this Court's precedents are clear, Congress when it uses words that come right from those cases should be presumed to have codified this Court's holdings, not the decisions of lower courts that may have deviated from this Court's instructions. And I think the presumption that Congress acts against the background of existing law, it's less a prediction or an assessment of what percentage of the legislature were actually aware of the details of RCA. It's more a method of making the system work, by telling conscientious legislators: If you do read up, if you do understand the contours of Supreme Court's decisions, you can be confident that your words will be -­",
  "I think there is a belt and suspenders quality to the statute, no matter how you parse it, but I think that Microsoft has essentially the same problem, because they have constructed a theory under which the second sentence does something that the first has not, does not, but they haven't constructed any theory as to why the first sentence is not superfluous. That is, given the second sentence to the effect that the burden of establishing invalidity is on the challenger, there's no more work to be done by the first sentence. The other thing I would say in response to Justice Alito's question, which also goes to the natural meaning of the statute, Justice Alito asked, I think, basically, if these precedents were not on the book and we were just looking fresh at the language, what would we assume the standard to be? And I think we would say, let's look at what the defendant is asking the judge or jury to do. The defendant is asking the judge or jury to set aside a decision that has been made by then the Patent Office, now the PTO, and we would ask what sort of standard of proof ordinarily applies when a litigant asks a court to set aside an administrative decision. In a sense, this court had a variant of that problem a few years ago in Dickinson v. Zurko, which dealt with direct court of appeals review of a denial by the PTO of a patent applicant's application, and the statute clearly authorized judicial review in the Federal Circuit, but said nothing about what standard would apply. And the Court said in the absence of a conflicting standard imposed by the statute, we will look to background principles and administrative law, and the standard will be substantial evidence. And that's basically what this Court said back in 1894 in Morgan v. Daniels. It said the reason that we apply a heightened standard when an individual attacks the validity of an issued patent is that that litigant is asking the Court to set aside a decision made by the appropriate executive branch agency.",
  "I think you are correct that if Congress had focused specifically on the category of cases in which the only evidence brought forward to show invalidity had not been considered by the PTO, it might have addressed that separately. In our view there are three independent reasons that it makes sense to apply a heightened standard even in that category of cases. The first two have to do with the interests of the patent applicant, the third has to do with the interests of the PTO. The first one is that the patent -- the grant of a patent has historically been understood to reflect a quid pro quo between the applicant and the government, and the applicant's part of the bargain was disclose that which might otherwise be maintained as a trade secret, and the government's part of the bargain was give a period of exclusivity. And I think there is a thread in this Court's cases, especially in the barbed wire patent cases, to the effect that once the patent applicant has honored his part of the bargain a court should be hesitant to essentially deprive him of the benefit for which he contracted unless the evidence is clear. The court in the barbed wire patent cases said that whatever doubts there may be as to whether the patentee was actually the first inventor should be resolved in the patentee's favor because without question he was the one who first disclosed the information to the public, made it available to the public through the patent application process itself. The second is related to the patentee's reliance interests, but is more instrumental. That is, independent of our concerns for fairness to the patent applicant, Congress could reasonably determine that there are enough uncertainties along the way to getting a patent, to having it overturned on various other grounds that in an invalidity suit the patent -- the patentee should have reasonable confidence that it won't be overturned unless the evidence is clear. And I would like to respond briefly to Your Honor's question, Justice Kagan, about why isn't that diminished by the re-examination process. I think it is diminished somewhat. Re-examination is different both because it's done by the expert agency and because it's more nuanced. There is. The option to narrow the claims to revise the language. It's not a blunderbuss tool, like setting it aside. But I would still acknowledge the force of your observation that to some extent, the patent holder's confidence would be greater if there were no re-examination process at all. And I guess I would say this is just one aspect of the patent law's balancing of competing interests in a way that doesn't serve either to the exclusion of the other; and to use an obvious analogy, the current term of patent protection is 20 years from the -- the date of the application. Obviously Congress thought 20 years was better than 10 and presumably that was because 20 years gives greater incentive to innovation. If somebody asked -­",
  "It's not fully sufficient to resolve all challenges to the -- the validity of an issued patent. Now Congress now has it before it legislative proposals, one of which has passed the Senate, one of which has been voted out of committee in -- in the House, and is currently pending before the court -- the full -- full House of Representatives, that would expand the availability of post, what we now call post-grant review proceedings, where for a limited window of time after a patent is issued, people who oppose the issuance of the patent can come in and object on any ground. And that wouldn't be limited to the -­ the grounds that are specified in the current re-examination proceeding. So this would -- it reflects Congress's understanding that there is a problem with patents that should not have been issued, but its desire to create additional mechanisms for the PTO to address that problem, rather than to have it be done through litigation. But that -- the point I was going to make about the 20 and the 10 years is somebody could ask, well if 20 years is better than 10, why wouldn't 30 be better than 20? And the only answer is 30 presumably would give the patentee even more -- or the potential patentee even more incentive to invent, but at a certain point Congress decides that countervailing considerations require an end. And it has essentially done something of the same thing with re-examination. It said we're not going to go so far in the direction of protecting patent holders' reliance interests as to preclude the PTO from reassessing what it's done, but that doesn't mean that reliance interests aren't important. And the third thing I would say is even when a defendant in an infringement suit comes forward with prior art that was not itself considered by the PTO, there's always the possibility that that prior art will be substantively equivalent to prior art that the PTO did consider; and so in cases like this, in form the defendant would be asking the jury to make a determination that the PTO had never made, but in substance, what the defendant would be asking the jury to do is conclude that what the PTO thought was a patentable advance really was not so.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin with the question of double penalties because I think it helps to clarify exactly what the compliance order does and does not do in terms of altering the legal regime to which the Sacketts are subject. The compliance order is intended to specify the violation that EPA believes to have occurred and the measures that EPA believes are necessary in order to achieve prospective compliance. And the statute does provide separately for penalties for violating the statute and penalties for violating the compliance order. And, as an exercise of our duty of candor to the Court, we acknowledged in our brief that the Government reads the statute to allow the legal possibility of double penalties; that is, up to 37,500 per day for violating the statute, up to 37,500 per day for violating the compliance order. I think that's really a theoretical rather than a practical - -",
  "Well, that language in the order would have been accurate even if the statute didn't authorize penalties for violating the -- the order itself. That is, even if the statute authorized penalties only for violating the Act, it would have been accurate for EPA to say we believe this is what is necessary to achieve compliance, and if you don't do it, you will potentially be subject to these civil penalties; namely, civil penalties for violating the statute. But the reason I say that it's -- the double penalties as a theoretical possible -- let me say that again. If there were no provision for penalties for violating the compliance order, only penalties for violating the statute, EPA could accurately have said we believe that the following steps are necessary in order to achieve prospective compliance with the Act, and if you don't do these things, you will be subject to the following penalties because you will then be in violation of the Act and you will be subject to the penalties - -",

I guess the other thing I would say is the possibility that penalties would be increased doesn't distinguish this scheme from the sort of regime that Justice Kennedy referred to or the sorts of regimes that we've discussed in our brief.

  "We have not adopted a policy to that effect. And I guess what I -- I do want to clarify - -",
  "I guess the two -- I don't know that we have ever asked for more than the 37,500 per day. Now, I think it is often the case what -- that what district courts will do is, within the 37,500 statutory maximum, they will say we are imposing a greater penalty for the period after the compliance order was issued because it shows greater culpability to continue with the violation after you've been warned. But that's not a feature of the compliance order that distinguishes it from all manner of other agency warnings.",
  "And, again, we don't dispute that violating the order could as a realistic matter cause the penalties to be greater within the statutory maximum. But, as I was saying, in many situations, agencies give warnings to regulated parties: If you keep doing this, you may be subject to penalties.",
  "That's correct.",
  "As a practical matter, we are not aware of any case in which the penalties imposed have been greater than the per-day statutory maximum for the violation.",
  "It -- in terms -- I think, first of all, we would say that until we floated the theoretical possibility in our opening brief, the Sacketts seemed to be entirely unaware of it.

But the main point I want to - -",

The one point before I move on that I do want to make clear is, in a wide variety of contexts, agencies will issue warnings to regulated parties that they are believed to be in violation of a statute.

  "The Act doesn't specifically -- and the Act doesn't specifically tell the person to remove it, but that's our interpretation of the statute. And it's either right or wrong. That is, if we're wrong about that, if the only days on which penalties can be assessed for violating the statute itself are days on which fill was actually discharged, then the provisions of the compliance order that directed the Sacketts to remove the fill and restore the property would be beyond the scope of a proper compliance order under 13 - -",
  "That's our view as well. I'm just saying that hasn't been definitively resolved by this Court. But the position that we've taken, again, with respect to the statute itself is that in computing the daily penalties and asking how many days of violation were there, the district court should take into account not just the days on which fill was actually deposited but the days on which fill remained in the wetlands. And Petitioners have specifically expressed agreement this morning with that view of the statute. I think the view of the Petitioners' amici is to the same effect, because in many of the amicus briefs there are calculations of the very large penalties to which people could be subject if they didn't adhere to compliance orders, and they're all premised on the idea that every day fill remains in the wetlands - -",

It would be quite common for enforcement personnel to entertain informal overtures from the regulated party or his legal representative, but I think it would be extraordinary, for instance, for a U.S. Attorney's Office to grant a formal hearing to a potential criminal defendant in order to discuss the -- in order to resolve the question criminal charges should be brought. But - -",
  "I think the -- the agency's normal practice would be to issue an administrative compliance order before initiating judicial proceedings. That is, the statute doesn't require it, but the EPA ordinarily would not commence a lawsuit without first giving the regulated party one final opportunity to come into compliance.",
  "It could use that. It would typically use that for violations that it perceived to be less serious. The statutory cap on penalties is much lower than the cap in the judicial enforcement actions. I think it would probably be the case that it would issue an administrative compliance order in those situations as well. Now, one of the things that the administrative -- the cover letter to the administrative compliance order does say is, even if you comply, you are still not immune from the possibility of enforcement proceedings with respect to past violations.

And if the Court said that there was review of the administrative compliance order based on features that were distinct to the order, namely, the fact that it is couched as an order, the fact that penalties can be imposed for violation of the order itself, an opinion along those lines wouldn't suggest that.",

  "I mean, I think you're right as a matter of typical agency practice that there would be an invitation well before the compliance order was issued to come in and give your side of the story. And you're probably right that, if we got to the point where a compliance order was issued, then the likelihood that further communications would sway the agency substantially might be reduced.",
  "So, I would think your point there - -",
  "So, yes, I would agree with that.",
  "Well, I guess the two things, one of which may be more troubling rather than less troubling, is to say that if you're troubled by this, then there are a lot of other things that might be troubling as well because it's often the case that warnings are issued to regulated parties, and it's often the case that if the regulated party continues with the conduct after receiving the warning, the penalties may be enhanced.",
  "It is not -- it is phrased as an order, but the only thing that EPA is authorized to do under section 1319(a)(3) is to order people to do what they were already legally complied -- required to do; that is, order them to comply with their legal obligations.",

And one of the reasons that we think judicial review of the administrative compliance order within this scheme would make no sense, would be out of keeping with the rest of the statutory regime, is that it wouldn't solve the problem. As the discussion in the first part of the argument made clear, Petitioners share our view that the administrative compliance order would be subject to review if it's reviewable under a deferential standard. And if the Court held that the order was not arbitrary and capricious, that still wouldn't eliminate the possibility that if we pursued an enforcement action - -",

Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The disputed question in this case concerns the meaning of the phrase \"omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein\" in 26 U.S.C. 6501(e)(1)(A). More specifically, the question is whether an omission from gross income occurs when a taxpayer overstates his basis in sold property and thereby understates the gain that results from the sale. In December 2010, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, the Treasury Department issued published regulations that interpreted section 6501(e)(1)(A) to apply in overstatement of basis cases. Those regulations reflect a reasonable interpretation of ambiguous statutory language, and they are accordingly entitled to deference under Chevron.",
  "If the Court in Colony had interpreted the statutory language to be unambiguous, or if the Court in Colony had issued an authoritative interpretation that Congress had then built upon, that would be correct. But the Court in Colony stated that the language was, in its words, \"not unambiguous.\"",
  "I think -- I don't think that the Court in Colony purported to give a definitive definition of the phrase \"omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein\" wherever it appears in the United States Code. And the Court in the first paragraph of its opinion in Colony said the sole question before us is whether the taxpayer is subject to the extended assessment period under the 19 -- under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. And as the D.C. Circuit, for instance, pointed out in Intermountain, what we are interpreting now is the 1954 code. It's true that, like the 1939 code, it includes the phrase \"omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein,\" but it also includes adjacent provisions that bear upon the meaning of that phrase. I think - -",
  "I think it's important to remember that the 1954 code was enacted in 1954, and the Colony decision came in 1958. And so, I would take your point that if Congress had enacted the same language after this Court's decision in Colony, then the adjacent statutory provisions that we're relying on would be pretty indirect means of an -- of expressing an intent to change the law. But what Congress was reacting to in 1954 was not this Court's Colony decision; it was reacting to a circuit conflict and trying to resolve that conflict.",
  "Well, let me point to the statutory provisions that I have in mind, to explain a little bit more fully why we think that the context in which the new provision or the 1954 provision appears bears on the -- the proper interpretation of the disputed phrase. It's at page 1a of the red brief, the appendix to the Respondents' brief. And the -- the general rule stated in subsection (A) is: \"If the taxpayer omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of 25 percent of the amount of gross income stated in the return,\" the assessment period is 6 years rather than 3 years. And it's important to recognize that, for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code generally, the term \"gross income\" is defined to include gains derived from dealings in property. And in that sense, it might - -",

  "As I say, I would agree that if Congress had passed this statute after the Court's decision in Colony, that this would have been a fairly oblique way to reflect an intent to change what the Court had done.

  "No, I -- I guess there are two things I'm saying. The first thing I'm saying is, in order to construe the statute, we need to not put ourselves in -- attempt to put ourselves in the minds of Congress, but at least be aware of the state of the world at the time that Congress acted. And in 1954, when Congress acted, there was the circuit split. And if Congress had wanted to endorse the Colony rule going forward and apply it to trades -- to non-trade and -business taxpayers as well as trades and businesses, the most natural thing would have been to change the word \"amount\" in the main rule to \"item,\" to make clear that the main rule would apply only when an item of gross receipts had been left off the return altogether. It also would have been natural, if Congress had wanted that rule to apply going forward, to change the term \"gross income\" in the main rule to say \"gross receipts\" because gross income - -",

  "And what - -",
  "I guess my main point is we think our reading of the text is better, and what Respondents have going for them is the argument that, whether or not this is the way you would otherwise construe the statute, once Colony has said what the statute meant, the Court is bound by it. And our point is that methodology doesn't really work with this provision, because the Court in Colony - -",

  "Let me give two -- let me - - let me give two responses to that, Justice Breyer. I think in effect what Justice Harlan did for the Court in Colony was to construe the term, the reference to an amount of gross income, as though it meant item of gross receipts.

  "Well, at the time that the 2009 regulation was promulgated first in temporary form, we had lost cases in two courts of appeals.

Phinney involved a situation in which the taxpayer accurately reported the amount of gross receipts, approximately $375,000, but misstated the nature of the receipts as proceeds of a stock sale rather than of an installment sale. And the reason that that misstatement of the nature of the receipt made a difference was that it potentially affected the taxpayer's entitlement to take a stepped-up basis. And so, the court of appeals in Phinney said that was subject to the extended assessment period, that the misstatement of the nature of the - -",
  "Well, I -- I think one reason you might think that is that if you were -- you -- the opinion was not oblivious to the fact that the 1954 code had been enacted in the meantime, and the Court went out of its way to say: We are discussing only the 1939 code, and we are not pronouncing on the meaning of the 1954 code, other than to note that our -- our conclusion in this case is consistent with the unambiguous language of new 6501(e)(1)(A).

Circuit explained in Intermountain, that is best read as a reference to subparagraph (i), which says that for a trade or business taxpayer, \"gross income\" will mean gross receipts without an offset for the cost of acquiring goods and services. So - -",
  "-- I think, as a taxpayer, you would at least be on notice that there was uncertainty as to the proper meaning of the -- the code. Judge Boudin had written for the First Circuit in a case called CC&F W. Operations in 2001 that it was at least doubtful whether the main holding of Colony carried over to the new -- the 1954 code. That was certainly dictum, but it also flagged the fact that this was a subject of uncertainty. And remember, the provision at issue here doesn't bear on the legality of the taxpayer's substantive returns. The only question is whether the IRS has 3 years or 6 years to make an extended assessment. So, as of 2003, when 3 years from the date of the return had run for these taxpayers, I think the -- what was out there gave them notice that there was at least uncertainty whether Colony applied.",

They are citing it as though it were a definitive statement of agency position as to the operation of the assessment period. It -- it was not that. It was a document issued by a single district counsel. And in a sense, the -- the reference to Colony as continuing to -- as though it continued to govern the -- the 1954 code was dictum because the district counsel, even in that document, stated that it would not be inappropriate to - -",

  "No, this is not advice to the taxpayer. That document was a memorandum from the district counsel to another IRS official. The other IRS official was seeking guidance with regard to the question of whether we needed to get within the 3-year assessment period or whether it was appropriate to rely on the 6-year assessment period. And although the district counsel cited Colony in a way that it suggested that it continued to control the operation of the 1954 code, the district counsel stated on the facts of this case it would not be inappropriate to rely on the - -",
  "That's correct, but not - - didn't come to the same conclusion as the IRS did in litigating the case in Phinney, didn't come to the same conclusion as the IRS did in - -",
  "I -- first I would say - -",
  "That notice would not say - - tell you anything relevant to the computation of the assessment period.",
  "Again, I'm not quite sure what you mean by saying: would seem to say that you could do this. I don't think that there were any affirmative IRS statements that could lead people to believe that the Son-of-BOSS mechanism was okay, but what - -",
  "No. No, it's not true that the IRS had advised people that Son-of-BOSS transactions were okay. It wasn't until 2000 that the IRS issued a specific document that said, as a matter of agency policy, they're not okay. But, again, that document was just a kind of case-specific application of the more general -- of the more general proposition that transactions lacking economic substance can be disregarded. With respect to why the overstatement of basis is treated differently from the overstated deduction, that follows inexorably from the language of the code. That is, Congress defined the conduct that would trigger the general rule as an omission from gross income, and because of the way that gross income is defined, an overstatement of basis can lead to an understatement of gain, which in turn is taken into account in computing gross income. A deduction may ultimately affect taxable income, but it doesn't affect gross income. And so, there would be no way of reading the statute to encompass that. Now, as to why Congress would have done this, I think a clue is furnished by subparagraph Roman (ii), which is at the bottom of page 1a, and it says: \"In determining the amount omitted from gross income, there shall not be taken into account any amount which is omitted from gross income stated in the return if such amount is disclosed in the return, or in a statement attached to the return, in a manner adequate to apprise the Secretary of the nature and amount of such item.\" And so, that provides a safe harbor that says even if you fall within the general rule, even if you understated your gross income by more than 25 percent, if, at some point in the return, you gave the IRS adequate information to notice that the misstatement had taken place, you will be off the hook for the 6-year assessment period. And I think that is highly relevant in responding to the policy concern that Justice Harlan identified in Colony. That is, Justice Harlan said the reason we think that Congress intended to restrict the statute to situations where an item is left off the return altogether is that those would be the most difficult for the IRS to catch; the IRS would be placed at a special disadvantage. Here in subparagraph (ii), Congress has accomplished the same intent but through a different mechanism. That is, it's made the general rule sweep more broadly but given taxpayers an out where the disclosures are adequate. If I could reserve the balance of my time.",
  "I don't think that - -",
  "I don't think he will say - - I don't want to speculate too much on what he will say, but I think his position is an overstatement of basis could never trigger the assessment period because the item of gross receipts would have been adequately disclosed.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to make three quick points. First, Mr. Garre refers to the amended heading of section -- subsection 6501(e), which now states \"Substantial omission of items,\" but I think the heading simply points up the fact that some provisions within subsection (e) refer to amounts and some to items. Subsection (e)(2), which deals with estate and gift taxes, refers to omission of items. And the legislative history makes clear that Congress chose that term precisely to make clear that the understatement -- or the overstatement or understatement of an item that was reported will not give rise to the extended period. The second thing is that, at bottom, Respondents argue that the -- that the phrase \"amount of gross income\" should be construed to mean item of gross receipts. And they don't offer any real textual argument as to why that would be a sound reading. Really, they rely exclusively on Colony. But the Court in Colony said, at the beginning of its opinion, that it was pronouncing only on the 1939 code. It said at the end of its opinion that it was not generally trying to construe the 1954 code. And it stated that the relevant -- the most relevant language was not unambiguous. And I think the recognition of ambiguity is relevant in part because it sets up our Brand X argument, but it's also relevant because saying that a particular snippet of language is ambiguous is to recognize that its meaning may vary depending on context. And the - -",
  "No. I mean, Brand X was the first case that announced the Brand X principle, and the Court has not applied it since. Justice Stevens - -",
  "That was applying it to a court of appeals decision.",
  "No. Justice Stevens wrote a separate opinion in Brand X, suggesting that it might not apply to decisions of this Court, but the Court as a whole did not pronounce on that. And then the third point I would want to make is that Mr. Garre referred to cases and one IRS General Counsel opinion that were issued during the period between 1958 and 2000 that applied Colony to the current statute, but they did so in a very specific way. That is, they relied on the aspects of Colony that talked about Congress's purpose to reserve the extended assessment period for cases in which the IRS was at a special disadvantage due to inadequate disclosure. And those cases applied that language in elucidating current subparagraph (ii), which provides a safe harbor in cases of adequate disclosure. Respondents' position goes much further, though. Respondent is attempting to rely on Colony for the proposition that even if its disclosures were inadequate, the extended period still can't be applied to it. And none of the decisions on which Respondents rely establish that proposition. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It's common ground in this case that in order to be an outside salesman, an employee must make sales. And in theory there are two different ways in which Respondent could have attempted to establish that the PSRs in this case fit that criteria.",
  "Well, the DOL regulations have since 19 -- I believe it's since 1949, have said that \"make a sale\" within the meaning of 203(k), the term \"making a sale\" within the meaning of 3(k) includes a transfer of title. And in theory, the verb \"includes\" could leave open the possibility that other things could be included as well. We've never encountered a situation in which DOL has found a sale of goods without a transfer of title. But in direct answer to your question, Justice Alito, about --",
  "It would be -- with specific respect to consignments for sale, it would have been more precise to say that there has to be a transfer of possession in contemplation of a transfer of title.",
  "DOL believes that they qualify, but not as sales of goods. And if the -- the Court could look at the appendix to the blue brief on page 4. This is the pertinent regulation that refers to making sales or obtaining orders. And it says: \"Section 541.500 requires that the employee be engaged in making sales within the meaning of section 3(k) of the Act or obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities.\" And DOL's view is that a rental agreement would be a contract for services or for the use of facilities. And the way --",
  "They have supplemented 3(k), and they did that --",
  "The -- this is discussed in the Stein Report, which was issued in 1940, and what had happened was that the question had arisen -- and the Stein report lays this out in a fair amount of detail. The question had arisen whether individuals who negotiate for contracts to buy time on the radio or sell time -- sell advertising space in newspapers or sell -- negotiate contracts for carriage of freight by rail or truck -- the question arose whether they were outside salesmen within the meaning of the statute. And the Stein Report explained that the Wage and Hour Division had taken the position that they were not because it interpreted \"sales\" -- it appears to have interpreted \"sales\" to refer only to sales of goods, and people who were engaged in those sorts of businesses were not selling goods. But the Stein Report said: However, these people are commonly regarded as salesmen; the contracts they negotiate are treated as sales.",
  "Well --",
  "The agency has taken the position that, even though it has construed 3(k) to refer only to sales of goods, that sales of services or contracts for the use of facilities can be covered. However, there's a big difference between the interaction between a detailer and a physician and the interaction between the -- the person who sells time on the radio. The person --",
  "Well, the -- the theory on which the Stein Report proceeded was that, even though sales of time on the radio were not sales of goods, they were still customarily regarded as sales, and they had the essential attributes of sales; namely, an exchange of something valuable that the seller possessed in return for consideration from the buyer. And you don't have any of that when the detailer deals with the -- with the --",
  "Well, the first thing I would say is that we wouldn't agree that this would cover detailers. That is, if the relevant sales are, as we believe, GSK's sales to -- the transfer of drugs to wholesalers and pharmacies in return for consideration, the detailers don't play an essential role in the consummation of those sales. They don't participate in those sales. It's true that their mission is to engage in activities which set in motion a chain of events that will make those sales more likely to occur, but we wouldn't regard them as --",
  "But I think much the same thing could have been said about all the promotional workers that DOL has done with -- has dealt with in the past. That is, the premise, the justification for a company to hire a promotional worker, is that the promotional activities will increase the overall sales of the company, will either directly or indirectly set in motion a chain of events that leads people to buy the product. But DOL has historically regarded those activities as distinct from selling the product.",
  "Some employees may work on commission. Some --",
  "It's -- I don't think there is necessarily a uniform rule one way or the other. The Stein Report did say in 1940 that, although it was characteristic for outside salesmen to receive commissions, that was not the test, that that was a quirk of compensation. The other thing I would say --",

The commitments or the quasi-commitments from physicians in and of themselves are of no value.",
  "Well, to the extent that there was an industry expectation that was based on anything DOL had said, it was based on, as far as we know, based on the 1945 opinion letter, which said not --",
  "Right.",
  "Again, our argument is not that they should have known from the -- about the opinion letter. Our argument is that the proper application of the promotion sales regulation to the facts of this case is pretty clear, and that if GSK's top-level management was asked to defend the use of detailers, they would say these people are important because if they persuade physicians to write more prescriptions and those are filled with GSK products, then pharmacies will reorder the drug and our wholesalers will reorder it from us.",

  "No, I'm not arguing for that rule. The --",
  "It does -- it has phased out the opinion letter program and gives other forms of administrative guidance. That is, DOL's rationale was that the opinion letter program had not been cost effective because often the bottom line -- may I -- often the bottom-line answer to the question would turn on factual nuances of a particular employer and wouldn't provide much guidance to others. And so, it's tried to provide forms of guidance that are -- speak to the industry or a class of employees as a whole.",

I think in both cases, our overriding objective was to offer a reading of section 109(a) that would not supersede, or would not effectively negate the importation prohibition in section 602(a)(1), because from the Copyright Office's perspective, we agree with Mr. Olson that the primary reason for the enactment of 602(a)(1) was to facilitate market segmentation. And the argument we made in Quality King was you can accomplish that; you can prevent section 109(a) - -",
  "I think the best thing I could point to is a report of the Registrar of Copyrights that was issued in 1965, in which the Copyright Office identified as one of the circumstances that would be covered by the importation ban, the situation in which, quote, \"the copyright owner had authorized the -- the manufacture of copies in a foreign country for distribution only in that country.\" It didn't use the phrase \"market segmentation,\" but clearly, the point was the same. You are authorizing copies to be made abroad for distribution only in that place, not for redistribution here. And so - -",
  "That's correct.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Well, we lost that case 9-0, and so I am not arguing too vociferously that the Court should change its opinion. But yes, we think that we still would adhere to our view that section 109(a) should not be read as a limitation on section 602(a)(1). If the Court had gone that path, it could read \"lawfully made under this title\" to encompass both foreign-made and domestic-made copies, without doing damage to the copyright holder's ability to segment markets. On the other hand - -",
  "Well, we're not urging the Court to take that course, but yes, that would have been one way to accomplish the same objective. And so - -",
  "I think that's correct, but I think our Bobbs-Merrill argument does provide a very principled way to stop it there without going back on what the Court said in Quality King. That is, Bobbs-Merrill was a 1908 case in which the publisher sold books to retailers on the proviso that they not be sold at retail for less than a specified amount. One of the retailers violated that resale restriction and was sued for copyright infringement. And this Court in Bobbs-Merrill said - - parsed the statutory language, which at that time gave the copyright owner the exclusive right to vend copies of the work.",
  "Maybe I can put it this way: If I buy a piratical copy of a book, one that was illegally made without the consent of the copyright owner, and all I do is read it and put it on my shelf, I can't rely on 109(a) because the copy was not lawfully made under this title. But I still couldn't be held liable for copyright infringement because there is no exclusive right to read the book or to own it. I wouldn't have been infringing any of the copyright owner's rights. And so in order to have a valid claim for copyright infringement, the copyright owner would have to show both that 109(a) was inapplicable, and that what the defendant was doing was a violation, an infringement of one of the exclusive rights. And Mr. Rosenkranz seems to postulate a situation in which a cagey manufacturer would locate its facilities overseas, make the copies there, import them into the United States, sell them in this country, subject to conditions on resale. And if the goods were resold in violation of those restrictions, the copyright owner would sue for infringement. And I think the first argument the defendant would make is that is exactly the conduct that the Court in Bobbs-Merrill said did not infringe the exclusive right to vend. Now -- namely the resale in violation of restrictions on resale. How can you now say it's now an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute? And it would be a particularly difficult argument for the copyright owner to make because what the House Report said in 1909, it didn't say exactly that it was codifying the holding of Bobbs-Merrill; it said that it was amending the statute in other respects, and it wanted to make clear that there was no intent to enlarge the exclusive right to vend. And so the Plaintiff, in Mr. Rosenkranz's hypothetical, would in effect be arguing that by codifying section 109(a), Congress had implicitly expanded the scope of the implicit -- of the exclusive right to vend or distribute, even though it said it was doing the various opposite.",
  "But I think that would be true under anybody's reading. That is, once a court in a case determined for whatever reason that section 109(a) was inapplicable, it didn't provide a safe harbor, the next step could never be simply to proceed to judgment and say that there was infringement. The next step would always have to be to look at what the defendant had done - -",
  "The other point I would make about the Petitioner's approach is that it -- it really has no grounding in the statutory text. That is, the Petitioner is arguing that if the publisher in Thailand, if the manufacturer of the books had shipped them directly into this country, that person could have been sued for infringement for the importation and - -",
  "I -- I give two answers for that. And the first is that Coke was saying that, in most circumstances at least, a sale is sufficient in order to divest the owner of his prior right to control distribution, but it doesn't say that a sale is necessary. And my point is that when Mr. Rosenkranz says the hypothetical foreign publisher who makes copies with authorization but ships it into the -- them into the United States without could be held liable for infringement, there is nothing in section 109(a) that would allow a court to draw that distinction; that is, although 109(a) is sometimes referred to as a codification of the First Sale Doctrine, it doesn't require an antecedent first sale. So as long as the foreign publisher was the owner of the books at the type -- time they were manufactured, if those books were lawfully made under this title, under Petitioner's reading they could be imported and distributed. We know also that this was not an oversight, that Congress didn't intend the provision to be subject to a sort of implicit first authorized sale requirement, because the language was intended to cover copies that were made pursuant to a compulsory license.",
  "Well, if they actually happened, then I think the -- the horribles would be worse. But, as I say, we -- we feel that we have offered a reading of all the statutory provisions together that would avoid both. The other couple of things I would say as to why a first sale by itself - -",
  "I would say that the consequence that all foreign-made goods, even if imported into the United States with the authorization of the U.S. copyright owner, are subject to continuing licensing requirements, etc., I would say that would be worse than the frustration of market segmentation that would occur under Petitioner's view.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: On Friday, the EPA administrator signed a new rule that amends EPA's existing regulatory definition of the term \"stormwater discharge associated with industrial activity.\" The new rulemaking specifically disapproves the Ninth Circuit's decision in this case and states explicitly that the only facilities under SIC Code 2411 that are industrial are rock crushing, gravel washing, log sorting, and log storing.",

  "Well, I think the question of attorneys' fees, if the Ninth Circuit's decision was vacated on the ground that the case would become moot, attorneys' fee are available under the Clean Water Act and citizen suits only to prevailing or substantially prevailing parties. And I don't see any way that Respondent could make a claim to be a prevailing or substantially prevailing party when, at the end of the day, it got no relief. Now, with respect to questions of remediation and, particularly, of civil penalties, the Court, in Steel Company and Laidlaw, addressed the circumstances under which civil penalties would -- could and could not be awarded in citizen suits. And the Court in Steel Company said that, in citizen suits, a citizen plaintiff lacks standing to seek civil penalties as a remedy for past violations because the citizen derives no benefit from payment of the penalties into the treasury. In Laidlaw, the Court held that, where there is a prospect of recurring violations or ongoing violations, the citizen plaintiff does have standing to seek civil penalties as a deterrent to future illegality.",
  "That's correct. That even if -- if, by the time the -- the suit was wound up, there was no prospect of an ongoing or future violation because EPA had amended the rule to make clear that the conduct was lawful, there would be no future illegally to deter. And then there -­",
  "That's correct. And if we actually had a civil penalty award issued by the district court in the first instance, it might be a more complicated question whether that award should be vacated. But the district court ruled in the petitioner's favor. There was never any civil penalty award. And so if -- if the question is can the district court, at some future stage of this case, enter a civil penalty award, under Laidlaw, the only justification for that in a citizen suit would be to deter illegal conduct that might be thought to be possible after the civil penalty award was issued and -­",
  "It would not have to be based on the assumption that the Ninth Circuit decision was wrong at the time that it was entered; that is, even if EPA had done something that was explicitly characterized as a change in the law, if EPA had issued a rule-making that said, what Petitioners had been doing was unlawful up to this point, but we've decided that it shouldn't be unlawful, and, therefore, we're amending the rule to make it legal, if EPA had done that, there would still be no prospect of future illegality, assuming that the rule is taken to be valid. And, therefore, although in an EPA enforcement action, there might be a possibility of getting monetary awards for past misconduct because that's something the government can do, the citizen's only stake in the matter would be to deter future illegalities.",
  "It certainly is possible that the rule will be challenged, but, as -- as Petitioners have emphasized in their brief, and we agree, the proper forum for adjudicating challenges to the validity of an EPA regulation is through a suit brought against EPA based on the administrative record; that is, a citizen suit against the petitioners -­",
  "You don't know.

But with respect to the other two elements of relief, I think those can be easily dealt with as a matter of law; that is, to the extent that they are seeking an injunction ordering that no further discharges occur without a permit, then clearly, the propriety of that sort of injunction would be determined under the new rule, and it wouldn't be available. And I think Laidlaw is clear that the only basis that a citizen has for seeking civil penalties is to deter future violations, not to punish prior violations.",

  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At the beginning of the argument, Justice Kagan asked whether a pure exculpatory clause, a provision in a contract that simply said, we promise not to seek relief under the arbitration -- under the antitrust clause period would be enforceable, and Mr. Kellogg replied that it would not. And I think the unenforceability of such a provision would not depend on any analysis of what was likely to happen if the suit was brought in court; that is, a pure exculpatory clause could be set aside and the plaintiff could still lose for any number of reasons. The plaintiff could be denied class certification and decide it's uneconomical to proceed with an individual suit. He could lose on a threshold ground like the statute of limitations or he could lose on the merits. But the unenforceability of the pure exculpatory clause wouldn't require the Court to make a comparison between being kicked out of court on that basis and what would likely happen if the suit were able to be brought. And we would submit that the same mode of analysis applies when the arbitration agreement can be shown to have the same practical effect as an exculpatory clause; that is, if it is the case that given the amount of money at stake, the arbitration procedure specified in the contract and the modes of proof that would be necessary in arbitration, if it can be shown persuasively by the plaintiff who bears the burden that no reasonable plaintiff would find it economically feasible to proceed, then the arbitration agreement can't be enforced --",
  "Yes. And it would be --",
  "The question would be whether the arbitration agreement could be enforced. And before Rule 23 was adopted, if there had been a pure exculpatory clause, it would have been unenforceable and --",
  "In the same way that we would say a pure exculpatory clause would be invalid and unenforceable, even if it were clear from the plaintiff's complaint that he was not entitled to relief on the merits.",
  "That's correct. And I would make two real world --",
  "No, the attorneys' fees would be recoupable under the substantive law.",
  "We are not really --",
  "No, I think we are not comparing it to anything. That is, our -- our position is in determining whether the arbitration agreement has the same practical effect as an exculpatory clause, we asked could any reasonable plaintiff proceed under the terms and conditions that are set up? And if the answer to that is no, then the arbitration agreement is unenforceable. Now, I would make two real-world points, one of which Mr. Clement has already alluded to. The first is the only cases that are going to wind up in court are those in which the plaintiff at least believes that it would be feasible to vindicate the claim in court, and so they are likely to be those in which there is at least a potential difference between the outcome in court and the outcome in arbitration. The other is, even if a plaintiff believes wrongly that he can proceed in court through a class action mechanism and class action -- class certification is denied under Rule 23, presumably at that point the plaintiff is going to give up and the outcome at the end of the day is going to be the same as if the arbitration agreement had been enforced.",
  "Well, let me start --",
  "Let me start with your last question and work backwards. It is possible and it sometimes has happened in the lower court cases that a plaintiff will come into court and say, I can't proceed through arbitration because the arbitral fees are too high in relation to my likely recovery. And the defendant at that point will say, we offer to waive the fees or we offer to pay your share of the arbitral fees, and a court will be persuaded that, given that consensual modification of the contract, it is feasible for the claims to be brought in arbitration and the plaintiff is kicked out of court. Now, this is consensual. This is something that the court has -- that the court has done at the company's behest, and it would be different question of whether the court could do that over the company's objection. But another thing that the company could do is put in a severability clause in the contract that would specify what results should obtain if one provision of the contract were held to be invalid. I guess another thing I would say in response to your question is we do have one data point, the First Circuit's decision in Kristian, which I believe Mr. Clement referred to, in 2006, which essentially held on facts similar to these that the arbitration clause as written was not enforceable because the cost of the expert fees in an antitrust case would dwarf any potential recovery, and we haven't seen the floodgates opened. The last thing I would say is if this is the concern, Petitioner's proposed rule really doesn't match the argument in its favor. That is, Petitioner is not just arguing for a rule that would cover cases in which the relevant costs are those of experts or similar authorities. Petitioner's rule would say even if the contract provides for a non-recoupable $500 filing fee and the amount of the claim at stake is $200, so it's absolutely apparent on the face of the contract that the claim can't be brought, the agreement is still enforceable and the plaintiff is deprived of his day in court. The other thing I would say about Petitioner's argument is the challenge to the Second Circuit's decision has really changed drastically since the cert petition was filed; that is, the Second Circuit took it as essentially undisputed that the costs of the expert report would render it economically infeasible to proceed in arbitration, and it took the further step of saying, therefore the arbitration agreement is unenforceable. Now, the cert petition challenged only the \"therefore\" part of the Second Circuit's analysis. There wasn't a suggestion that the Petitioner intended to challenge the antecedent determination that these claims couldn't feasibly have been brought in individualized proceedings. And I think as Paul -- Mr. Clement said, the likely reason is that wouldn't look like a cert-worthy issue. That sort of fact-specific inquiry wouldn't seem like a wise use of this Court's resources. So having gotten cert granted on the important legal question whether the inefficacy of arbitration procedures is a basis for invalidating the agreement, Petitioners are now spending a great deal of time arguing that it would in fact have been feasible to pursue these claims through individualized arbitration. And one thing we would say in response, as Mr. Clement said --",
  "But they did get cert --",
  "They got cert granted on that question, but neither the question as so framed or the body of the cert petition suggests any challenge to the Second Circuit's factual determination that these claims could not feasibly have been brought in individualized arbitration.",
  "That's correct.",
  "It is correct that it has to be one on one, that the agreement requires only --",
  "That's correct. The agreement prohibits even the types of joinder mechanisms that might have been available when the Sherman Act was passed.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As a general matter, a payment from one business to another in exchange for the recipient's agreement not to compete is an paradigmatic antitrust trust violation. The question presented here is whether such a payment should be treated as lawful when it is encompassed within the settlement of a patent infringement suit. The answer to that question is no. Reverse payments to settle Hatch-Waxman suits are objectionable for the same reasons that payments not to compete are generally objectionable. They subvert the competitive process by giving generic manufacturers an incentive to accept a share of their rival's monopoly profits as a substitute for actual competition in the --",
  "I mean, there are really two differences between that -- that scenario and the one presented here. The first is that an exclusive license is expressly authorized by the Patent Act, in Section 261 of Title 35, but -- but the second thing is --",
  "The second thing is that an exclusive license doesn't give the -- the infringement defendant anything that it couldn't hope to achieve by prevailing in the lawsuit. That is, if the -- at least any right to compete that it wouldn't get by prevailing in the lawsuit. If the infringement defendant won, it would be able to sell wherever it wanted to. Now, there may be some --",
  "But the point of --",
  "But the point here is that the money is being given as a substitute for earning profits in a competitive marketplace. That is, in -- in the Hatch-Waxman settlement context, by definition, we have a disagreement by parties as to the relative merits of the infringement and -- and/or validity questions as to the patent infringement suit. The brand name is saying its patent is valid and infringed. The generic is saying either that the patent is invalid or that its own conduct won't be infringing or both. And if the generic wins, it will be able to enter the market immediately. If the brand name wins, it will be able to keep the generic off until the patent expires. And so in that circumstance, a logical subject of compromise would be to agree upon an entry date in between those two end points, just as the parties to a damages action would be expected to settle the case by the defendant agreeing to pay a portion of the money it would have to pay if it lost. That's an actual subject of compromise and we don't have a problem with that.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, if you adopt Respondent's conception of what it means to act within the scope of the patent. And let me explain. When Respondents say that the restrictions at issue here are within the scope of the patent, what they mean is that the goods that are being restricted are arguably encompassed by the patent and the restriction doesn't extend past the date when the patent expires. That's all they mean. And if that were the exclusive test, the defendants in Masonite, in New Wrinkle, in Line Material, they would all have been off the hook because all of those cases involved restrictions on trade in patented goods during the period that the patent was in effect, and yet, the Court found antitrust liability in each of these. Now, the way that Respondent tries to explain Masonite, for example, Masonite involved a resale price maintenance agreement in which the patentholder sold goods and then attempted to control the price at which they would be resold, and the Court said that under the rule of patent exhaustion, the patentholder didn't have the right to do that and therefore the patent laws provided no shield and the agreement was held to be a violation of the antitrust laws. Now, Respondents say, well, that's consistent with their theory because the restriction imposed went beyond the scope of the patent because the right to control resale is not one of the rights that the Patent Act confers. But if that's the test for whether a restriction is within the scope of the patent, then we would say that it's not met here because there's nothing in the Patent Act that says you can pay your competitor not to engage in conduct that you believe to be infringing. And really that's the thrust of their position, that if you have -- if a patentholder has a non-sham allegation that a particular mode of competition would be an infringement of its patent, the patentholder can pay the competitor not to engage in that competition. Again, we are not talking about conduct in which there has been any judicial determination that infringement has occurred. We are just talking about cases in which the patent holder has a non-sham allegation that infringement would occur.",
  "Well, the FTC has consistently taken this position. The Department of Justice, up until 2009, we didn't endorse the scope of the patent test. Indeed, in our invitation brief in Joblove we specifically said that the scope-of-the-patent test was -- didn't provide for enough scrutiny of these settlements. But what we advocated -- what the Department of Justice advocated, instead was a test that would focus on the strength and scope of the patent. That is, the likelihood that the brand name would off -- ultimately have prevailed if the suit had been litigated to judgment. And in 2009, for the first time in an amicus brief filed in the Second Circuit, we took essentially the position that we're taking here, that is that agreements of this sort should be treated as presumptively unlawful with the presumption able to be rebutted in various ways.",
  "We would say that that's not a way, that --",
  "Well, the test is whether there has been a payment that would tend to skew the parties' choice of an entry date, that would tend to provide an incentive for the parties to -- for the generic to agree to an entry date later than the one that it would otherwise insist on. Now, it probably is the case that our test would have greater practical import in cases where the parties perceive the patent to be --",
  "Well, I think in the kind of settlement that we would regard as legitimate, where the parties simply agree to a compromise date of generic entry, then the parties would certainly take into account their own assessment of what would likely happen at the end of the suit. And so if the parties believe that the brand name was likely to prevail, then if the brand name agreed to early generic entry at all, it would presumably be for a fairly small amount of time. Conversely, if the parties collectively believe that the generic -- that the brand name had a weak case and the generic was likely to prevail, then they would negotiate for an earlier date. And the problem with the reverse payment is that it gives the generic an incentive to accept something other than competition as a means of earning money. I mean, to take another --",
  "These suits -- these types of payments appear to be essentially unknown in other lawsuits and in other patent infringement cases.",
  "Congress has tried to reduce the incentives for these payments to be made. I mean --",
  "Well, a couple things I would say. First, I don't think we're -- we're not asking you to overturn established antitrust laws. To take another analogy, for example, if Watson instead of developing a generic equivalent to AndroGel, had developed an entirely new drug that it believed would be better than AndroGel for the same conditions and if Solvay had paid Watson not to seek FDA approval and not to seek -- to market the drug, I think everyone would agree that that was a per se antitrust violation, even though Watson's ultimate ability to market the new drug would depend on FDA approval that might or might not be granted. And so when we say it's unlawful to buy off uncertain competition, it's unlawful to buy off competition, even when the competition might have been prevented by other means, we are just enforcing standard antitrust principles. To focus on the distinction between Hatch-Waxman and other patent litigation, Professor Hovenkamp's conclusion is that the reason that you don't see payments like this in the normal patent infringement suit is that in the typical market if a patent holder were known to have paid a large sum of money to a competitor who had been making a challenge to the patent, if other competitors knew that that had happened, then they would perceive that to be a sign that the patent was weak and that they would leap in. But he says Hatch-Waxman makes it more difficult for that to be done because Hatch-Waxman gives unique incentives to the first paragraph 4 filer.",
  "It's a 180-day period of exclusivity.",
  "Yes, and the way it works is that the exclusivity period is not good in and of itself for consumers. That is, during the period when one generic is on the market and the others are not yet allowed to compete, you have essentially duopoly conditions, the price of the -- the drug drops but only by a little bit. Congress granted the 180-day exclusivity period because it wanted generics to have ample incentives to challenge patents that were perceived to be weak. And if the first filer is able to essentially to be bought off, is able to set settle for something other than early entry into the marketplace, then other potential competitors face barriers to entry that they -- similarly situated competitors wouldn't face in other industries.",
  "Well, the -- the Court has recognized such a thing as the quick look approach, but I think even though the case didn't use the term \"quick look,\" I don't believe it did, NCAA v. Regents of University of Oklahoma is probably the best example, where the --",
  "Well, that's the -- that's the one I'm most familiar with.",
  "I'll need to look back and see what --",
  "I think that would leave courts without guidance as to --",
  "-- without guidance as to what factors would be appropriate --",
  "Well, certainly our proposed approach accounts for that. It provides -- it provides really two different forms of rebuttal. First our approach says, this is on its face an agreement not to compete, the generic has agreed to stay out of the market for a defined period of time, and the payment gives rise to an inference that the agree -- that the delay that the generic has agreed to is longer than the period that would otherwise reflect its best assessment of its likelihood of -- of success in the lawsuit. But then we say, there are basically two different types of ways in which the presumption could be rebutted. First, the parties can show that the payment was not in consideration for delay, that there was some other commensurate value transferred, and the payment -- and that arrangement would have been entered into even without the larger settlement. And then second, we're at least accepting the possibility that brand names and generics could come in and say, even though our payment was for delay, even though we can't identify anything else that the payment could have been consideration for, it's still, quote, \"competitive\" under --",
  "Let me say a couple of things about the administrative nightmare. The first is that to the extent that these inquiries are difficult, they're difficult only by -- because the brand names and the generics have made them difficult by tacking on additional transactions to their settlement proposal. And to take an analogy, there are government ethics rules that say that -- what are called prohibited sources. Basically, people who have business before the department can't give me gifts as a government employee. Now, obviously, it would be absurd to have a rule that said a prohibited source couldn't give me a Rolex watch, but could sell me a Rolex watch for a dollar. And so the ethics rules treat as a gift an exchange for value in which fair market value is not paid. And everybody understands that once you go down that route, occasionally, you will have hard cases in which people could legitimately agree, was this a legitimate arm's length exchange or was it a concealed gift? But the prospect of those difficult cases doesn't mean that we get rid of a gift ban altogether. And certainly, Federal employees couldn't bring the -- the ethics office to its knees by engaging in such a proliferation of these side deals that the ethics office decided it's not worth it. The second thing is that Respondent's approach would apply even when there are no hard questions. Respondents would say that even if the agreement provides for delayed generic entry until the date the patent expires, and even if the only other term of the agreement is the brand name pays the generic a lot of money, that that would be a legitimate agreement because the restriction would apply to arguably patented drugs and it wouldn't extend beyond the date of patent expiration. I guess the -- the other thing I would say about the way in which these payments can facilitate settlement really shows their anticompetitive potential. That is, suppose that the parties were negotiating for a compromise date of entry, but they couldn't agree. The -- the brand name said beginning of 2017 is the earliest we'll let you in and the generic said beginning of 2015 is the latest date that we would accept. Now, the Respondents use the term \"bridge the gap,\" but there's obviously no way that a payment from the brand name to the generic could enable the parties to agree on an entry date between 2015 and 2017. The brand name is never going to say, well, I would insist on holding out until 2017, but if I'm going to pay you a whole lot of money, then I'll let you in earlier and accept a -- a diminution of your profits. The brand name is going to say, if I pay you money, I'm going to insist on deferring entry even later than the 2017 date that would otherwise be my preferred compromise. So the natural effect of these payments is not to facilitate a -- a bridging the gap in the sense of a picking of a point between the dates that the parties would otherwise insist on. It is going -- it is very likely to cause the parties to agree to an entry date that's even later than the one the brand name would otherwise find acceptable.",
  "Not -- not price fixing, but it's -- it's an agreement not to compete. That is, the parties are not agreeing as to the prices they will charge. The generic is agreeing to stay off the market first. But that would be treated as per se --",
  "Now, if you wanted to tweak the theory in that way and to say that in cases where there is not just a payment and an agreement on the date of market entry, but there is additional consideration exchanged beside, if you wanted to say that the Plaintiff would bear the burden of showing that this was not a fair exchange for value. That -- that's not something we would agree with, but that would be a fairly minor tweak to our theory.",
  "The rule -- I mean, it's bad for reasons both of administrability and it's bad conceptually. The reason it's bad for reasons of administrability is that -- at least I take what you are proposing to be that the antitrust court would consider all the factors that might bear on the assessment of the agreement, that those would include presumably the strength of the patent claim, the subjective --",
  "It's not atypical -- I mean -- and the Court did this in NCAA, for example, where it said that the agreement it was looking at, which dealt with the allegation of -- of -- allocation of rights to televised football games was essentially a limitation on output, and the Court said those are presumptively unlawful. Long experience in the market has shown that they are suspect. The Court didn't say there was long experience in the market for television rights to football. It just said output limitations have been established as disfavored. Nevertheless, because competitive sports by nature require a degree of cooperation between the people who compete against each other -- to establish the rules of the game and so forth -- we will look to see whether the parties have identified -- whether the defendants have identified anything about their specific industry that would justify our decision not to apply the usual presumption, and it concluded that there was nothing there. And we're really asking the Court to take the same approach here. We're saying payments not to compete are generally disfavored. The parties can -- when you have a Hatch-Waxman settlement, in which money is passing from the brand name to the generic, it's an unusual settlement to begin with because there's no way that the suit could have culminated in the generic receiving a money judgment. And therefore, we'll -- we'll look upon this with suspicion, but we'll give the parties adequate opportunities to -- to rebut. If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you. Mr. Weinberger argued that in order to determine whether a settlement of this sort has anticompetitive effects, we would have to know how the lawsuit would have turned out, but it's perhaps the most fundamental principle of antitrust law that particular conduct can be legal or illegal, depending on the deliberative process that led up to it. And to put that in concrete terms, if a business charges a particular price for a particular product because it's made the assessment that this will maximize profits in a competitive environment, that decision is almost immune from antitrust scrutiny. But if the business charges the same price for the same product in the same market because it's agreed with its competitor that it will charge that price, that's a per se antitrust violation. So it's not at all anomalous to say that this type of agreement can be deemed anticompetitive, even though the same result, namely, exclusion of the generic from the market might have been able to be obtained by other means. The second thing is, Mr. Weinberger said there are instances in which second and successive filers will attempt to challenge the brand name even after the first filer has been bought off. I think we -- we disagree that it's as easy as he would say it is, but we'll concede it happens occasionally. But the fact that particular anticompetitive conduct doesn't always work doesn't make it lawful. It could often happen that two firms were thinking about entering into a price-fixing agreement, for instance, but thought to themselves, if we do that, there's a third competitor in the market who will be able to undersell us, and this would make our agreement unprofitable. And it might happen sometimes that two firms try to proceed with a price-fixing conspiracy, but they're thwarted because of the unexpected competition from a third firm.",
  "I mean, first, there certainly is no evidence suggesting that it has happened often, although there is evidence that it has happened. But if the brand name perceived on a systemic basis that the likely result of paying off one competitor was that another competitor would step in and couldn't be bought off would litigate the suit to judgment, there would be no incentive to make the reverse payment in the first place. That is, in making the reverse payment, what the -- the brand name is attempting to purchase is protection from the possibility that it will have its patent invalidated, and it will suffer a large competitive advantage. If a brand name thinks in a particular instance there is somebody else who's going to expose it to -- me to that risk, the -- the payment wouldn't be expected to be made. So at least --",
  "I think for the reasons that -- that your question suggested, that there is the 180-day exclusivity period and leaving aside the cases in which that is waived, subsequent manufacturers would realize not only that they wouldn't get that period of heightened profits themselves, but they would have to wait in line for others, and they might focus their attention on other patents that were perceived to be weak as to which they could hope to -- to get the 180-day exclusivity contract.",
  "I know it is the great majority, I don't have a percentage figure. And the reason, as I indicated earlier, was that during the 180-day exclusivity period, you have only two competitors. Basically, a biopoly arrangement. And my understanding is that the generics would usually charge around 80 to 85 percent of the brand name's price during that period. And after there is full competition, the price would drop to a fraction of that. The next thing I would say is that our system encourages settlement, but not to the nth degree. And so for instance, if you had two -- two firms fighting over a million dollars and each firm decided internally, 600,000 is the least I will accept. If they stuck to their guns, the case couldn't be settled. Now, if the public could be made to kick in an additional 200,000, then each of the firms could get its 600,000 and walk away content. But we don't pursue the policy in favor of settlement to that degree. But that's essentially what's happening here. The -- the way these payments facilitate settlement is by inducing the generics to agree to a later entry date by increasing the total pool of profits that are available to the two firms combined and thereby maximizing the likelihood that each firm will find its own share of the profit satisfactory. And the last thing I would say is I think everyone who comes to this issue recognized that there is a conundrum. Our natural instinct is to compare the settlement to the expected outcome of litigation. But everyone also recognizes that it just isn't feasible to try the patent suit. And, therefore, our approach focuses on whether the competitive process has been preserved.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The merits question in this case is whether the substantial valuation misstatement penalty applies when a taxpayer overstates his basis in property in connection with the transaction that is later determined to be a sham. The threshold jurisdictional question is whether the court, in this TEFRA partnership level proceeding, has authority to decide that merits issue. I'd like to begin with the jurisdictional question. And before I focus the Court's attention on the text, I'd like to make two quick preliminary observations about jurisdiction. The first is that the question we say is appropriate for resolution in partnership level proceedings is not whether any individual partner will actually be made to pay the penalty. There's no question in this case that the determination whether the penalty will actually be imposed on individual partners and, if so, in what amount is properly reserved for partner level proceedings. The question is simply whether the Court, in the partnership level proceeding, can make the threshold determination whether the sort of error that the IRS identifies on the partnership return can trigger a penalty down the road if the individual partner prepares his or her return in a manner consistent with the partnership return.",
  "There are two separate questions here. The first is what can be determined at the partnership level? And once the partnership level proceedings are complete, there are subsidiary partner level proceedings. And some partner level proceedings require a deficiency notice, some partner level proceedings do not. Now, it is part of our position that, once the applicability of the penalty has been determined at the partnership level, the penalty can then be imposed on individual partners in partner level proceedings without a deficiency notice. It can still be challenged through a refund proceeding, but because ­­ there's never the imposition of additional tax or penalties on the partnership itself.",
  "Let me explain, as best I can, the sequence of events that we think would unfold if this Court affirmed our view of the ­­ both held that the courts below had jurisdiction and agreed with our view of the way the penalty is supposed to operate. If the Court agreed with the position that we take in Part 2 of our merits brief, namely, that a deduction that is claimed in connection with a transaction that is later determined to be a sham can trigger ­­ if they agree ­­ if you agree with us on that legal issue, then the IRS would examine the returns of the individual partners, and it would verify that they did, in fact, claim deductions in connection with this transaction because they would have this Court's agreement with the proposition that that's the sort of thing that can trigger the penalty. They would then determine what the amount of the overpayment ­­ of the underpayment was, and they would, presumably, assess a 40 percent penalty on that. There would be a subsidiary question because the FPAA, the Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment, said individual transactions, the purchases and sales of the options and the currency and the stock, they would be treated as though they had been engaged in ­­ by the individual partners. And so at the partner level, there might be further determinations about what ­­ what a relatively small amount of tax the individual partners would ­­ would owe on that. And then if a partner ­­ if a penalty were assessed on the partner, the partner would have to pay the penalty before challenging it in through a refund action. But ­­ but we might want to ask on what ground could the partner want to challenge the penalty at that point. The partner couldn't at that stage want to make the argument that's being made in this Court, namely, that this is just not the sort of situation to which the substantial valuation misstatement penalty applies because that issue would have already been resolved against the partner in this proceeding by hypothesis, if the Court agrees with us on the merits. And so the partner would have had an opportunity to get that threshold legal issue resolved without prepaying the penalty first. Now, if an individual partner wanted to raise the good faith reasonable cause defects that's provided in 26 USC 6664(c), the partner would have to pay the penalty first before seeking a refund. But that's pretty clearly consistent with Congress's intent because Congress specified in TEFRA itself that, after the court in the partnership level proceeding has determined the applicability of the penalty, the partner can still, through refund proceedings, contend that the penalty was erroneously imposed. And that language tells us two things. It tells us, first, that Congress didn't see any necessary unfairness in requiring a partner to pay the penalty first before raising certain sorts of challenges. And it also indicates that, by applicability, Congress must have meant something different from will the penalty ultimately be imposed because, if the partnership level determination that the penalty was applicable meant that all the requirements for imposition were satisfied, there'd be no room for the partner to argue down the road that the penalty was erroneously assessed after all. So ­­",
  "When we say that the applicability of the penalty should be determined in the partnership level proceeding, all we mean is that the court in the partnership level proceeding should resolve the legal issue that is addressed in Part 2 of the respective briefs for the Petitioner and the Respondent; that is, the court should determine is the substantial valuation misstatement penalty the sort of penalty that can apply to a basis overstatement that is produced through a sham transaction. We wouldn't ask the court in the partnership level proceeding to go beyond that legal determination and to ask whether individual partners had actually underpaid their tax or whether they had actually misstated basis. It's always theoretically possible in a case like this that the partnership could be determined ­­ that the partner could participate in sham transactions. But by the time it was ­­ he had to file his own return, he could get cold feet or he could get legal advice that indicated this just isn't going to work, and so it's possible that the partner could prepare his return in a way that was lawful. And the IRS, after the partnership level proceedings were complete, would have to look at the partner return in order to see what that had ­­ what had happened. I think the main practical ­­ I'm sorry.",
  "Yes, absolutely.",
  "Absolutely. And I think that's the main practical difference between the way the system would operate under our view of TEFRA and the way it would operate under Respondent's view. That is, under ­­",
  "Exactly. Under Respondent's view, the IRS was not required to say anything at all in the FPAA about the potential imposition of basis overstatement penalties down the road. If the FPAA adjustments ­­ the shamming determination had been upheld at the partnership level, under Respondent's view, the IRS could then assess penalties against individual partners. And if the individual partners raised an objection, the same arguments that are raised in Part 2 of the Respondent's merits briefs, that would have to be litigated potentially by different judges in different partnership ­­ in different partner level proceedings with potentially inconsistent outcomes.",
  "I think that's a fair way to put it. And another way we would put it is any question that will necessarily have the same answer for all partners should presumptively be resolved at the partnership level. That is, the legal issue that's briefed in Part 2 of the parties' respective merits briefs, we may be right, Respondent may be right, but the answer is going to be the same for all partners. Either this is the sort of basis overstatement that can trigger the penalty or it isn't. The second practical difference that I wanted to ­­ to allude to, at least briefly, between our position and the Respondent's is that 6226(f) is the provision that deals with the Court's jurisdiction in a partnership level proceeding. 6221 is the provision that tells the IRS what it's supposed to do at the partnership level, and it also tells the IRS determine the applicability of any penalty that's related to an adjustment to a partnership item. Now ­­ now, one advantage of requiring the IRS to make at least this sort of threshold determination of penalties at the outset is that, if the IRS makes an adjustment to a partnership item, and the IRS believes that it is the sort of adjustment that down the road could trigger the imposition of penalties, that's the sort of thing an individual partner would want to know in deciding whether to challenge the adjustment.",
  "I don't see ­­",
  "I don't see how. I'm not sure exactly what argument you're referring to. But there are ­­ I mean, there are provisions that deal with the way the limitations periods runs, depending on when the partnership return is filed and when the partner returns are filed, but I don't see how that would happen. We ­­ we would still be subject in assessing penalties against any individual partners to whatever limitations period the code provides and either we would or would not have obtained a legal ruling on ­­ on the legal issue whether the penalties are ­­ are the sort that could follow from this partnership item adjustment, but I don't think it would have implications for the statute of limitations.",
  "Yes, Justice Ginsburg. This is on Page 6­A of the appendix to the government’s brief, and the adjustment to the partnership item is the shamming determination. The determination that the partnerships were not engaged in for business purposes, that they were engaged in purely as tax avoidance measures. And Respondent concedes that this is a partnership item because Respondent concedes that the district court had authority to review the shamming determination, decide whether that determination was appropriate. And that concession necessarily depends upon the proposition that the determination that the partnerships are shams was an adjustment to a partnership item. And it makes sense for two reasons. First, because the determination whether these are valid partnerships necessarily underlies any other determination that the IRS would make about the proper tax treatment of items reported on the partnership return. And second, it is the sort of determination that is going to have one answer for every partner, either the partnership is a sham or it's not. But it can't be the case that a particular partnership is a sham with respect to some partners and not others.",
  "Now, we would agree with Judge Sentelle that outside basis, in and of itself, is not a partnership item. An outside basis, in and of itself, is not designated as one of the things that the court in a partnership level proceeding can determine. But there ­­ and usually, it would be inappropriate to determine outside basis at that stage because, typically, outside basis will vary from partner to partner. But there are some instances in which a court needs to determine outside basis ­­",
  "I mean, in the ­­ in the more typical case, the outside basis would depend upon the amount that a particular partner had paid for his own partnership interest. And so, in that situation, not every partner would necessarily have ­­ have paid the same thing. But there are fairly rare situations in which ­­ in order to make some determination that is specified in 6226(f), the court and the IRS along the way have to determine outside basis. And one example we gave on page 32 of our brief, we have a footnote that says, it's not implicated here, but outside basis is sometimes a component of a partnership item, such as inside basis. And we cite a case that was ultimately decided by this Court, but it's a case in which a partnership took advantage of code proceedings that said you can step up your inside basis to max the outside basis of your partner ­­ partners.",
  "I think ­­ I think ­­",
  "I think what we are saying is, in order to determine whether the substantial valuation misstatement penalty would be triggered down the road, the IRS and the Court would have to make certain ­­ would have to decide what is the proper outside basis in a sham partnership. If a lawyer were asked for ­­ if a lawyer saw an adjustment that said we regard these partnerships as shams, and the lawyer were asked, does that mean that I could be subject to the substantial valuation misstatement penalty if I reported deductions on purported losses from that partnership, the only way the lawyer would answer that question is to ask, well, what's true basis in a sham partnership?",
  "I wouldn't ­­ I wouldn't put it that way. I mean, I think in this ­­",
  "Because I think that's not really the reason we're saying the Court needs to ­­ I pointed the Court to a different case in which outside basis had to be determined at the partnership level for a different reason; namely, because it was a ­­ in that case, it was a component of inside basis. And since inside basis is a partnership item, you can only determine that partnership item by reference to outside basis. Here, we have a somewhat different argument. We're saying the thing that had to be determined at the partnership level was the applicability of the penalties. And the only way you can decide whether the substantial valuation misstatement penalty is applicable is to determine what would be true basis in a sham partnership.",
  "I think it's the government's option. And if you ­­ it may be helpful to look at page 18a of the appendix to ­­ to the Respondent's brief because that actually reproduces the current version of the code that contains the 2010 penalty that ­­ that you're referring to.",
  "I mean, in some instances, the government will ­­ the government will pick the one that it thinks is easiest to prove. Some of the penalties are limited to 20 percent, whereas some can be bumped up to 40 percent, and we would look for the 40 percent penalty. But if I could, on page 18a, we're talking about Section 6662(b), and it says, \"Portion of underpayment to which section applies.\" And then it says, \"This section shall apply to the portion of any underpayment which is attributable to one or more of the following,\" and then it lists six items. Subsection (3) is the substantial valuation misstatement penalty that we're relying on here. Subsection (6) is a disallowance of claimed tax benefits by reason of a transaction lacking economic substance. That's the ­­ the 2010 penalty. Now, the two points I would make are, first, it's very clear that many, many cases that would fall under Subsection (6) would also fall under Subsection (1) or (2); that is, they could involve negligence or disregard of rules or regulations. They could also involve a substantial understatement of income tax, which basically means any understatement of income tax that's 10 percent or more of the true tax owed. And so if there's no incongruity in saying Subsection (6) should apply to some cases where (1) and (2) would also apply, there shouldn't be any greater incongruity in saying it can apply to some cases where Subsection (3) would apply. The other point I would make pertains to the introductory language of that provision, and it says, \"This section shall apply to the portion of any underpayment, which is attributable to one or more of the following.\" And I think the primary practical significance of the \"one or more\" language is that it functions as an anti­stacking provision. It tells you it doesn't matter whether your underpayment triggers only one of these penalties or all six of them; you're still limited to 20 percent, unless you can get the ­­ the 40 percent through some other provision. So we can't take advantage of the fact that the ­­ that more than one penalty applies to a particular transaction by getting 20 percent on top of 20 percent on top of 20 percent. But the very fact that Congress used that language \"which is attributable to one or more of the following\" indicates that it anticipated situations in which particular underpayments would be attributable to more than one of those penalties. It didn't see any anomaly in the idea that a penalty that triggers Subsection (3) could trigger Subsection (1) or (2). And, again, there's no reason to think that there's a greater anomaly with respect to Subsection (6). The other thing I would say is that, in this case, (3) and ­­ if it arose in connection with a transaction that occurred today, (3) and (6) would be coterminous. Either of them would apply. But there will be plenty of cases in which a substantial valuation misstatement penalty on our view could be triggered by a legal error in computing basis, such as use of the wrong depreciation rate. That would not ­­",
  "I guess the two things that ­­ or at least two things I would say in response to that are that here the whole point of the avoidance scheme was to create an artificially inflated basis; that is, the high, high basis that's claimed on the individual's returns was not simply a fortuitous result of an avoidance scheme that operated through some other means. The whole point ­­ if you want to claim a loss on a transaction where you didn't incur an actual economic loss, you can do it either by under ­­ by understating the amount that you were paid for the asset or by overstating your basis. And this is one of a number of tax avoidance schemes that operate by overstating basis. So it's true that the transaction was determined to be a sham, but the sham determination was intimately bound up with the fact that the whole purpose of the scheme was to create an inflated basis.",
  "I guess the ­­ the other couple of points I would make are, there's nothing illegal about engaging in a transaction that lacks economic substance; that is, if the partners had engaged in these offsetting currency transactions, but then had decided before filing their return that either we ­­ we no longer believe that this is right conduct or we believe we're going to get caught, and they had prepared their returns in a lawful way, nothing bad would have happened to them. The ­­ the thing that subjects them to potential penalties is the fact that they claimed a large loss on their tax returns, and they did that by claiming a large false basis in the ­­ the partnership. The second thing I would say is ­­ you know, when I took math in junior high and high school, the teacher would always tell us to show your work when you handed in an assignment, don't just give the answer at the end; indicate the process by which you arrived at that number. And in essence, when the code says impose penalties on underpayments that are attributable to the following things, it says ­­ it means we're going to look at your work. When we determine that you have paid too little tax, we're going to look at the calculation process by which you arrived at the amount on your own return and figure out where you went wrong. And if they did that here, they would say the mistake these taxpayers made, the reason that they didn't pay as much tax as they owed, was not that they claimed to have sold the assets ­­ it was not that they claimed to have sold the assets for less than they actually realized; it was that they claimed a basis that had ­­ had no founding in reality. And the last thing I would say in ­­ in connection with that is it's no accident that this scheme operated through the creation of sham partnerships; that is, if the taxpayers themselves had bought the offsetting long and short currency options, there would have been no colorable argument that they could have claimed the costs ­­",
  "Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Kagan, I agree with your point that, on the jurisdictional issue, the crucial contested language is \"relates to,\" and the issue is whether the basis overstatement penalty here relates to the sham ­­",
  "That's correct.",
  "I mean ­­",
  "I think this is a different situation because the IRS did not determine that the underlying transactions, the purchases and sale of currency options and so forth, didn't occur. It determined that the partnerships were shams. And I think that this is an important point.",
  "There were no partnerships ­­",
  "But what the FPAA also said was, because there were no partnerships, the transactions should be treated as though they had ­­ were engaged in by the individual partners.",
  "Well ­­ and I ­­ and I think, as ­­ as I was starting to say at the close of my opening argument, it's no accident that partnerships were used to effectuate this scheme because, if the individuals had bought and sold the offsetting foreign currency options, they would have had no colorable rationale for contending that they were entitled to a deduction for the cost of the long option, but they were not required to treat as income the amount they received from the short option. It would have been absolutely clear that the transaction, taken as a whole, was a wash. The only way that they could try to create the appearance of a paper loss was by manipulating the rules that govern the computation of basis in partnerships. And so the shamming determination, in effect, was a determination that, for tax purposes, you can't try to take advantage of the Helmer rule that says that, for computing basis in a partnership, we will ignore the ­­ the contingent liability created by the short option. The ­­ the one thing ­­ other thing I would say on the merits as to why we care about this case is that Respondent's argument doesn't just go to ­­ on ­­ on Subsection 3, doesn't just go to basis overstatements that are produced through sham transactions. It goes to all basis overstatements that are produced through legal errors. And I think that ­­",

  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In promulgating the Transport Rule, EPA sought to protect the public health and to strike a fair balance between the competing interests of upwind and downwind States. EPA's analysis proceeded in three basic steps. First, EPA performed a screening analysis to determine which upwind States would be covered by the Transport Rule. And in order to do that, EPA first identified the downwind receptors that were in a State of nonattainment or had maintenance difficulties, and then it determined which upwind States were linked to those receptors. And in order to be linked to a downwind receptor, the upwind State had ­­ had to contribute one percent or more of the relevant National Air Quality ­­ Ambient Air Quality standard, or ­­ or NAAQS, to that downwind receptor. And any State that didn't contribute at least one percent to any of the downwind ­­ any of the relevant downwind receptors was determined not to contribute significantly to nonattainment at that area. Second, once the States that were to be covered by the Transport Rule had been identified, EPA set a State emissions budget for each State. And to do that, it performed computer modeling to determine, in addition to whatever emission control efforts were already going on, what additional emission reductions could be achieved by implementation of control measures available at various cost thresholds. And the thresholds ultimately selected were, for NAAQS, $500 per ton. For SO2, the group 1 States were at a level of $2,300 per ton. The group 2 States were 5 ­­ $500 per ton. And the idea was let's see what emissions savings we can achieve, if additional control measures are implemented up to those cost thresholds. And ­­",
  "Well, there ­­ there were two bases for distinguishing among the States. The first ­­ in terms of the $500 per ton threshold for the group 2 States versus the $2,300 per ton threshold; the way in which States were divided into those categories is that the States that were linked to the downwind receptors that had the most severe pollution problems were treated as group 1 States, and they were required to make greater pollution control efforts because they had some responsibility for the most serious problems. Now, I guess the point of your question would go to ­­ to the fact that, even among States that were operating under constant cost control thresholds, a State that had already implemented cost measures up to that limit might have to do less in a sense because it would have already taken the ­­ the steps that were required, at least as compared to an air­quality­only threshold.",
  "Well ­­",
  "I think it is ­­ no, I think it is the case that, if you adopted an air­quality­only threshold, then it would be more likely to be the case that States that had already done a lot to control air pollution would have to take additional steps, even if it was done at a non­cost ­­ in a non­cost­effective way.",
  "I think it would be the case that at least as ­­ yes, as compared to at least some air­quality­only measures, the use of cost would have the effect of distributing the burden in a somewhat different way than it would have if you considered air quality factors only.",
  "That's correct. And that was what I was trying ­­ trying to get out earlier, that if ­­ if States have to do less in order to meet the $500 ­­ in order to be in a position where they've implemented all the cost ­­ all the emission control measures that are available at $500 per ton, if a particular State has to do less in order to achieve that, it's probably because that State has already implemented most of those measures on its own.",
  "Well, the ­­ the term that we're ­­",
  "Well, the statute says that each State will adopt measures that prevent sources within its borders from contributing significantly to downwind nonattainment. And the purpose of the provision is not to allocate blame for an existing state of nonattainment or for prior pollution. It's a ­­ it's to devise a scheme that going forward will prevent nonattainment from occurring. And the idea is, if each State lives up to its obligation and if the downwind States make commensurate commitments, then the problem will be solved. And in terms of the language, \"contribute significantly,\" I think there are ­­ there are various reasons to think that EPA reasonably construed that term to include a component of difficulty of achievement; that is, in common parlance, we might say that dunking a basketball is a more significant achievement for somebody who is 5 feet 10 than for somebody who is 6 feet 10. We might say that a $100 charitable contribution is more significant if it's made by a person who makes $10,000 a year than a 1,000 contribution by somebody who makes $1 million a year.",

But if you're talking about significant contributions to a bad result, you'd more likely to focus on errors that could or ­­ and should have been avoided, not simply the failure to accomplish something that's extraordinarily difficult.",
  "I don't ­­ I don't quite want to go there. I think there's a kernel of truth in there ­­ in that, but that the point at which the State's significant ­­ the point at which the State's good neighbor obligation is triggered is by the promulgation of a new National Air ­­ Ambient Air Quality standard. And the State is required, within 3 years of the promulgation of the NAAQS, to promulgate a State plan that includes good neighbor provisions for ­­ for the particular ­­",
  "In this case, there are two NAAQS that were implemented ­­ that were promulgated in 1997.",
  "One of them for annual particulate matter and one of them for ozone; and then the 2006 NAAQS was for 24­hour particular matter ­­ particulate matter, which is harder to achieve. And ­­ and so when ­­ when we are asking what are the States supposed to do, as of the time that the new NAAQS is promulgated, the States don't exactly get credit for what they have done in the past; that is, they can't do less than they are supposed to do in the future, simply because they have done a lot in prior years to prevent pollution. But the fact that sources within the State have, in the past, installed various pollution control devices or are using cleaner fuels, that may make it easier for them to prevent significant contributions to downwind nonattainment, going forward.",
  "Well, I mean in the case of the NAAQS, I think it was ­­ it was not the case that requiring EPA to establish the NAAQS without reference to cause ­­ to cost, would cause a silly result; that is, the Ambient Air Quality Standards were supposed to be set based on public health criteria. And the Court in ­­ in the same case, in American Trucking, said that, of course, you can consider costs in deciding what is the most efficient and appropriate way to implement those NAAQS. And, here, I take your point that, in order to conclude that Congress barred consideration of costs at the implementation stage, we would have to have very clear language, and \"significant contribution\" doesn't do it. And the other thing I would say, in addition to the examples I've given of ­­ in common parlance, we use \"significance\" to refer to ease or difficulty of achievement. It's worth emphasizing that this is a provision of law, and it's designed to help allocate the responsibility among different actors for alleviating a shared problem. And, for example, suppose ­­",
  "I guess ­­",
  "I mean, the first thing I would say is we ­­ we can accept the premise that each State should alleviate no more than its share, and there still may be ­­ that each State should do no more than its share, and yet, there still may be different ways of determining what a State's fair share is; that is, one way would be to determine which States had been the greatest polluters in the past and say that, the more pollution that had previously flowed from your borders, the greater your reduction obligation in the future. But another way would be to say, in order to ensure that each of the States that have shared responsibility for the problem in the past bears its fair share, we will ask each State to undertake commensurate efforts, as measured by the cost threshold. For example, if it could be shown, somehow, that the generation of electric power inherently required the emission of some level of SO2 and NOx, that there was simply no way to ­­ to generate electricity through any technology known today, without generating ­­ without emitting that minimum amount, I think we would certainly say, well, Congress didn't intend to bury in the good neighbor provision some prohibition against particular States generating electricity. And EPA could ­­ EPA or the States could reasonably determine that the unavoidable component of the emissions, the part that couldn't be avoided, even with the best possible pollution control technology, that would be regarded as legally insignificant; that the only legally significant contribution would be contribution that could have been avoided. Now, clearly, EPA has gone one step farther because it hasn't just focused on emissions that couldn't be avoided at all, at least with ­­ without foregoing the generation of electric power. It has said, we will treat as legally significant only the extra increment of emissions that comes after we've taken what we regard to be equitable and cost­effective pollution control ­­",
  "I misspoke. What the Court said in American Trucking is that in ­­ in setting the NAAQS, EPA was forbidden to consider cost, not because the statute said, in so many words, cost can't be considered, but because the criteria that were set out in the statute for what the NAAQS had to achieve simply couldn't be reconciled with consideration of costs.",
  "But the Court in the same decision said, although you can't consider costs in determining what the NAAQS will be ­­ what air quality standards have to be achieved, of course, you can and should consider costs in deciding what implementation measures should be used to determine which emissions will be reduced.",
  "Let me say three things in response to that. The first is that, as I mentioned before, the good neighbor provision is addressed in the first instance to the States; that is, it's the State's initial obligation to submit an implementation plan that contains good neighbor provisions. And so if the Court says costs can't be considered in defining significant contribution, the effect is not simply that EPA can't consider that factor when it steps into the State's shoes. The effect is that a State can't consider cost of achievement in attempting, in good faith, to implement its own good neighbor provision. The second thing I would say ­­",
  "The good neighbor provision ­­ we're dealing here with a situation where EPA was the one that promulgated Federal implementation plans, but that's only because the States didn't ­­ the relevant upwind States did not discharge their obligation to implement State ­­ promulgate State implementation plans that contain good neighbor provisions. But the language \"contribute significantly\" is in the portion of the statute that deals with what a State plan is supposed to contain. It's not dealing with ­­ it's not in a provision that, by its terms, is addressed directly to EPA. And so if the Court said, in defining \"contribute significantly,\" we can't take into account the cost of emission control measures, that would mean not simply that EPA can't consider that factor when it steps into the State's shoes; it would also mean that the State can't consider that factor.",
  "Well, it's the statute that imposes the obligation on the States. And it may help to draw the Court's attention to the relevant provisions. On page 1a of the appendix to the government's opening brief, the relevant provision is 42 And 7410(a)(1) begins by saying, \"Each State shall, after reasonable notice and public hearings, adopt and submit to the administrator of EPA within 3 years or such shorter period as the administrator may prescribe after the promulgation of a national primary ambient air quality standard, the NAAQS.\" And then it goes on to say, \"A plan which provides for implementation,\" and so forth. And then, if you look to the bottom of ­­ or to the top of page 2a ­­ I'm sorry ­­ subsection (2) begins, \"Each implementation plan submitted by a State under this chapter shall be adopted by the State after reasonable notice and public hearing. Each such plan shall,\" and then if you look at the bottom of the page, it says, \"contain adequate provisions prohibiting, consistent with the provisions of this subchapter, any source or other type of emissions activity within the State from emitting any air pollution in amounts which will contribute significantly to nonattainment\" ­­",
  "Well, certainly, EPA's basic methodology of using ­­ using cost thresholds had been embodied in the ­­ the NAAQS SIP call in 1998, and in CAIR, which I believe was promulgated in 2006.",
  "We would tell them, in all honesty, we don't know yet. But that ­­ that's not a fatal flaw in the argument; that is, it is inherent in any legal context in which one person acts and then a second person reviews, that the first person has to act before the second person has ­­ has made up his or her mind. And so a district court ­­",
  "Well, certainly, what EPA was called upon to do was far more complicated than what any particular State was going to be called upon to do because, as a result of widespread noncompliance, EPA was promulgating Federal implementation plans for close to 30 States and plans for ­­ for different NAAQS. The second thing I would say is that ­­",
  "Well, it certainly has the data available to it that ­­ that EPA had available about how much did each State contribute to the overage at various nonattainer ­­ nonattainment receptors in the past. It's certainly true that the States wouldn't necessarily know exactly what policy judgment EPA would ultimately make as to what the right cost threshold was. But ­­",
  "I guess the second ­­ the other two points I would make are, first, the State's role is to devise something, in this area, as in others, that it believes will carry out its own legal obligations, not necessarily to predict just how EPA would do it if the task fell to EPA. And so, for example, when the States are undertaking a more ­­ the more prosaic task of devising plans that will produce attainment of the NAAQS within their own borders, they have to make a variety of policy judgments about the right mix of emission controls, what sources should be allowed to emit, in ­­ in what amounts. If a particular State just didn't do it, that task would fall to EPA. And it's very unlikely that anything the particular State would come up with would exactly match what EPA would ultimately devise.",
  "Well, the examples I would point to are in the brief filed by the ­­ the Respondent States that are on our side of the case, who identify examples of instances where States did successfully comply with their good neighbor obligations and ­­ and persuaded EPA that what they had done was enough.",
  "I don't ­­ I wouldn't characterize what EPA is doing as hiding the ball; that is, it didn't kind of fail to divulge information that it had its ­­ at its disposal.",
  "It released a great deal of information at the time that the proposed rule was announced in the ­­ the summer of 2010.",
  "But ­­ but I take your point that ­­ the two additional things I would say, though, are that, for better or worse, Congress did place this obligation of the States. It evidently thought that, at least in the mine run of ­­ of cases, States were capable of carrying out this task. And at least to the extent that adopting a good ­­ a good neighbor provision requires consideration of circumstances in other States, in a sense, this is just the flip side of what the downwind States have to do all the time; that is, if New York officials are trying to determine, when a new NAAQS comes out, how can we bring our own air quality into compliance? What controls do we have to place on our own sources, in order to get air quality to the desired level? The New York officials have to take account of the degree of pollution that is likely to travel to their borders from other States. They can't analyze emissions within their own borders in a vacuum. They have to consider what the likely contributions of their neighbors ­­",
  "I guess the final thing I would say on ­­ on this part of the ­­ this particular sub­issue of the case is that, even if you reach that conclusion, even if you determine that it was just practically infeasible for any State to adopt a compliant State implementation plan with good neighbor provisions for these NAAQS until EPA acted, then the proposition of the opposing States still wouldn't follow; that is, the statute in the provisions that I've pointed to says it's up to the States in the first instance to devise the State implementation plans, including good neighbor provisions. And then, on page 10a of the same provision ­­ of the same appendix, I'm sorry ­­ the statute describes what happens if a State fails to satisfy that obligation. And this is at the beginning of subsection (c)(1) on page 10A, it says, \"The Administrator shall promulgate a Federal implementation plan at any time within 2 years after the Administrator finds that a State has failed to make a required submission or finds that the plan or plan revision submitted by the State does not satisfy the minimum criteria.\" And ­­",
  "I mean, I think, in the circumstance you describe, if you reach the conclusion that there was a theoretical possibility that this could happen and that it would be a problem if it did, but that the methodology used by EPA was, on the whole, rational, I think the task for the Court at this stage of the case is to rule on the more big picture objections that are properly before it and ­­ and that the court of appeals ruled on. Now, even if we win everything that's at issue in this Court, the case is not over. There are a variety of more specific challenges to the details of the rule that the D.C. Circuit found it unnecessary to address. And so, if we won on the issues that are before the Court, the case would be remanded, and there would be an opportunity for the court below to consider those. And to the extent ­­",
  "Well, to ­­ to the extent that any State had ­­ and I don't know the ­­ the pending as­applied challenges at this level of detail. But to the extent that any State has a properly preserved challenge to the effect that it is actually likely to be subject to overcontrol, then that could be heard by the court of appeals. The court of appeals could determine both whether that is, in fact, likely to happen and whether, if it does happen, that would render the rule arbitrary and capricious as to that State. But the ­­ the real problem with the court of appeals methodology was that it said the fact that EPA can't absolutely rule out the possibility that it might happen renders the rule invalid on its face, and in other portions of the opinion, the court faulted EPA for failing to ensure that its regime would not lead to overcontrol. And I think that's an extraordinary standard for an administrative agency to deal with; that is ­­ you know, it happens all the time that Federal agencies are given authority to regulate ­­ to address one problem, and the regulation necessarily has spillover effects on other conduct. And so, for instance, if a Federal agency was tasked with preventing the sale in interstate commerce of contaminated food, it might require inspections, it might require the recall of food after one item in a shipment had been shown to be contaminated. These measures might have spillover effects on food that was not, in fact, contaminated. But that wouldn't be a flaw in the rule. Of course, an agency could go overboard and impose a regime that was so onerous in comparison to the health benefits that it was arbitrary and capricious. But nobody would ever say that it's the duty of the agency to ensure that there is no other means of achieving the same health benefits at lower cost to the public. The other thing that the States could do ­­ I mentioned that one way in which a State that believed itself to be unfairly or inappropriately treated by the rule was to pursue any adequately preserved legal challenge it may have in the judicial proceedings. And as your question indicated, there is also a mechanism by which a State can ask to have the Federal implementation plan replaced by a plan of its own devising. And so the consequence of the State's failure to achieve their good neighbor obligations in time and EPA's stepping into their shoes, that ­­ the consequence was not that they're forever barred from devising their own plans. The consequence was simply that the Federal implementation plan would remain in effect for a fairly limited period of time, subject to replacement by a State plan.",
  "I don't have an estimate on the time, but if the Court affirms on the ground that EPA may not consider costs ­­ part of the problem ­­ I think it would be an extraordinary undertaking for EPA to try to achieve; that is, part of the difficulty here is that nobody has identified a concrete alternative; that is, a plan that would not consider costs and that ­­ yet that would disperse the burdens of compliance among the States in proportion to their prior contributions and also would address the nonattainment problem at all of the downwind receptors. I don't know if it could be ­­",
  "What ­­ at least what we understand to be the straight proportionality approach is impossible; that is, it might be possible with respect to any particular downwind receptor because you could say that, if one upwind State is contributing two units and another four and another seven, the proportional solution might be to require that any necessary reduction would be in those proportions. One State would do 2/13ths of the reduction, another would do 4/13ths of the reduction, and another would do 7/13ths of the reduction. That would be theoretically possible, with respect to any receptor. But with respect to another receptor, the same States might be contributing in entirely different proportions, and so there would be no way of devising a solution that would be proportionate as to both.",
  "You might be able to average them out.",
  "Well, I mean, the purpose of the cost threshold was not to increase or decrease the total amount of reductions that would be necessary. It would be to ensure that the reductions that had to take place were done in the most cost­effective manner possible. And part of the irony ­­",
  "Well, I think the cost methodology is one that EPA had used often in the past. Indeed, even before the term \"contribute significantly\" was added to the statute in 1990, EPA had interpreted the prior reading of the statute to allow relief for a downwind State, if an upwind State was contributing significantly to downwind pollution, and it had interpreted that standard as allowing consideration of cost and compliance burdens. I mean, one of the ironic things about this case is that the only ill consequence of overcontrol is cost; that is, this is not a situation in which there is some distinct public health benefit ­­ distinct public health problem ­­ I'm sorry ­­ that is caused if power plants are emitting too little NOx or SO2. The only reason that people worry about overcontrol, about reducing emissions more than they need to be, is that it costs money. And if that's the problem to be avoided, it seems strange that EPA can't take account of costs in devising a solution.",
  "The third part of the process is that, once each State's emissions budget has been quantified, with respect to each State, the EPA essentially divides up the emissions that are allowed among the different power plants within the State's borders. And the way that it does that is it gives allowances to the various power plants that add up to the total number of tons of pollutants that are allowed to be emitted. And it's important to emphasize that the States have not joined the industry's argument here that cost ­­ even the States on the other side of the case have not joined the industry's argument here that states ­­ that costs can't be considered. Those States are not quarreling with the methodology by which EPA quantified their State emission budgets. Those States are simply saying that, once those had been quantified, they should have been given an opportunity to determine, on their own, how the allowances should be allocated without EPA doing it first. In some situations, that might have been a rational way for EPA to proceed; that is, the statute says that once the ­­ once EPA finds that a particular State has either failed to submit a good neighbor SIP or has ­­ or EPA has disapproved the good neighbor SIP, once that happens, the statute says that EPA, at any time within 2 years, can promulgate its own Federal implementation plan. And in some circumstances, it might be rational for EPA to wait the full 2 years and give additional guidance to States, in order to give them every opportunity to devise compliant plans. There were basically two reasons that EPA didn't do that here. The first is that it was subject to the D.C. Circuit's mandate in North Carolina, which said get something in place that works as soon as possible, and EPA felt constrained by that to act as quickly as it could. And the second point worth emphasizing is that there are State sovereign interests on both sides of the case. It's true that, by devising a Federal plan, in the first instance, EPA has intruded to a degree on the ability of the upwind States to decide how emissions allowances should be allocated among their own sources. But the downwind States are subject to their own obligations to comply with the NAAQS within their own borders, and to the extent that they can't get relief from the upwind States, their task is made more difficult.",
  "Yes. I mean, with respect to the particular NAAQS that are at issue here, the States ­­ it's unclear to what extent they've been working on this in the interim, but the States certainly could, even under the terms of the transport rule, propose State implementation plans to replace the FIPs. Now, it's to be contemplated that there will be additional NAAQS implemented, and this Court's decision would affect the way in which both the States and EPA went about the business of determining how good neighbor obligations should be carried out with respect to those future NAAQS.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. As Mr. Keisler indicated, in our reply brief, we cited the ­­ the history of the restatement as it bears on the common law of nuisance. And as this Court indicated in American Electric Power, if the Clean Air Act had not been enacted, the remedy that downwind States would have in a situation like this one would be a Federal common law nuisance suit against upwind States or polluters in upwind States. And I think there are three lessons to draw from that fact. The first is that, as the briefs and argument in this case indicate, judicial resolution of such a suit would have been a Herculean task. And the prospect of doing that through judicial processes should reinforce the wisdom of Congress' choice to replace that mechanism with the Clean Air Act, and it counsels in favor of deference to the expert agency that has been placed in the position that a common law court would previously have been placed in. The second is that, as the reply brief citation to the law of nuisance indicates, the common law court in that scenario would have been able to consider the costs necessary to achieve reduction in pollution upwind in deciding whether a particular remedy would be appropriate or how much of a reduction an upwind polluter should have to make. And there's no reason, absent extraordinarily clear statutory language, to deny EPA the same authority. The third thing is, as the analogy to the common law suit indicates, there are sovereign State interests on both sides of this case. This is not a matter of EPA versus the States. It's a matter of EPA trying to act as an honest broker between the upwind and downwind States. The next thing I would say about the Clean Air Act is that the statute, as a whole, is replete with references to economic activity and harnessing the profit motive; that is, both the States and EPA are specifically authorized to provide for the trading of allowances, the whole purpose of which is to achieve emission reductions in the most cost­effective manner possible. And I think it's worth noting in this regard that, although we talk about the transport rule as regulating the emission of ­­ emissions of States, what we're really regulating is emissions of power plants within the States, and the good neighbor provision, itself, talks about preventing significant contribution from emissions sources or emissions activity within the States. And one of the things that the EPA said in the proposed rulemaking was that, in some circumstances, the cumulative downwind impact of a particular upwind State might be great, not because any particular power plant was poorly regulated or emitting at a high level, but because there were so many power plants in the same State. And one consequence of forbidding the EPA to consider costs is that a particular power plant in an upwind State might be required to install more expensive pollution control measures and make greater reductions, simply because it happened to be located in a State with a lot of other power plants. And the last thing I would say is this is ­­ the statute, as I've said before, has prospective focus. It's intended to be implemented by State officials, and if you ask how would a State official assure herself or feel confident that her own State implementation plan was satisfying good neighbor obligations, when she wasn't really sure what other States might be doing, and one way is if a State official said, if everybody else did what I'm doing, I can feel confident that the problem would be solved. And that's really the approach that EPA used. It examined certain cost thresholds, and it said, at particular cost thresholds, we feel confident that if everyone, upwind and downwind State alike ­­ alike makes pollution control efforts at these levels, the problem will be solved or at least almost solved because there would still be slight residual nonattainment. And it seems perfectly rational to say that the significant contribution is the amount over and above what would occur, if everyone adhered to an approach which, if applied across the board, would solve the problem. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin by addressing two of the respects in which the Petitioners' counsel argued that circumstances have changed since this Court's decision in Basic. And the first ­­ one of these was that investors have adopted new strategies that, in his view, don't rely on the integrity of the market price. And I think it's certainly true that investors have devised a wide array of strategies in an effort to beat the market, but it's hard to imagine one that would render irrelevant evidence that the market price had been distorted by fraud. For example, a particular investor might think there are particular types of information that the market doesn't react to quickly enough, and if I'm following that information in realtime and I can trade before the market catches on, then I can make money; I can buy low and sell high. Now, that strategy is certainly going to be undermined if there is other information bearing on the market price, the falsity of which that investor is not aware of that caused the market price to be inflated. Now, I'd ­­ would agree with you, Justice Alito, that in theory, there could be an investor who says in a particular circumstance, I think the gain that I can make by taking advantage of the new information to which the market price has not yet reacted will more than counterbalance the loss I will suffer when the truth about the unrelated information comes to light. That could happen, but even for an investor of that sort, the distortion wouldn't be irrelevant. It would just be a factor that could be counteractive. And the other thing I would say about the efficiency of the market is that even an investor who is attempting to make money by being the first to take advantage of new information is relying, in essence, on the ultimate ability and tendency of the market to incorporate the information; that is, an investor who thinks that a stock is currently undervalued based on the information he has presumably thinks that in time, the ­­ the stock will no longer be undervalued, the market will come to appreciate the significance of the new information. That would be the basis for his anticipating that the stock price will rise. And so even that strategy is dependent in a fundamental way on the propensity of new information to ­­ to change the market price. The second thing I wanted to respond to was Petitioners' assertion that Basic is out of keeping with this Court's more recent decisions regarding the requirements of Rule 23. And I think that in fact, with ­­ at least with respect to the interaction between the merits and Rule 23, the court in Basic did precisely what this Court's decisions in Wal­Mart and Comcast tell courts they ought to do; that is, the Court in Basic was ruling on an appeal from a class certification decision, and it was confronted with two competing visions of what the reliance requirement of the Section 10(b) action should comprise. One of them was the defendant's view that to establish reliance, a plaintiff had to show that he or she actually read the relevant disclosure and took it into account in making a trading decision. The other vision of reliance was the fraud­on­the­market presumption that the ­­ the court ultimately adopted. And the court in Basic recognized that it had to decide this merits question at the class certification stage because the answer to that question would control whether the reliance element was susceptible of common proof.",
  "If the ­­ I'm sorry.",
  "I don't know exactly what mode. I believe that event studies in some form were used to establish both the efficiency of the market and the potential impact of the misstatement on the price. I don't know the extent to which their sophistication matched the sophistication of event studies today. I would tend to assume that they were much less sophisticated than they are now.",
  "I think the ­­ the theory in Amgen is that in order to decide whether something has to be proved at the class certification stage, you ask first, is it susceptible of common proof; and second, if the class is certified and the ­­ the statement or the fact is ultimately disproved down the road, is the effect going to be that the class splinters or that all plaintiffs lose in common? And the Court's theory in Amgen, the rationale for saying that publicity had to be proved at the class certification stage, was that if it were proved down the road that the statement was not made publicly, some plaintiffs might still have good claims because they would have heard and relied upon the information even though it wasn't communicated to the public, and therefore the effect of disproof of publicity would not be to cause all class members to lose, it would be to cause the class to splinter.",
  "Well, there ­­ there are certainly plenty of securities fraud cases over the years that involved private misrepresentations made one­on­one by a broker, a salesperson, et cetera. I take your point that in terms of practical significance it is the case that the recoveries in the large class actions dwarf the ones in individual suits.",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "Well, at least to the efficiency of the market, it wouldn't ­­ it wouldn't be the case that disproof of efficiency would defeat the claim of every class member.",
  "Because a particular class member, even without showing an efficient market, could show that he or she personally ­­",
  "If the class were defined in that manner, as people who had no such information, then ­­ then the class wouldn't splinter.",
  "Well, let me take the first part first, because I think in part it illustrates an important aspect of this case that tends to get lost. We are arguing about this as though it's procedure, but really what is fundamentally at issue is what is the class of, what is the category of investors who would have a potentially valid Section 10(b)(5) action. That is, the Petitioners' view is the only people who could be proper plaintiffs in a Section ­­ in a private Section 10(b) suit, whether a class action or an individual action, are people who personally read, reviewed, subjectively took account of the false information. And the view on the other side, the view under ­­ under Basic, is that any person who bought stock at the inflated price on the market, a price inflated by fraud, and subsequently lost money as a result when the truth was made known, any such person would have a remedy; and if Basic were overruled, if people were told, if you buy without doing this sort of research into primary sources, you will have no potential recovery at the end of the day, I don't know that the SEC has a defined view about exactly what the consequences would be, but certainly the consequences are potentially dramatic. You have an amicus brief filed by institutional investors, many of whom rely on indexing strategies, and they try to save management fees by not doing all the research into the primary sources, by allowing the market to do most of the work, and then buying stocks that are broadly representative of the market. And they've at least ­­",
  "Well, the SEC would have no ­­ wouldn't and would have no need to do so, because reliance wouldn't be an element of the SEC's cause of action. The SEC would have to establish that there was a violation, but it wouldn't have to establish that it or any individual investor relied; and so the institutional investors at least have represented to the Court that their investment strategies will need to change if they have to choose between saving money by relying on indexing strategies and having available potential avenues for recovery if it turns out ­­",
  "I understand the law professors, that there were a few law professors' briefs. And I understand the one you're referring to to be the one that basically advocated a shift away from analyzing the general efficiency of the market and focusing only on the effect or lack of effect on the ­­ the particular stock. I don't think that the consequences would be nearly so dramatic. In fact if anything, that would be a net gain to plaintiffs, because plaintiffs already have to prove price impact at the end of the day.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to begin by reinforcing two of the points that Mr. Clement made. The first is that what Aereo is doing is really the functional equivalent of what Congress in the 1976 Act wanted to define as a public performance. As the Chief Justice said, one potential way of looking at this is that Aereo and companies like it are not providing services, they are simply providing equipment that does, in a more sophisticated way, what the viewer himself can do. It's a plausible way of looking at the world. That's what the Court in Fortnightly and Teleprompter said, but Congress acted to override that and to make clear that cable services, services that used one big antenna to pull broadcast signals out of the sky and reroute it to their subscribers, those people were engaged in public performances and they ought to be paying royalties. The second thing that I would like to reinforce in Mr. Clement's presentation is that there is no reason that a decision in this case should imperil cloud locker services generally, but, as Mr. Clement was pointing out, that the term \"cloud computing\" ­­",
  "I guess I'm not familiar enough with the precise details of the operation, but just let me say in general terms there are obviously services that provide television programming over the Internet. Some of them are licensed because they recognize that they are publicly performing. If a particular company, for instance, recorded television programs and offered to stream them to anyone who paid the fee or offered to stream them for free and made its money off advertising, that would be a public performance because those companies would be providing content to people who didn't have it. I think the basic distinction, the one that at least defines the extremes, is the distinction between the company, whether it be Internet­based or a cable transmitter, that provides content in the first instance and the company that provides consumers with access to content that they already have. If you have a cloud locker service, somebody has bought a digital copy of a song or a movie from some other source, stores it in a locker and asks that it be streamed back, the cloud locker and storage service is not providing the content. It's providing a mechanism for watching it.",
  "I think you would have to ­­ you would have to know both the details of the service and you would have to be making a harder call there about how to draw the line, because I don't pretend that there is a bright line between providing a service and providing access to equipment. If you look, for instance, at the extremes of a person putting a rooftop antenna at his own home, everybody agrees that the rooftop antenna manufacturer is not performing at all and the individual is engaged in a solely private performance. The other extreme is the cable company, one big antenna, makes transmissions to a lot of people; Congress clearly intended to define that as a private performance. Somewhere in the ­­ you could come up with lots of hypotheticals that look more or less like one of the other extremes, they are somewhere in the middle. It's an authentically hard call as to where to draw the line. So I don't have a good answer for you.",
  "No, they're not ­­",
  "Because the definition of \"to transmit\" goes on: \"To transmit a performance or display is to communicate it by any device or process whereby images or sounds are received beyond the place from which they are sent.\"",
  "Well, there is a separate exclusive right in the Copyright Act.",
  "No. No. I have thought about it. And I think the answer is that the word \"transmit\" is being used in a particular sense. You are correct that there are some contexts in which we would say that a person who sends CDs or vital albums over the mails is transmitting those. That's not the sense in which the term \"transmit\" is used here. It's talking about transmitting in a way that causes the sights and sounds to be received, transmission through radio waves, through cable, et cetera. And if there were any doubt about the word \"transmit,\" remember that it's part of the definition of the word \"perform.\" And ambiguities in the definition should be construed in light of the defined term. And nobody would say, in ordinary parlance, that a person who transferred a copy of a record was performing it.",
  "We haven't made that argument. We ­­ we believe that existing U.S. copyright law properly construed is fully sufficient to comply with our international obligations. But that ­­ that doesn't mean that we think that whenever a court misconstrues the statute, we will automatically be thrown into breach. It's certainly possible. But if this case were decided in Aereo's favor that some of our international trading partners might object, but ­­ but I'm not going to take the position that we would concede those objections had merit, so we're not making that argument. The other thing I would make ­­ say to ­­ to reinforce the point that Mr. Clement was making about the phrase \"to the public,\" using his example of the valet parking, using a comparable example of a coat checkroom, there are situations all the time in which people place property momentarily at the disposal ­­ disposal of another and then retrieve it later. And it's distributed to them at that later date, not in their capacities as members of the public, but as the true owners of the property. And I think some kind of distinction along those lines is essential in much more mundane applications of the Copyright Act. For example, if I invite 10 friends over to watch the Super Bowl, that's a private performance. It's not a public performance. That's ­­ that's not because my friends are not members of the public. They are. And in some other capacities, it would be important to regard them as such. If the theater down the street had a screening of Casablanca and it happened that those 10 people were the only 10 people who attended, it would be a public performance, because they would be in there in their capacities as members of the public. So I think for ­­ in a wide range of situations dealing with public performance, distribution to the public, it's essential to ask not only are these individuals members of the public in some sense, but are they acting in their capacities as such. And if you have the pure cloud locker service, the service that doesn't provide content, it simply stores content and then plays it back at the user's request, that ­­ that service would be providing content to its true owner.",
  "My answer would be the same as Mr. Clement's, that the reasoning of CableVision, if you really adhere to the idea that the only trans ­­ the only performance that counts is the individual transmission, and ask does that go to more than one person, then it's hard to see how you could rule in favor of our position here. But as far as the bottom line outcome of CableVision is concerned, you could accept the government's position and still say CableVision was decided the correct way because ­­ precisely because CableVision had a license to perform in real time, to broadcast the program to its subscribers. The only thing that was at issue was the supplemental RSDVR service. And the court in CableVision appropriately, we think, held that the recording of those programs by the subscribers who were already entitled to view them in real time was fair use under Sony and the playback can reasonably be characterized as a private performance of their own content. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Defenders of Wildlife, the Court gave the following description of what injury in fact means: It said injury in fact is, quote, \"an invasion of a legally­protected interest which is, A, concrete and particularized, and, B, actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\" And so the injury part of it was the invasion of a legally­protected injury ­­ interest. And I think it's clear what work the words \"in fact\" are doing in that description. If Mr. Robins had alleged that Spokeo is circulating a lot of inaccurate consumer reports and I'm afraid they'll do one about me, that wouldn't be good enough. That ­­",

  "It did. It's ­­",

And obviously the statute in ­­ that we're dealing with here doesn't come anywhere close to that. And ­­ and I understand the Court's concerns with the implications of our position, but I think it's also worth pointing out, this is a mode of enforcement that Congress has been using since 1790.

  "Yes.",
  "I ­­ I think when we get to the point of ­­ of the hypothetical where any unemployed person in the State is treated as the legal vitamin of every act of unlawful immigration that occurs into that State, we ­­ we do have concerns. But the ­­ the statute we're dealing with here says ­­",

Here the statute we're dealing with doesn't say ­­",
  "I think that's still probably too ­­ too broad a class. And I understand the allure of the hypotheticals, but you could do the same thing with rational­basis review of substantive legislation. You could come up with endless hypotheticals about statutes that were just at the border between really stupid and so stupid as to be actually irrational.",
  "Well, the point is ­­ I was trying to make was that Congress has been doing this since 1790, and nobody's pointed to a statute that comes close to the hypotheticals. But to ­­ to return to the point about injury in fact, the Court has said there has to be actual injury. But it has defined \"injury\" as the invasion of a legal ­­ legally­protected interest, the violation of a legal right.

  "Well, what ­­",
  "And at ­­ the Court has also said that Congress can't give every citizen an ­­ an entitlement to sue simply by calling it a legal right.

  "Exactly.",

  "I'm sorry I don't have the exact wording in front of me, but if you look at the very first sentence of the Ninth Circuit's opinion, the Ninth Circuit says, \"the question we confront is whether a person has injury in fact when false information about him is disseminated.\" Now, the ­­ the Court said we don't have to decide what is added to the complaint by the allegations that employment prospects were actually harmed. And it's ­­ and it's also true that the Ninth Circuit didn't analyze the question that it framed in quite the way we would have. It didn't rely on the defamation analogy; it relied on the statutory right. But it still described the question before it as whether a person has injury to complain about ­­",
  "The ­­ the other point I would make ­­ I ­­ I agree with that. And the other point I would make about Defenders of Wildlife is the statute at issue in that case said any person can sue to complain about particular types of Endangered Species Act violations. And the Court said, that's just too broad. Congress can't do that. But it didn't say, therefore, the authorization to sue is a nullity, and we don't have to worry about whether this plaintiff has standing to sue. It analyzed in depth the allegations and the evidence that the particular plaintiffs in Defenders of Wildlife had put forward and said this is insufficient. And then later, in Bennett v. Spear, the Court applied the same Endangered Species Act provision at the behest of a plaintiff who did have standing. So it isn't the case that, if Congress fails to draw exactly the right line, people who would have been within the right line are out of luck. I think the allegations of the complaint are ­­ are the important thing to focus on. With ­­ with respect to the defamation analogy, I'd say Congress, in one sense, is broader than common law, and in another sense it's narrower. It's broader in that the statute certainly sweeps in categories of types of falsehoods ­­ May I finish? ­­ types of falsehoods that wouldn't have been defamation per se at common law. On the other hand, it applies only to Consumer Reports, documents that are intended to be used for concrete, primarily economic purposes. Thank you."
