  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Multiple purpose projects throughout the country operate like the Friant Division of the Central Valley project, which collects water behind Friant Dam to avert flooding along the San Joaquin River and then gradually releases that water to serve both flood control and irrigation needs.",
  "Justice O'Connor, we don't know why --",
  "Well, you focus on what the reality is.",
  "It serves multiple purposes, Justice O'Connor. The water that is released into the Madera Canal for 10 months out of every year has to comply with flood control rules set by the Corps of Engineers. The Bureau of Reclamation cannot release that water, and it must make daily decisions about how much water goes into the canal, and which canal it goes into, and whether it goes in the downstream river, and for that reason --",
  "Wrong. That is --",
  "That is incorrect. What the agreement says is that the Government can put water into the canal, and it can be flood water, and even the water that the irrigators take and use for irrigation can serve flood control reasons if it has to be released from Millerton Lake to avert a flood, or if putting that water down the San Joaquin River would cause a flood, the dam operator diverts it into the irrigation canals --",
  "That would be --",
  "Well, first, the fact that they have asserted in their complaint that it serves an irrigation purpose is not legally relevant to the question of whether sovereign immunity applies, because sovereign immunity is jurisdictional, and the court must satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think there's any way that the plaintiffs could show that in this case.",
  "Justice O'Connor, Congress, when it created this project in the 1930's, was facing a fact that between 1900 and 1944 there were 38 devastating floods along the San Joaquin River, and it, in the course of its legislative fact-finding, determined that the way to deal with flooding along this river was to harness that river and then to put it to productive use. Of those 38 floods, 15 were from rain during the period between October 1 and roughly March 15, 23 from snow melt run-off --",
  "We do defend --",
  "Well, Justice --",
  "That's correct.",
  "Yes.",
  "No. No.",
  "We disagree with that. The 1937 Rivers and Harbors Act said the entire Central Valley project is for, among other purposes, flood control. It's undisputed that --",
  "I don't think so, Justice Kennedy, and the reason is the congressional design behind the project, as one of your earlier questions pointed out, it is an integrated project, and the part of the report that you were talking about, if all parties agree, those parties are the Bureau of Reclamation and the Corps of Engineers.",
  "The way, Mr. Chief Justice, courts have consistently looked at the question of what is a flood water is, is that water that would overflow the banks unless controlled by man-made structures, and that was the assumption that the Court in James made behind having the water behind this dam be deemed flood waters. If the waters not controlled by that dam would overflow the river, then it would be deemed flood waters and that's --",
  "And our submission, Justice Breyer, is that the -- first we can show as a matter of historical fact that that's not the case here, that --",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, our brief demonstrates that even if you take class I water out of the picture, and class I water in many circumstances would have to be released for flood storage reasons --",
  "Justice Breyer, a flood control project is created for the cataclysm.",
  "Justice Breyer, to answer your question, one must look at the flood rules that are set down by the Corps of Engineers with respect to this project. They were set out in 1955, and --",
  "Well, you -- the Congress didn't define the term, flood waters, Mr. Chief Justice. This Court in James defined the term flood waters in section 702(c), but what the Corps of Engineers has done in flood control projects is to set out the rules for how those projects operate so that waters do not become floods, and in the establishment of those rules the Corps made very clear that water has to be diverted from Millerton Lake to the canals that are adjoining the dam so that flooding --",
  "To the contrary, Mr. Chief Justice, for sovereign immunity to be a functional principle, the Government should be entitled to go into court to say Congress and the applicable agencies have designed and operated this facility for flood control reasons and avoid --",
  "To the contrary, Justice O'Connor. The entire Central Valley project uses aqueducts and canals --",
  "Okay. Let me see if I can help, then. In James what the Court said was that flood waters within the meaning of the immunity statute is all waters carried in or contained through a flood control project for purposes of or related to flood control.",
  "We don't think so, Justice O'Connor, for this reason. On an average year, Millerton Lake will have 1.7 million acre feet of run-off into it. That's the average year. It has to empty itself, or it has to be emptied, and then it will refill three-and-a- half times during the course of the year. If that water is not released there will be a flood. If it's not controlled, there will be a flood along the San Joaquin River.",
  "And the fact that there is a multiple benefit, and the hydropower is another benefit, does not mean that the water loses its character as flood water if it is stored to protect against a flood along the river, and what -- in James this Court considered the question of flood waters that were being used for recreational purposes. The specific discharge that was at issue in that case was deemed to be for flood control reasons. But here, the same principle applies because the water is released into the irrigation canals for a flood control purpose.",
  "To the contrary.",
  "Because every release from Millerton Lake has to serve a flood control purpose, number 1.",
  "Justice Breyer, if I could answer your question in two ways. The first is, if this complaint alleged a discrete release of water, there might be an argument that the Government was not entitled to immunity under your theory because the discrete purpose of the release could be identified. But this complaint asserts that this canal has leaked, and on page 54 of the joint appendix they say, we don't know when the leaking started, so you have to look at the overall purposes of the project, and you have to look at the reasons why water gets released from Friant Dam.",
  "Well, my --",
  "Okay. My comment is that if you're looking at why Congress would have put billions of dollars into these water projects, it did so with the assumption that the immunity would apply, and that is a very important principle here, because when establishing sovereign immunity principles you don't allow the Government to be engaged in fact-finding. They've asked for every single document relating to this project since the 1930's as part of their discovery effort.",
  "Because this is property damage, Justice Stevens.",
  "It -- the Court --",
  "In 1936, when Congress directed the Corps of Engineers in the Flood Control Act of 1936 to study the San Joaquin River and figure out a way to stop flooding on the San Joaquin River, it incorporated by reference the 1928 flood act which contains the immunity provision in this case. In 1937, Congress then authorized --",
  "Well, no, but the case of United States v. Cress had been in present -- by -- decided by this Court, and the question of whether or not and when flooding would constitute a taking.",
  "And so the issue was very much how will Congress protect the Government from paying out in lawsuits for faulty structures or negligent design or damage from flood waters, you know, for decades out into the future, and the interrelationship between the flood control purpose and irrigation is probably the most important thing that we would like the Court to understand here, because you cannot segregate the purposes. They're all serving these purposes simultaneously.",
  "Yes.",
  "When, in an accident --",
  "The discrete situation.",
  "Well, first it would be --",
  "First, it would be an unusual way to treat subject matter jurisdiction of the courts, on an apportionment basis.",
  "When you were talking about the project itself and how the project --",
  "Well, I --",
  "No, I don't think so, Justice Souter --",
  "-- and the reason is that Congress wanted there to be broad immunity. It drafted this statute in the broadest possible --",
  "No.",
  "No, I -- no, Justice Souter, I think there ought to be a discrete -- I think conceptually there are two different problems dealing with this statute. James dealt with the conceptual problem of an accident occurring in flood waters within a project and is there a relationship between the accident that occurs and the flood control purpose of the project, and what the Court there said was, if it -- if the accident is related to the purposes of the flood control project, the immunity applies.",
  "This --",
  "This problem, Justice Souter, is really at the core of what Congress was getting at in 1928 which is, we're going to pour billions of dollars into building these structures to protect flood water, and we --",
  "No, but Mr. Chief Justice, when Congress created the extensive levee system it spent four times the amount that it had on the Panama Canal, and it also appropriated money in the 1928 act to put dams on the Sacramento River and to protect against flooding on the Sacramento River, which is integrated in the water system with the San Joaquin River.",
  "Yes.",
  "Justice Scalia, first the Court took a different view in James, and that view is certainly --",
  "No, those waters were captured behind the dam, and they were being released to create more flood storage space in that lake, just as here, the waters released into the irrigation canals to create more flood storage space --",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "We can because in -- the way the project was designed, in 1944 the Corps of Engineers reported back to Congress and it said that if more than 7,000 cubic feet per second of water is released into the San Joaquin River there will be a flood at Skagg's Branch, and it also said the flood capacity of the dam is 12,000 cubic feet per second, and if you add 1,000 for the Madera Canal and 4,000 for the Friant Current Canal, it is unmistakably clear the Corps of Engineers intended for these canals to receive the flood waters.",
  "Justice Breyer --",
  "-- as a factual matter --",
  "-- 4 out of the last 5 years, if the water had not been put into the canals, there would have been flooding on the San Joaquin River.",
  "Through some months.",
  "-- through months-long periods.",
  "That's related to flood control --",
  "Because they are making space so that floods don't occur in those months.",
  "No.",
  "The water's left the Federal project. It's -- that's --",
  "Yes, and --",
  "Right, but in your hypothetical the Madera district is operating those cut-off valves.",
  "Okay. Okay.",
  "Then there would be --",
  "Yes.",
  "No. That would be immunity. I mean, if the Government's actions are negligent in releasing the water, the immunity applies. The statute says --",
  "Yes. Yes. That's water that's inundating an area where it is not supposed to be. That's the definition of a flood.",
  "Inundating an area where the water is not supposed to be.",
  "We do.",
  "We think we do, Justice Kennedy.",
  "Yes.",
  "There's no difference in our view from an overflow and a leak if the structure isn't working properly --",
  "Yes, and every court of appeals has so held.",
  "Yes.",
  "If the project is a flood control project and there is a relation to flood control, the courts have upheld the Government's immunity.",
  "Yes, and that would be --",
  "Where a Government official like a Fish & Wildlife Service official is on a flood control facility, commits an act of negligence that causes a person to drown --",
  "-- that would not be covered by the immunity.",
  "It -- arguably, yes. Yes.",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, let me just say that the Ninth Circuit itself is not wholly consistent on this point. In the McCarthy case, which was a personal negligence case, the Ninth Circuit said there must be a substantial factor between the Government's activities and the accident, so even in the McCarthy case the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit did not strictly hew to its wholly-unrelated standard. But I would point out --",
  "That's correct.",
  "No. The immunity would apply to negligence cases, too, Justice Souter, for precisely --",
  "For precisely the same reason. That's flood water --",
  "Well, let me distinguish between --",
  "Yes. Escaping waters cases, which is what this one is. This water is not where it's supposed to be. It has escaped from the project. Congress built the project to keep the water contained, and that project is --",
  "-- collectively failing, is foursquare within what Congress debated in the 1928 act. It wanted these structures to succeed, but it did not want the Government to have to defend lawsuits like this one for time immemorial if they did not.",
  "Justice Breyer, I conceded that if you were not to accept our broad view of every release being for flood control, that you would then look at whether or not there was a relation between the release and flood control activities.",
  "Yes. I mean --",
  "That's correct. It is a totally integrated system, but Justice Breyer, if you were not to accept our broadest submission, even under our narrower submission we should prevail and get immunity in this case, because it can be shown through contracts, through regulations, through statutes that this canal serves and is related to a flood control purpose, and the empirical water data collected by the U.S. Geological Service that we quoted in our brief indicates that well over half of the water released in the last 20 years undoubtedly serves a flood control purpose. I mean, you know --",
  "No. This was done on the pleadings, Mr. Chief Justice, and we are allowed to defend the judgment on an alternate ground and to provide public record material --",
  "Well, in a way this is and this is not an alternate ground. It is support for the judgment and the rationale for the judgment by showing the relation of flood control in this particular project, and we have --",
  "Not when they're legal sources, Justice Ginsburg. This is the statutes. This is the regulations. This is historical public record material. This is stipulations they have agreed to in the stipulations of fact.",
  "No, you don't need to understand all the terms of the contract to get the central point, which is that --",
  "No, Justice Stevens. What we want you to know is that the contract provides for flood water to be put into the Madera Canal, and therefore it serves a flood control purpose. That's all you really need to understand about the contract, because it is a matter that they've stipulated to, this is how the water gets into the canal, and the parties have agreed that flood water will be put into the canal as a matter of agreement. So when you look, Justice Ginsburg, at the sources that we have relied upon to defend the judgment and the rationale of the court of appeals, there is not anything that would be developed by going back. All that would be accomplished is that the Government would be forced to defend, you know, document requests that called for every scrap of paper in the Central Valley project and in the Madera Canal over the last 65 years, and the question of sovereign immunity would not be one that could be established at the pleadings stage. It would, in fact, be subject to proof at every step of the way, and this Court has made clear that not only is sovereign immunity a principle of jurisdiction, but it -- to prevent against the Government being liable, but it's also a principle to avoid the Government having to defend against vexatious litigation.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our position is that banks for cooperatives under the Farm Credit Act are not exempt from State income taxes for two reasons. We think the Court should confine its decision to an analsyis of the text of the Farm Credit Act, and not go beyond it to discuss or address the constitutional issues relating to Federal instrumentalities. Under the text of the act itself there are two reasons why banks for cooperatives are not exempt from State income taxes. First, as the State counsel noted, at section 2134, the first sentence itself just addresses an exemption for notes, debentures, and obligations. That provision contrasts with two other provisions of the Farm Credit Act that specifically give State income tax exemptions for other entities of the farm credit system. 12 U.S.C. 2023 provides an exemption from State income taxes for farm credit banks and provides expressly that Congress intended for those entities to be exempt from State income taxes. Moreover, 12 U.S.C. 2098 provides an express exemption from State income taxes for Federal land bank associations. It's clear, therefore, that when Congress enacted this statute, and it amended it over a 50-year period, it knew precisely how to give the kind of exemption from State income taxes being asserted by respondents in this case and chose not to do so. Secondly, the history behind this provision, as the Stte counsel made perfectly clear, does not support respondent's position. Between 1933 and 1985, the text itself provided for the exemption from State income taxes only in any part of a year in which the Government owned stock. That ended in 1968. From a period between 1965 and 1968, the Government retired all of its shares of stock in banks for cooperatives. So as of 1968, and this is reflected in the Farm Credit Administration's annual report, banks for cooperatives were not exempt from Federal and State income taxes. When Congress made its amendment nearly two decades later, in the 1985 Farm Credit Amendments Act, there was no Government ownership in any banks for cooperatives. These were completely privately owned for- profit entities and, as such, would have been subject to State income taxes throughout the entire period. Now, the last point that I'd like to make is that the Court should not reach out to opine about instrumentality status generally. This -- the Court consistently under the Farm Credit Act has looked at the text of the act to determine the scope of exemptions from taxation, and that's true in all of the cases that have been cited by the parties under the Farm Credit Act. It should not use this case to opine broadly about what instrumentalitiy status means for several reasons. First, Congress uses the term, instrumentality, in a broader range of contexts, and even in this case and in this statute itself, has used it to describe not only the organizations that are being used to facilitate Congress' purpose, but also the financial instruments themselves. Section 2023, which is the Farm Credit Bank tax exemption provision, describes the notes themselves as the instrumentalities of the United States, and so by making a decision about what instrumentality status means, the Court could end up having -- could create unintended consequences that would affect the taxable status of instrumentalities throughout the Government.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, that is certainly an area that Congress would certainly want to address. The question, though, is, by using that term, and I would give a second reason, and that's that Congress imposes certain obligations on agencies and instrumentalities that are apart from tax questions, reporting obligations for data to the Secretary of Commerce, encouraging --",
  "No, Justice Stevens. What the Court would say is that use of the instrumentality language by itself would not render the rest of the tax exemption language in the Farm Credit Act surplusage, and the Court would say that Congress defined the scope of the tax exempt status of these particular instrumentalities by expressly dealing with tax exempt status, and that's how the court did it in the First Agricultural Bank case in 1968, when it addressed a very similar question for the national banks, and there the Court said, we're going to look at the text of the statute to determine the scope of the exemption and not reach --",
  "That's correct, where there is express tax-exempt language given by Congress. I mean, even in McCulloch itself the Court said that it was up to Congress to decide how it wanted to exercise its powers under the Necessary and Proper Clause.",
  "Well, we think that the '85 language which is present here is, in and of itself, sufficient, but it is also supported by the history of the statutory evolution from 1933, which makes perfectly clear Congress did not intend for these entities to be tax- exempt when the Government did not own shares in them. If the Court has no further questions, I have nothing further.",
  "Yes, we did.",
  "Well, the statutory authority would have been under quiet title principles. This -- the purpose of this action was to quiet title in the lands.",
  "That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "There certainly are very serious issues at stake here. Tribal ownership of the souther -- tribal ownership of the southern third of Lake Coeur d'Alene implicates such issues as the extent to which the tribe can have a role in anti-pollution measures for the lake, what consequences would flow from pollution of tribally owned lands, as well as to the extent to which the tribe could regulate non-Indian uses on the southern third of the lake.",
  "Well, it would have to work with the Corps of Engineers which would have paramount authority under various laws, but yes, that would be one of the questions.",
  "Well under the Rivers and Harbors Act the Corps of Engineers has control over navigable waterways.",
  "That's correct. That's correct. But from the United States' point of view one of the reasons why this case is so important is because it involves the good faith of the United States. In 1891 when Congress ratified this statute it ratified understandings that had been reached between United States negotiators and it is unthinkable that Congress under the equal footing doctrine would have conveyed the submerged lands to all of the lake while simultaneously negotiating to ratify an agreement that would convey the southern third to the tribe.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, here the negotiating history makes quite clear on page 183.",
  "The Statehood Disclaimer Act, Mr. Chief Justice, disclaims --",
  "I recognize that, but what it does show is Congress' intent to ratify the Constitution disclaiming that the State would not have any interest in lands owned or held by the United States -- held by the tribe until the United States extinguished title.",
  "It was well-known, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "To everyone who was involved in the negotiations and the dealings between the United States and the tribe.",
  "In 1889, Mr. Chief Justice, Congress passed a law that authorized negotiations for cessions of the Coeur d'Alene reservation by the tribe as such tribe shall consent to sell.",
  "It was ratified six months after the Statehood Act.",
  "The question is whether Congress had manifested its intent to defeat State title and under Alaska, the test is whether Congress intended to retain the executive reservation and knew that reservation contained submerged lands.",
  "The '89 Act does that by showing that Congress recognized the present reservation which was the reservation embraced within the 1873 executive order and the '86 Act which authorized the negotiations for the lands outside the present reservation.",
  "As the executive had defined it, Justice Scalia, and that's the key point here. The State has conceded that the executive order reservation is what it is and those boundaries that were defined in the geological survey had angles drawn in the lake itself, it's simply not tenable to suggest that when the lines are bent and a point is drawn in the lake and that the line crosses the lake that the lands underneath those navigable waters are not also included.",
  "In Alaska, however, and the reason why this is closer to Alaska than it is to Utah and to Montana is that the line actually was drawn on the submerged lands as it was in Alaska where the line was drawn out in the coastal waterway area. In Montana the reservation simply crossed a river, lines crossed the river and there was no survey in Montana that this Court discusses that would show acreage as being included. In fact, Montana is distinguishable there because the rights that were given by the treaty of 1868 only were residential rights.",
  "Because the map and the geological survey say so. If I could direct the court's attention to two maps, the first is on page 135 of the joint appendix and in -- that map was given to Congress in response to the Senate resolution asking specifically does the reservation include the navigable waters.",
  "Two reasons, first the executive enforced anti-liquor prohibitions on Indian country and as this court decided in Bates versus Clark in 1877, Indian country for purposes of that law was defined until tribal ownership was extinguished. The executive treated that land on the lake as tribal land for enforcing the Indian country prohibitions on liquor. Secondly --",
  "No, it does get you under the water because the enforcement was not occurring on that sliver of the lake that was not within the reservation. Moreover, the Senate said there are problems with trespass on the lake by whites not authorized to be within the reservation and the concept of trespass is traditionally thought of as ownership of the property.",
  "Yes, and the question, Mr. Chief Justice, is who owns the lake and in 1889 when General Simpson negotiated with the tribe they drew the line from one part directly across the lake to a different part directly across the lake. That map which is set out at page 202 of the joint appendix --",
  "The submerged lands were important to the tribe for a number of different reasons. Unlike the Crow tribe in Montana, this tribe depended on water resources and they recognized the value of submerged lands even before the 1873 executive order when they made an agreement with a man named Post to convey the river channels which can be nothing but submerged lands for the purpose of Post building a mill on that site. This tribe harvested water potatoes, it built fishing weirs that were affixed to the submerged lands of the lake and the associated waterways and the executive knew that. When they negotiated for the land, Chief Seltice insisted that the line be drawn in such a way that the tribe would understand what was theirs. And General Simpson in his response on page 183 of the joint appendix says quite clearly after this agreement when the line is redrawn you shall have the lower part of the lake. That could not be clearer that the executive understood that the submerged lands south of where the line was to be drawn were to be owned by the tribe. So the question then becomes this is in a sense an amalgam of Alaska and Utah lands because had this occurred before statehood this would have been a conveyance case and the question would have been what did Congress intend by the conveyance. And I would direct the court to the 1987 agreement which we have set forth in the --",
  "1887 agreement. On page 93 the language here is quite clear. It says, quote, it is agreed that the Coeur d'Alene reservation shall be held forever as Indian land and as homes for the Coeur d'Alene Indians. And then skipping down a few lines, and no part of said reservation shall ever be sold, occupied, open to white settlement or otherwise disposed of without the consent of the Indians residing on said reservation.",
  "That's correct, Justice Scalia, but --",
  "Justice Scalia, in the Alaska case the executive had set apart certain lands for a wildlife refuge which had not been finalized prior to Alaska statehood, but this court held that that executive reservation because Congress understood that it included submerged lands and was to meet the purposes behind the reservation defeated the State --",
  "To the contrary, Mr. Chief Justice. Here the 1873 executive order set apart the reservation.",
  "And in this case the disclaimer clause says until the United States extinguishes title to lands owned or held by Indians, the State of Idaho will disclaim all right and title to that land. The executive order reservation boundaries were well-known well before statehood and --",
  "It is proprietary in the sense of ownership, Justice Souter. The fact that the State may have some regulatory interest even over the southern third of the lake under even our theory because under the Mescalero Apache Indian case the State might still have a regulatory role, given a range of factors that would be involved in even if the tribe owns the southern third. But the important point is that we do know that it included submerged lands because the Post, the Frederick Post patent expressly included river channels which is submerged lands when they drew the Harrison cession in 1894. At first they started it, it meandered to the coast but because the town of Harrison wanted to build docks and wharfs, they redraw the line at a right angle in the middle of the lake so that the town of Harrison could build out that wharfage on to the submerged lands of the lake. So in this case the boundary lines are quite clear that the parties understood submerged lands were at issue and they drew the lines accordingly.",
  "No, the language that is the disclaimer clause that we have set out and I can direct the court to that language which we have put in the joint appendix, it's on page -- sorry, that language is on page 371 of the joint appendix and it provides as I have said, but I would point out that at this time Idaho had a number of Indian tribes that were resident there and so it would be unusual for a State and its constitution to single out a particular tribe when there are multiple tribes, when the purpose of this disclaimer clause was to emphasize that the State of Idaho would renounce and forever disclaim all right and title to the unappropriated public lands that were owned by the United States until such title had been extinguished by the United States.",
  "The State -- no, two things, Justice Stevens. Our theory depends upon the court recognizing the executive reservation through statehood which the '89 Act is clear --",
  "That would have raised an Alaska question and I think that that would have been enough in light of the executive having set forth the boundary. What the Statehood Act does for us is that it shows what Congress intended because Congress specifically adopted the Idaho constitution in the Statehood Act. So that is also an expression of congressional intent that Congress ratified and adopted the Idaho constitution and the Statehood Act which contained the disclaimer.",
  "It's in the Idaho admission bill.",
  "Well, it says section one, the State of Idaho is hereby declared to be a State and that the constitution which the people of Idaho have formed or themselves be in the same is hereby accepted, ratified, and confirmed. So Congress in section one of the Idaho Admission Act ratified the Idaho constitution which contained the disclaimer clause language.",
  "It's throughout the lake, although the principal portion of the polluted part is on the northern part of the lake. The southern part at least I'm reliably informed, and this is matter that's outside of the record, is not as polluted, although it is subject to pollution problems and issues. I would like to just make a couple of points in conclusion and that is the Idaho issue in terms of submerged lands is also implicated by the 1888 railroad statute which Congress passed and that passage which came after the Senate resolution asking about the navigable waters included a right of way that crossed across Lake Coeur d'Alene to a point on the lake itself and requires that the secretary provide compensation to the tribe for that easement and it further provided that no rights for the railroad shall accrue unless and until they obtained the consent of the tribe. So read together and this court's cases makes very clear two overarching propositions, that these Indian statutes should be read as a series and that doubts should be construed in favor of the tribe suggest that Congress did understand that the submerged lands were at stake, that the tribe had control over those submerged lands and that the United States would not take them without the consent of the tribe. If there are no further questions.",
  "Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Pesticides are economic poisons designed to kill living things. Sometimes they do not work as designed. For more than a century until the 1990's, courts routinely permitted farmers to bring claims against pesticide manufacturers for crop damage caused by pesticides. In enacting amendments to FIFRA in 1972, Congress did not intend to displace those preexisting State law remedies. The farmers here allege claims for defective design, defective manufacturing, fraud, breach of warranty, and failure to warn for a brand new product that severely damaged their peanut crops. I'd like to start with our narrowest theories for reversal and demonstrate for three reasons why those claims survive preemption. The defective design and manufacturing claims challenge the product's composition, not its label. The fraud, warranty, and negligence claims involve general legal duties, not pesticide-specific requirements, and the failure to warn and fraud claims are not different from or in addition to FIFRA requirements. Now, with respect to the first point, Dow concedes at pages 43 and 49 of its brief that defective design and manufacturing claims generally are not preempted. That concession warrants a remand here, as this case was decided before discovery, enable the farmers to develop their claims.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, the way the Restatement of Torts and Product Liability in sections 1 and 2 describe, there are basically three theories that products liability claims can proceed on: a defective design, defective manufacturing, and defective warnings. The restatement explains that they are distinct legal theories that go to different problems that the manufacturer has caused with respect to the product. A defective design claim asserts that the composition was inadequate and that a properly designed product could have been put on the market that would not cause the harm.",
  "Correct.",
  "Certainly, but here -­",
  "Well here, Your Honor, the motion for summary judgment that Dow filed was not based on the merits of the claims. It was based on them being preempted, displaced as a matter of Federal law. They also asserted a limitation of -- of remedy provision. But we never had discovery in this case. The District Court, after finding jurisdiction, considered Dow's motion for summary judgment on preemption and locked us out of the courthouse door before we ever had a chance to prove that a safer design for the product could have been made. And that's where we think the court's decision below was overbroad and should be reversed.",
  "That's absolutely correct.",
  "Yes. Restatement sections 1 and 2 address this, and what the restatement says is that if you can show that the product could have been reformulated to be properly designed, then the existence of a warning that might go to certain of its uses would not negate a defective design claim.

  "Under the restatement rule, which Texas has adopted in the Uniroyal case, which we've cited in our brief I think at page 47, that is true because the restatement explains that there are certain warnings that could be ignored or not observed or not understood properly and that if it can be proved that a properly designed product would be on the market, there are public policy reasons why that's what we want to encourage manufacturers to do. I mean, under --",

  "I don't think it's a question of warning in this sense, Justice Kennedy. If you take their theory, which is that a defective design claim always collapses to a failure to warn, they can put out a defectively designed product that admittedly causes harm, and all they have to do is change the label and say, if used in these particular circumstances, it may cause harm, because that would necessitate a change to the label -­",

  "Well, we have both actually.",
  "No. We have defective warning too, and -- and if I can address that as well. The statute here prohibits in section 136q(1) any false or misleading statement in the label as to any particular. Our position is that the 2000 label said, suitable for peanut-growing areas in all places where peanuts are grown. That was false. Under the statute, that is a misbranding, and that is actionable as -- both as a failure to warn, as a fraud claim, and as a breach of warranty. Now, the Medtronic majority made absolutely clear that that kind of claim is not preempted, and in fact all nine Justices agreed that when the State law claim is parallel to the Federal requirements, the existence of a State law remedy is not an additional requirement.",

  "Yes. And -- and because of the preliminary of this suit, Justice Kennedy, we certainly should have the opportunity to amend our complaint. There are counterclaims that this is done at the motion for declaratory judgment.",
  "Yes, it can and the -- the interesting aspect of this, Justice Breyer, is that of course EPA hasn't done that. EPA has made very clear it never tested for efficacy. It never even gave notice and comment so that --",
  "Yes.",
  "They have to do it pursuant to their powers under 136v(a) which is the regulation of sale or use or under 136v(c) which says that when a State designates a particular locality requirement and a special need, it can impose a label -- it can impose requirements that the manufacturer has to comply with. Now, the EPA importantly -- and this is in their regulations at 163.152 -- has specifically said that States have labeling authority. The States can impose labeling requirements. Now, there's no reason why -­",
  "No, Justice -- no, Justice O'Connor, except to the extent that if the State can affirmatively do it through a positive regulation, their theory has to be wrong that the -- that any incidental effect that induces a change to label is preempted. That theory has to be wrong, and that's what the Fifth Circuit relied on.",
  "Yes, but I want to address -­",
  "As the -­",
  "A warranty claim, Justice O'Connor, as this Court made clear in the Cipollone case, is not a requirement under State law because it's a voluntary contractual arrangement between the parties. The Court I think has made clear that what has to be ascertained here is does the State cause of action or the State law create a requirement. That's not true in the warranty case because FIFRA doesn't speak to requirements in -- as to warranties. It speaks to requirements in other ways. So what Dow did here with its warranty was completely voluntary, and the fact that it breached that warranty by putting on the market a product that was not suitable for the use in all areas where peanuts are grown is a breach of a warranty that it voluntarily undertook. Breach of that is not a requirement imposed under State law. And that has been, I think, verified by seven Justices of this Court in the -- in the Cipollone case. Now, if I could speak to the fraud claim, it is important to understand that in both Cipollone and in a footnote in Medtronic, the Court made clear that where there are general legal duties that are not observed by the manufacturer that don't go to the specific product itself, those claims are not preempted. Here our assertion is that Dow put on the market a -- a product that was mislabeled and that they went out and told people fraudulently was suitable for their uses. We acted in reliance on that and we suffered damages. Those are general legal duties, not pesticide-specific ones. And the existence of the preemption clause of 136v(b) does not displace us from the opportunity to try to prove to a court that fraud was committed here. Now, if I could briefly address two points. One is that the inducement to change theory should be rejected. That was the basis on which the Fifth Circuit decided this case and it is an overly broad theory for several reasons. First, it's not supported by the text of 136v(b) which says requirements for labeling. It doesn't say requirements that induce a change to the label. And that's how many of the courts have gone off track since the Cipollone decision was announced by this Court. They have read FIFRA as saying just because the word requirements is 136v(b), thereby any State law claim that imposes a requirement that might induce a manufacturer to change the label is thereby preempted. We think that's overly broad because it confers way too much discretion on manufacturers to decide what to put on labels, and they can claim immunity for any overly broad claim of efficacy so long as when they are sued, they can say we're induced to change the label. Because EPA does not evaluate the specific contents with respect to efficacy or the claims that are made on -- on a label, if a manufacturer makes an overly ambitious statement as to efficacy, all the manufacturer has to do under the inducement to change theory is go to court and say we would have to change the label and thereby 136v(b) preempts it. Now, I'd also like to stress that the other side's theory creates a huge regulatory gap. As your question, Justice O'Connor, noted, the EPA does not evaluate efficacy on the front end. And in fact, the history behind these provisions is that EPA understood from the very beginning that common law claims would serve an important incidental regulatory effect. If we could review the history for a moment. Prior to the 1972 changes to FIFRA, for decades farmers had brought claims against manufacturers for design defect, for failure to warn, for the kinds of common law claims that we have asserted in this case. It was so well established by 1972 that there was a huge section in the American Law Reports that annotated all the cases and explained what the common law duties of pesticide manufacturers were. Yet, notwithstanding that, when Congress enacted the 1972 act, despite thousands of pages of hearings, committee reports, legislative debates, there is not one mention of any effort to displace those preexisting common law claims. And when EPA, in discharging its responsibilities under the 1972 act, got overwhelmed by the requirement that it re-register products that were already out on the market, pursuant to the 1972 act's standards, it very promptly went to Congress and said, you should waive efficacy requirements because we simply can't do this. Congress responded, but importantly in the administrations on both sides, EPA has always understood except until just a couple of years ago when the Solicitor General changed the position of the Government, that these kinds of incidental common law suits would have an important regulatory effect. If we could just take the case of DDT. For 30 years, manufacturers were sued for DDT and awarded damages until it became clear that the groundswell over the course of decades that DDT needed to be banned, and it was only at the back end that the expert agency regulators determined that in fact the product needed to be banned, but that was only after a very long history in which common law suits had provided remedies to farmers and others who were harmed by that product. Now, in 1982, the Reagan administration's EPA expanded the efficacy waiver and it included far greater products than had been done in the Carter administration in 1979. And in the Federal Register notice announcing that it was intending to expand that efficacy waiver, the EPA in 1982 said the reason why we think this can be done is because suits can be brought against manufacturers who put on the market ineffective products. We cited that on page 31 of our brief.",
  "Well, our broadest theory, Justice Kennedy, is that the word requirements in 136v(b) doesn't include common law claims at all.",
  "If you disagree with that, then they would have to be the same, and that's why our point about the existence of the parallel requirements is the same. I want to address the point of the discordance between what State juries can decide and what State regulators can decide because Dow and the Government have featured that in their case. The Government in the Medtronic case at page 27 of its amicus brief there said there was no problem to be had with juries rendering supposedly inconsistent decisions so long as they were following one Federal standard. The Federal standard here is clear: falsity. Tell the truth. That's what manufacturers are obliged to do under the statute and under the regulations.",
  "First, the juries -- unlike a -­ a declaratory judgment or an injunctive type remedy, Justice Breyer, a jury for a common law damages claim is not saying what affirmatively should be on the labels.",
  "Sure.",
  "Sure. The answer is that -­ that Congress was prepared to accept a certain level of disuniformity when it enacted 136v because it made very clear in sandwiching the preemption provision of 136b -­ surround -- by (a) and (c) that it was prepared to allow States to depart in significant respects from what was nationally uniform. And the way it did so was to say States can regulate sale or use and they can also impose extra requirements for special locations. Now, what Dow did here I think illustrates the way the system is supposed to work, which is that when a problem was identified with their product in the States of Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, within 7 months it petitioned the EPA to append to its national uniform label a supplemental label. And that supplemental label says it is for distribution in those three States only and it provided 10 important changes to the label that it otherwise had as a nationally uniform label. That's how the system is supposed to work. If the incidental regulatory effect of jury verdicts or common law claims induces or causes some kind of change to the label, that can be done without an adverse effect to national uniformity through the supplemental labeling process. And what Dow did here was it has its label and then it attaches the supplemental label that addresses the particular conditions that exist in the State. And the EPA has recognized that as a perfectly appropriate and valid way to address the geographic, environmental, and climatic conditions that exist in the different regions of the country that engage in agriculture. There's nothing that is uncertain about that if you accept the premise of the Government's argument in Medtronic, which is that juries can be properly instructed, if it came to that, so that they could follow the appropriate Federal standard. Now, I would like to turn -- sorry. Did you -­ no, go ahead. I would like to turn briefly to the -- the requirements aspect of the case because we do think that, under our broadest theory, this is a different situation than Medtronic and Cipollone, and because of the important statutory indications that are in the provision 136v. Unlike in Medtronic, there is an explicit provision that is a non-preempted provision, and that is different from Medtronic. Where in Medtronic there was a provision that allowed the FDA to impose its own decisions as to requirements and whether or not the States should be displaced, here Congress made the determination in 136v(a) and in (c) that those kinds of requirements can be imposed. They're in addition to what the Federal standard is. That means that you have to look at requirements in a somewhat different way because the States have this authority that they did not have under the Medical Device Amendments. There's a textual indicator under (b) also which refers to (a) in the sense that (b) says such State that shall issue these requirements. Such -- the meaning of it in Webster's means what has been already described -- is in (a), and in (a) the States are authorized to promulgate regulations. So we think that there is a textual basis for distinguishing the word requirements that this Court -- five Justices in this Court in Medtronic said would encompass common law claims. If there are no further questions at this time, I'd like to reserve the balance -­",
  "Well, I don't think that EPA could write a rule requiring damages to be done. It doesn't have the statutory authority -­",
  "Well, there's no indication here that EPA can do that kind of thing. In FIFRA, it certainly doesn't have that kind of provision. I mean, certainly there are different ways that the statute could have been written. That isn't the choice that Congress made. Thank you.",
  "I just have two points to make. With respect to the summary judgment posture of the case, the way this unfolded was that on one day the District Court decided the motion for jurisdiction, that it had jurisdiction. On the very next day, Dow rushed into court with its motion for summary judgment. And what Mr. Waxman cites as the Celotex invocation merely says that on -- on this point it is neither unfair nor premature to require defendants to produce evidence in support of their claims now as the Celotex trilogy requires. I'm reading from their motion for summary judgment. That was filed before the counterclaims. The only thing that they knew about was the deceptive trade practices notice letter that the farmers had filed pursuant to State law. So they didn't know what our claims were, and they were requiring or saying that the District Court could throw us out of court without giving us any opportunity to file counterclaims, much less try to develop evidence that would prove them. Now, with respect to the disuniformity point, when Congress amended the statute in 1988 to add the word uniformity, it said in that public law that it was a technical amendment. We don't know why Congress put the word uniformity in. The legislative history is barren. It just says this is a technical amendment. It didn't change the substantive provisions that empowered States to impose regulations that would have the effect of disuniformity. Now, at the end of the day, we've got claims that have been brought historically since the late 19th century. Until EPA had a sudden change of heart, there were decades in which juries made these decisions with respect to these kinds of products, and those preemption decisions really didn't take hold until after this Court announced Cipollone in 1992. And it was only at that point that the courts began to have preemption, but for the previous 2 decades, juries routinely decided these kinds of cases. The sky did not fall. EPA didn't come in and say there's labeling disuniformity as a result of this. There simply were no problems. But what did happen was that the farmers who used products were able to get compensation when pesticides damaged their crops. Thank you.",

  "Yes. It was not the fullest extent of the commerce power.

The fact - -",
  "No, no, Justice Scalia.",

  "Well, it's been articulated in several different contexts. In the Brown v. Duchesne case, the Court 150 years ago articulated in a patent case where the Court said that a patented device on the ship, which was the French ship in Boston Harbor infringing an American patent-holder, would not apply U.S. patent law. And the Court said, because we can't conceive that Congress would have imagined this general language to encroach on the sovereignty of a foreign ship. Now, the other side has exactly two sentences to say about that case, but that is the case that is directly on point because that case says that when you are dealing with American laws that are generally written, you would not ordinarily apply them to a foreign ship unless Congress said so specifically.",

  "And -- and you would have - - under their theory, you would have the Consumer Products Safety Act, the Food and Drug Act, OSHA, all sorts of other statutes of general application that are now going to be imposed on foreign vessels simply because they do a lot of business in the United States. The problem here, as a matter of congressional intent, is we don't know what Congress thought about this, and because Congress - -",

  "It doesn't -- Justice Kennedy, the problem with that theory is it just doesn't comport with the language of -- of the statute. Congress didn't think in terms of -- as it did in the Oil Pollution Act, it said, if there's a conflict with international law, work it out. Get the Coast Guard with the foreign nations and work out the conflict. It didn't put anything like that in this statute, which is a further indication that if Congress wants to extend this kind of disability protection, it can do that, but it ought to do so willingly. And the Government has had 13 years to come up with rules that would govern cruise ships, and the best they've done, a few days before the top-side briefs in this case were filed, is to issue proposed draft guidelines for ferries, not cruise ships. Most of the regulations that they are pointing to wouldn't have an application to a large passenger cruise ship. If Congress wants to change this, it certainly has the power, but this Court need not open up a Pandora's box of domestic legislation to apply to foreign ships where Congress has not expressed the intent to do that.",
  "Yes. I don't perceive a limiting principle to the other side's position. In fact, there's an amicus brief written where there's only one or two stops in the United States a year, and under their view, that ship would be governed by the ADA as well. If -- if Congress wants to enact these limits, it's certainly free to do so, but this is a highly complex area and ships are different from land-based accommodations because you have to be able to evacuate people within 30 minutes.

  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is a routine diversity case that went seriously awry in the court of appeals. The original defendants in -- named in the complaint, Petitioners State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which I'll refer to as SWIB, and Lincoln Property Company, are completely proper and diverse parties. SWIB owned the apartment complex, and Lincoln managed it through agents. The Fourth Circuit, nonetheless, embarked on a search for affiliates of Lincoln that it thought would be more appropriate party defendants, what the court deemed, quote, \"real parties in interest.\" The Fourth Circuit's holdings are fundamentally flawed, in two respects. First, because the named defendants are proper parties, the court erred in holding that Lincoln had not carried its burden of proof by failing to establish that some non-named putative defendants might possibly destroy complete diversity, and that the remedy for such a possibility was dismissal of the action from Federal court. Second, the court erroneously engrafted a, quote, \"very close nexus\" requirement onto the test for require -- for determining the citizenship of a limited partnership. Now, with respect to the first issue, a number of black-letter legal principles govern a court's consideration of non-named parties. Let's start with the statutory text. The diversity statute, at section 1332(a), talks about civil actions, and a \"civil action\" is defined as the naming of a plaintiff and a defendant. A civil action does not encompass those that are not named in the lawsuit. That language is tracked in the removal statute, section 1441(a), which also speaks of civil actions, and in -- mirrored in 1441(b), which says that a defendant may remove, where it is properly joined and served.",
  "It is, Justice Souter, but what -- my argument is that that language, properly joined and served, simply tracks the civil-action requirement under the original diversity statute, as well as the removal provision of 1441(a). But what the court --",
  "What the court of appeals did, and where we think it got off track, was it took the -- to -- the phrase \"parties in interest,\" and it -- and it took cases from this Court that have used the phrase \"real parties in interest\" to determine what are proper party plaintiffs, and it used that concept on the defendant's side of the ledger. And none of the cases from this Court talk about \"real parties in interest\" as being defendants. The explanation given by the court for doing it on the plaintiff's side is to ensure that a defendant is not going to be subjected to multiple suits. But there are many purposes --",
  "Our position, Your Honor, is that the phrase \"parties in interest\" -- we were seeking to find out where the court could have applied that phraseology on the defendant's side. And the only place that we could find, in the statutes or the rules, was in 1441(b) and the explanation for removal, that we were not a \"proper party in interest.\" And that's why we focused on that.",
  "There are, Justice Ginsburg. And the analysis goes to whether or not ­ - how far along in the proceeding the litigation has occurred before the plaintiff makes that choice. Of course, a plaintiff can voluntarily drop defendants, without any consequences, and the courts have fairly uniformly held that it -- that it is no jurisdictional bar for a plaintiff to drop a non- diverse defendant in order to ensure that diversity would be present. Had this complaint been brought in Federal court, there is no doubt that the court would have had original jurisdiction, because, on the face of the complaint, the two named defendants were completely diverse.",
  "And that position is incorrect, both as a factual matter and as a legal matter. As a factual matter, Lincoln is a completely proper party. Its name is on the lease. It was the employer of Mr. Roche, who was one of the plaintiffs in the suit. It issued the mold policies that are at issue in the case. All of its advertising is alleged to have been fraudulent in the original complaint. And it was the director and manager of the agents whose acts were alleged to have been negligent here. There's --",
  "-- no question --",
  "Well, Mr. Chaney's testimony has to be viewed in contact -- in context, Justice Ginsburg. He was not called as a 30(b)(6) witness as a corporate -- for a corporate form and structure. The testimony that was being elicited was to see whether Lincoln had other entities and ownership of properties in Virginia so that they could attempt to prove that there was a problem that the parent company, Lincoln Property Company, knew about. There was a high degree of imprecision in the deposition questions, and it's fairly clear, I think, that the lawyer and the witness did not understand what each other were talking about. Yet in the discovery process, not a single question was presented that would get at the organizational structure of Lincoln. There was not any attempt to get behind the management documents between SWIB and Lincoln Property. It was one very small snippet of a deposition which has been taken out of context and, we would submit, blown out of proportion by the Respondents in their submissions in this case.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, as the Real Estate Roundtable brief demonstrates, and is unrebutted, the real-estate industry operates through many very complicated structures for perfectly legitimate finance and tax-related reasons. And Mr. Franzen is a partner in some deals, but the testimony that was provided in a declaration -- and it is appended to our reply brief -- demonstrates that Mr. Franzen was not a partner in any deal that had anything to do with the Westfield Village Apartments. But what the court of appeals did was, it erected a burden of proof that said that the defendant has to prove a negative, that there is not some affiliate corporation out there that is a citizen of the Commonwealth that would be existing to destroy diversity. And that type of burden, to prove a negative, has never been authorized in this Court's cases. Rather, what this Court's cases have held is that, as the masters of their complaint, plaintiffs have an opportunity to plead whichever defendants they want to try to prove their allegations against. If they want to try to prove Federal claims, this Court has held that that kind of case can be removed. If it wants to plead around Federal claims, this Court's cases have said that that would be respected, as well.",
  "Well, we don't think, Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, that the \"real party in interest\" analysis even applies on the defendant's side, but it is -- it would not apply to this extent. It's not for the courts, once they have a proper defendant, to be searching outside the record for possible jurisdictional spoilers once jurisdiction has been established. And this court's cases --",
  "If they do -- if there is no proper defendant, then I think --",
  "That's correct. It --",
  "That's correct. It would be a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, where there is no defendant who would be liable to the plaintiff. But what the court of appeals did here was, it imposed an obligation on the defendants that, in effect, confuses the obligations that are in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19, which looks at whether there are necessary or indispensable parties. And what the court did was, in effect, to take an unnamed affiliated entity to Lincoln and treat it as the --",
  "-- functional equivalent of an --",
  "No. In fact, in their answer, Justice Stevens, they admitted that they were the manager of the apartment, that they had run it through their agents. They acknowledged that it was their policies that were in effect. There wouldn't have been a basis that would have survived rule 11 that would have given Lincoln Property Company a basis on which not to defend the lawsuit. And so, to that extent, we think it's quite clear that they are a proper party defendant. We've always taken the position that if we are found liable, we would pay a judgment. The issue is that we don't think we're liable, because we think that the allegations in the complaint are completely baseless. And that's what the district court found when it held, on summary judgment, that there was not a dispute of fact as to the core allegations of the complaint. Returning to the point I was trying to make about rule 19, there is a mechanism for the courts to consider whether there are indispensable parties. And what the court did here was to take a rule 19 kind of inquiry -- Is a non-named defendant really an indispensable party, such that dismissal of the action is warranted? -- and to engraft that onto a jurisdictional inquiry. But the reason why we have the Rules of Civil Procedure is, of course, to follow them. And what the Fourth Circuit did here was, it took that kind of analysis, but it didn't follow the standards that the courts have set out for applying rule 19 properly.",
  "And, Justice Ginsburg, they never sought to name or join that other possible defendant. They never brought a joinder motion. They never even conducted discovery as to whether or not there was another possible defendant that might be affiliated. And their theory of liability made it unnecessary, because their theory of liability was that Lincoln Property Company, the parent, is responsible for all the acts of its agents. And had they really wanted to be in Federal court, they could have found plenty of Virginia citizens that they could have sued. They could have sued the plumber, they could have sued the installer of a -- heating and air-conditioning equipment, they could have sued the general contractors. There are a lot of people they could have sued if they were that intent on staying in Federal court. But, instead, they made a tactical choice to sue the deepest pockets. And the deepest pockets happened to be out-of-State citizens that have a right under the statutes to remove the case.",
  "And we readily satisfied that, both on the face of the complaint, which identified Lincoln Property Company as a Texas corporation, and in the remand notice, which identified its principal place of business as Texas. Even the court of appeals had no problem calling it a \"Texas parent,\" because the corporation documents, which are part of the record, amply demonstrated that Lincoln Property Company is, in fact, a Texas corporation and satisfies those requisites under the diversity jurisdiction provision. The -- instead, what the Fourth Circuit has done is to erect a standardless forum that will increase litigation over jurisdiction by inviting courts to make inquiry about parties and entities that are not named in the lawsuit, solely for the purpose of determining whether or not there are jurisdictional spoilers.",
  "Well, what the ninth circuit, in a -- in an opinion by then-Judge Kennedy that we have cited, called Simpson -- said you respect the plaintiff's allegations. If the plaintiff wants to sue the parent, and the parent is an out-of-State corporation, the plaintiff is the master of the complaint. And, in the Simpson case, the Ninth Circuit held that it was completely proper to remain in Federal court, even though it was obvious to all that there was a subsidiary that was an in-State subsidiary that, if it had been sued, would be non-diverse. So, we think that's the proper answer, Mr. Chief Justice. Now, if I could turn to the second issue that we have prevented -- presented, that concerns how one would treat EQR, which is the management agent of Lincoln Property Company. We read the Fourth Circuit's opinion as engrafting onto this Court's test in the Carden case an additional requirement that, in addition to the citizens of --",
  "If you agree with us on question one, Justice Ginsburg, reversal is the appropriate disposition, and the Court need not reach question two. We would submit, however, that, because the error is so egregious and leads to the difficulties that have been outlined by the Real Estate Roundtable for nationwide business entities, that the Court certainly ought to say that this was error, as well, or at least to vacate that part of the judgment, as well. And the reason is, in the Carden case, what the Court held was that the --",
  "No, but you --",
  "-- expressed disapproval with this very-close-nexus standard by which the Fourth Circuit attempted to engraft onto the normal citizenship rules for a limited partnership the notion that its citizenship could be deemed, if its activities had a very close nexus with the State -- and I'm referring now to the passage, Justice Ginsburg, that's at pages 16(a) to 17(a) of the petition appendix. There are four page -- four sentences on those two pages that capture the error of the Fourth Circuit. And, just below the bottom, it says -- it says, \"The real party in interest owns land and operates a substantial part of its business in Virginia, thus establishing a very close nexus with the Commonwealth.\"",
  "Well, all of the evidence, Justice Ginsburg, in the record was that EQR was a Delaware limited partnership, where it was registered, composed of a Texas corporation as its general partner, and a limited partner that had two partners that were, themselves, Texas corporations. So, the evidence in the record established that EQR, which was the entity the Fourth Circuit was alluding to here, was, in fact, a Texas citizen, and its attempt to confuse the record by suggesting that there was a way to look at the citizenship of that entity through its, quote, \"very close nexus with the State,\" we submit, is also in error.",
  "That's correct.",
  "That's correct, Justice Stevens, and that's where we think that the Fourth Circuit went off. I'd just like to make one more point before saving the remainder of my time for rebuttal, and that is that if the Fourth Circuit was correct, SWIB is a critical party here, which the respondents never deny. It is the owner of the apartment building. It is a completely proper defendant for the acts of negligence in -- and other wrongdoings that they allege. But they never mention that party in their brief. So, if the Fourth Circuit is correct that Lincoln, the parent, really is nominal under this Court's decisions, its citizenship should be completely disregarded. That was the holding of this Court in Walden versus Skinner in 1879. On the other hand, if a Lincoln affiliate at that stage in the litigation is a proper defendant, but non- diverse, the Fourth Circuit should have dismissed it, under Horn versus Lockhart, which was decided in 1873. If the Court has no further questions, thank you.",
  "I would waive, but for the clarification of two points in the record. Number one, we take umbrage at being accused of a lack of candor in this Court. Paragraph 22 of their complaint says, and I'll quote, \"All the defendants, acting through Lincoln and/or their obligations as owners of the property through the lease and acting by and through their agents, were responsible for one or more acts of common law and/or statutory negligent conduct with respect to Roche's apartment, including, but not limited to,\" a long laundry list. When the parent is sued for the acts of its agents, and the parent comes forward and says, \"We will accept the responsibility for our agents,\" there's no cause to be accused of a lack of candor simply because there's no effort later to identify who those agents are.",
  "And Lincoln had control. It was acting through agents. That's undisputed. But the lease says Lincoln Property Company is the party, as agent, for the owner, SWIB. Lincoln Property Company set the policies for the mold. Lincoln Property Company hired Mr. Roche as an employee. Lincoln Property Company directed the actions of all of the people involved in this. And so, there's not -- there's not any basis on which Lincoln Property could come -- Company could say, \"We are not responsible.\" And when this was --",
  "-- put to us --",
  "There would be no authority from this Court to so hold. And there -- the interrogatory that he points to, interrogatory number 3, reads as follows, \"Identify every person, other than your attorneys, who is aware of the facts and circumstances surrounding Mr. Roche's lease at Westfield Village Apartments and repeat in detail the substance of such person's knowledge.\" Now, from that interrogatory, we are supposed to infer that there are -- a question about the citizenship of the affiliated entities through which Lincoln is operating. We put forward all of the names of the people that we could identify who had some knowledge about this. But I would submit to you that a response, as he is suggesting here in this Court, is not a reasonable one. Finally, with respect to Mr. Franzen, the fact that his title may say \"partner\" surely cannot transform the corporation documents that say that Lincoln Property Company is a corporation in the State of Texas. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our position is that SLUSA does not preempt class actions asserting holder claims. Congress incorporated this Court's interpretation of \"in connection with\" from Blue Chip Stamps when it enacted SLUSA. SLUSA rechanneled State suits to Federal court. It was not designed to eliminate State remedies that could not be pursued as Federal 10(b)(5) claims. That interpretation is the better reading of the text, the context, and the history of SLUSA's handling of private securities actions. If I could start with the text - -",
  "No, because this Court, in the Blue Chip Stamps case, said that it did not. In footnote 5, Justice Rehnquist - -",
  "In enforcement - -",

  "-- jurisdiction.",
  "They do, for enforcement purposes; they do not, for private civil-action purposes.",
  "No. What I want you to do is to understand what Congress intended. And what Congress intended, in SLUSA, I think is quite clear if you start at the beginning of the statute and you just start reading your way through it, because what Congress did in SLUSA was attempt to stop a flight of cases that had been brought in Federal court heretofore, but were migrating to State court, Congress perceived, as a result of the enactment of the PSLRA. Section 2 of SLUSA -- and it is very important, Your Honors, that you look carefully at section 2 of SLUSA, because it has five congressional findings. They are not adequately briefed, or even discussed, by the Second Circuit, but one of them says that the PSLRA sought to prevent abuses. The second one says, since an enactment of that, Congress perceives that a number of securities class-action lawsuits have shifted from Federal to State courts. The third one says, that shift has prevented the act from achieving its objectives. The next one says, State securities regulation is of continuing importance. And the then, the fifth one says, in order to prevent certain State private securities class actions alleging fraud from being used to frustrate the objectives of the PSLRA, it is appropriate to enact these national standards.",
  "The point, though, Justice Scalia, is that what Congress, in the PSLRA, was doing was attempting to ratchet up the pleading requirements for Federal-law claims.",
  "Absolutely - -",
  "-- not.",
  "That's not correct, Justice Scalia. And it's important to emphasize this. What the Court addressed in the Blue Chip Stamps case was a very different kind of case. It involved nonpurchasers. And the Court reasoned that it would be speculative for somebody out there to say, \"Well, I would have purchased the security, had I known.\" A holder claim, as recognized for a century in various State courts, involves a claim by somebody who holds a security and is induced by fraud not to sell that security. The restatement set of torts, section 525, recognizes that the fraud by forebearance of -- to cause you not to take an action is just as much a fraud as one that - -",
  "-- induces you.",
  "In most circumstance, that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice. But that, I don't think is material. The level of damages that a holder sustains should not determine what the elements of the liability are. And what is striking about the Government and Merrill Lynch's position here is that intentional fraud is going to be given a pass because of those persons who are uniquely harmed, because, for 20 years - -",
  "That's the same kind of claim that in -- to get back to Justice Scalia's question - - arises in the purchaser/seller context. The only difference is that the measure of damages is computed by when you purchase or sell, as opposed to when you bought it, before the fraud occurred.

  "True. But, in the '90s, you had a unique form of fraud that was being perpetrated on Wall Street that did affect holders in a unique way. And we've highlighted market timing in our briefs. In that circumstance, it would be futile for 49 holders to get together and assert that they had been harmed by market timing, because the aggregate of their harm is so small that you really have to look at it in a large context. John Vogel, the head of Vanguard for many years, and one of most respected mutual-fund advisors, says that there are as many as $5 billion lost by people who buy and hold, as we've been taught to do by Wall Street, but whose aggregate losses accrete every year by virtue of market timing. That is a unique harm caused to holders, which, under their theory, would not be cognizable, because it would be preempted, and it would be impossible, as a practical matter, for someone to get together with 48 of his or her fellow victims and try to bring a claim to redress that.

Certainly, just as \"breach of fiduciary duty\" and \"breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing\" are State-law claims, negligence is a State-law claim, all of those give rise to variations, State by State.

And if you could not bring a holder claim under Federal law, because of Blue Chip Stamps, you were forced into State court. Okay? So, when Congress is debating the evasion of the PSLRA, it is only talking about Federal-law claims.

  "But what -- what this Court did say, in Blue Chip Stamps, was that, when the Birnbaum decision -- and it was an interpretation of \"in connection with purchase or sale\" by what one Justice on this Court described as the \"Mother Court of the Court of Appeals\" -- it was Chief Judge Swan, Judge Augustus Hand, and Judge Learned Hand -- and they construed the words \"in connection with purchase or sale\" to mean the plaintiff's purchase - -",

  "Well, I think it -- it did adopt the rule, though, as a basis of the wording. And if you look at page 733 of the Court's opinion, it was adopting the rationale, in the sense that it saw Birnbaum as a construction of the language, and it adopted that. And then in note 5, when Justice Rehnquist's opinion says, \"It would be odd to read 'in connection with purchase or sale' to give a,\" quote, \"'cause of action to everybody in the world,'\" I think it's clear that that was suggesting that State law could recognize something that this Court said was not recognized under Federal law.",

  "So, the SEC - -",
  "This is an act, Justice Scalia, where the SEC's enforcement authority isn't affected one jot. And so, I think it would be a strange application of Chevron, or even Skidmore, deference to say that the SEC gets some special weight because it's construing words in an enactment - -",
  "-- that's addressed to private - -",

  "Yes. And it took the position there that \"in connection with\" did have a broad construction. And that position was rejected.",

  "Well, there are class actions that concern breaches of fiduciary duty, negligence. And the question of whether or not they are \"in connection with purchase or sale\" is going to have a profound impact on whether or not those claims are also preempted. I can't spell out for you what the necessary consequences are, but there are a lot of State-law claims brought under Blue Sky laws and other State remedies that traditionally have been observed and brought, even as State claims, but, under a -- you know, the all-encompassing parameter of \"in connection with purchase or sale\" advanced on the other side, a decision that would favor that could have unknown preemptive consequences, which I would submit would be contrary to the normal way you would put Congress to the test of determining, \"Did it intend to preempt those claims?\" before adopting a broad interpretation that would do so. And if I could point out - -",
  "-- one of the strange things about this case and the SEC's position is that district courts are going to be put in the rather unusual position of paying a rather high cost, because if they are confronted with a removal of a case brought under State law, where the defendant asserts that it is preempted under SLUSA, and the SEC hasn't taken any action at all, and has expressed no interest in this particular area, the district court, to determine preemption, has to intuit whether or not this is within the SEC's enforcement authority. So, you have -- ordinarily, you would have private plaintiffs suing for wrongdoing on the same side of the case as the SEC, as the public enforcer. But, here, you have them at loggerheads. And the only way that the district court can properly figure that out, whether or not the private victim can get a private remedy, is to cut back on the SEC's enforcement authority, will -- if you will -- would exact an awfully high cost. I would submit that that kind of an anomaly is a rather unusual one, particularly where the SEC isn't a party in the case, and it is not being invited to submit a brief. And yet, district courts, in order to determine the preemption question here, are going to have to rule against the SEC in order to give a private remedy -- to recognize a private remedy under State law, or to cut back on a remedy under State law by holding that it is within the SEC's enforcement jurisdiction. Ultimately, what Merrill Lynch here is asserting is an immunity for a fraud that uniquely affects a certain class of holders who do not have a remedy under Federal law. And I would submit that, where any party is seeking to get an immunity from an intentional fraud, the party bears a heavy presumption that that is, in fact, what Congress intended. And I would submit to you that, both with the language of the statute, the findings that Congress made in the legislative history, Congress did not express an intent to eliminate holder class actions of greater than 49 persons.",
  "But it's preemption to rechannel. And that's the important point, Justice Scalia. The point was not to allow State-law claims under State-court systems, but to rechannel those actions into Federal court. And if there are a category of victims of frauds who have no Federal remedy, it doesn't make sense to infer that Congress, without saying so, left those people without any remedy whatsoever.",
  "Well, it depends on how the courts would construe the SLUSA cases as affecting the \"in connection with purchase or sale\" in the SEC enforcement authority. If you were to accept the premise that the Court's Zandford and O'Hagan decisions are binding on the SLUSA preemption language, anytime a court is construing - - May I finish, Mr. Chief Justice?",
  "Anytime a court is construing that language, in the SLUSA context, it would necessarily have a collateral impact on the SEC's enforcement authority in 10(b).",
  "It could certainly relitigate it. But the point of the persuasive authority of a construction of \"in connection with purchase or sale,\" I think, would have effects that are inappropriate.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns use of alleged fraud in the underpayment of taxes as the predicate for a treble damages civil RICO action. Respondent Ideal Steel concedes that it was not defrauded, but it, nonetheless, claims lost profits when National failed to pay State sales taxes and thereby offered a lower overall price to consumers. Our position is that Ideal's injury is too indirect as a matter of law under RICO. In reinstating Ideal's RICO claims against errors. First, it substituted a direct targeting test that credited the plaintiff's allegations of intent causation in the Holmes case. And second, the Second Circuit permitted Ideal to satisfy the reliance requirement by invoking the State of New York's reliance on the truth of National's allegedly false tax returns. Both errors transformed civil RICO into a litigation weapon of great destructive force for defendants who will be forced to defend, beyond the pleading stages, damages claims of the most attenuated and indirect character. With respect to our first argument, proximate cause, the court below erred by not applying this Court's test in Holmes and also by failing to take into account the fact that fraud is a statutory violation that -- for which the plaintiff needs to be within the zone of interest. Quite simply, because Ideal was not the defrauded party, it is not within the zone of interest protected by the fraud statute. With respect to the Holmes factors, for three reasons the -- Ideal Steel is unable to plead proximate cause. First, in Holmes, this Court made clear that difficult to prove in terms of ascertaining what the level of damages is. That is particularly true in this causation that allege -- that Ideal alleges as a factual matter.",
  "I don't agree, Justice Souter, and here's why. In Holmes, the customers were decision -- in -- in the Court's decision. They stood in a direct line from the harm that was caused when the brokerage to go down. It was completely foreseeable that customers that owned the shares in those firms would also suffer direct harm.",
  "That -- that's not so. There is, and New York is in between them in this respect. If -- Ideal is asserting that because the taxes had not been charged and then paid to the State of New York, that National gained a competitive advantage. But I think the Court has been clear that the competitive harms -- and this was true in the Associated General Contracting case in which the Court in Holmes relied directly -- is not going to be sufficient when there are multiple steps in the chain. Here, as a factual matter, Justice Souter, which there was not a tax paid, assert that that person was wrongfully not charged a tax. Under New York law, certificate, it's not appropriate for the vendor in this case to charge the sales tax. And then they have to be able to show that they would have gotten the sale --",
  "Because this Court rejected a similar theory in section 4 of the Clayton Act context where it held that a specific intent to injure is not sufficient as a pleading matter. The Court in that case held that where an association had a -- an -- a specific intent to harm the unions, that that was not sufficient for invoking section 4 of the Clayton Act. The same analysis applies here because what Ideal is attempting to do is to use artful pleading as through their simple assertions that there are no, in fact, other competitors within a three-State area and They're attempting to evade the normal requirements for proximate cause that look to whether or not the direct injury is suffered by the plaintiff.",
  "Well, as the briefs indicate -- and we're somewhat outside the record. As the case comes to this Court, it's on the pleadings. But the footnotes in the brief give a little bit of a flavor of what has happened since then, and there are audit proceedings that the State of New York has commenced. It has not commenced any kind of civil or criminal proceeding against National, nor has it brought a RICO action against National. But there are discussions with the State at the level of the auditors as to whether or not any back tax is owed and, if so, in what amount.",
  "That's correct, Justice there are in excess of 500,000 corporate income tax statements that are issued by the IRS for underpayment each year and in excess of 6 million unemployment underpayment notices sent out. And under Ideal's theory, each of those would be a predicate act for a RICO case, asserting treble damages where one competitor could use the in terrorem effect of a RICO claim simply because of an underpayment of tax notice.",
  "We have to assume that for purposes of this pleading except insofar as it acknowledges whether or not a legal requirement is satisfied, and I think that the cases of this Court and certainly the commentators have been clear the Court does not need to assume a fact for purposes of a legal conclusion. As the -- as the footnotes indicate, that has not been borne out by discovery, and there are, in fact, multiple competitors.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, the way we get to the proximate cause requirement through Holmes is through 1964(c)'s use of by reason of a violation of the same whether it's a 62(a) violation or a 62(c) violation. And in fact, Ideal has not advanced really in order to get a deeper pocket, National, which they would not be able to get under 1962(c). Corporations are not persons.",
  "They -- that's not their allegation, though, in this sense. The theory that your hypothesis is postulating is a money laundering predicate act, but they don't assert money laundering as the predicate act. They assert fraud. And it's exactly the same conduct, the alleged underpayment of taxes that is fraudulently sent to the State of New York, and through that, an indirect injury. So their theory under (a) and under (c) of section 1962 factually is exactly the same. The only reason that they brought in an (a) claim is, as I pointed out, to defendant. But I would point out here, in further answer York, under the Holmes test, is the proper plaintiff for purposes of vindicating the law's purposes, which after all, is to negate the activity of fraud.",
  "There are cases that have so held, and I think this Court's decision in Pasquantino, which holds that the tax revenue from a governmental entity can be property within the meaning of the fraud statutes, would support a general notion that a State could, in fact, if it believed that that was necessary to vindicate the law's purposes would be appropriate. Of course, here, the State of New York has got to get to that level through a very long series of steps, and it hasn't even approached, you know, the initial steps in terms of even bringing civil claims against National. seemed to rely on an earlier case that is much featured in Respondent's brief, but I don't recall your dealing knowingly hiring undocumented aliens and paying them less than the minimum wage, which gave that person a competitive edge over rivals who -- who paid what the law required?",
  "That, Justice Ginsburg, may give rise to certain legal remedies and certain harms, but we submit it would be too indirect for a RICO treble damages claim. There certainly could be an unfair competition claim under State law, perhaps a tortious interference with business advantage. But the purpose of RICO is not to federalize unfair competition law. And this point, we submit is very important because they could not bring a fraud claim under State law. It's not in their complaint, but --",
  "It could, Justice Alito, in this way. Congress has certainly announced, through a to deter and to minimize the use of violence and force against individuals. And the Hobbs Act is quite broadly worded in the context of robbery and extortion, certainly. The question, though, of whether or not an indirectly sustained injury -- in your hypothetical, something like competitive advantage -- would be sustainable -- I think would be looked at through the Holmes inquiry whether or not the damages that are asserted are too attenuated to be readily ascertained.",
  "It can --",
  "Because if -- depending on the exact facts of how the violence was done, whether or not the injury that is sustained is direct within the Holmes factors --",
  "Yes, it would because there is a better defendant A which got extorted for purpose of vindicating the extortion --",
  "Yes. bribed a -- an official of the New York revenue department to impose unnecessarily high taxes on the competitor?",
  "That is starting to get more indirect, but I think that that probably would be sufficient to show injury because the State of New York is not suffering any kind of property loss or any other kind of harm other than honest services.",
  "I -- I don't think that that hypothetical in any substantive way is different from the second one, Justice Stevens.",
  "No. I -- I think -- I think that the -- the question of how government behaves, for purposes of its discharge of public responsibilities, you know, is treated through a lens that goes to there. And I assume that the State of New York has various laws that can be enforced in a way -- license inspector or somebody every Monday night to go out and -- and inspect very heavily the competitor and cause all sorts of nuisance values and so forth. But he's a State official, induced to do that by some kind of bribery or fraud on the part of the defendant. Would there be a cause of action there or not?",
  "Not under -- well, I don't think there would be a cause of action by the competitor under RICO because, again, those damages are too indirect. That's not very different from the Associated General Contracting case where there were -- there was thought to be coercion on the part of the association against the labor unions, and this Court held that that was insufficient for proximate cause.",
  "Well, I think, Justice and I would acknowledge that this is a -- a somewhat nebulous area when you --",
  "The difficulty, Justice Breyer, as -- as that series of hypotheticals plays out in the real world is that defendants who have to defend against actions are forced to deal with the truth of pleadings for purposes of 12(b)(6). And as happened in this case, where the plaintiff can, through artful pleading, you know, navigate through these series of proximate cause issues, can plead facts that courts have to be assuming as true, reach a legal conclusion that there is, in fact, proximate cause --",
  "But --",
  "But -- but I would submit that the rule as articulated is one that would have some administration issues. I think it is certainly an easier case where there is a broad-spread competitive harm as a result of a lowering of a particular competitor's costs or a particular defendant's costs and one where there is a fraud that is specifically directed at a piece of property for which --",
  "-- the plaintiff asserts a claim.",
  "That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice. But under the Holmes test, that becomes much easier to ascertain because you know where the damages are. You don't have to worry about apportioning damages among multiple plaintiffs, and there may not be a better plaintiff. So I think if you applied the Holmes factors in this test here and to the example that you gave, the answer is a fairly straightforward one. If I could turn to the second point of proximate cause that we have raised, it's that as a matter of zone of interest standing, because Ideal is not the defrauded party, they fall outside the zone of interests protected by the fraud statutes. It's been well accepted at common law and through this Court's incorporation of common law principles as a means of interpreting the RICO statute, that the predicate act protected. Here, because of the allegations of fraud within the zone of interest that the -- of the fraud provisions. Ideal is not. Ideal falls outside the zone, and under the way that some courts have viewed proximate cause analysis, that would be sufficient. The second large point that I came here to argue today was that reliance was improperly analyzed by the court below. At common law, reliance is a necessary element of fraud. Ideal, for similar reasons to the zone of interest analysis, is not the party that relied on any misrepresentations by my client, National and the Anzas. And therefore, it cannot assert a fraud claim because of that absence of reliance.",
  "I do, Justice Scalia, and --",
  "Our briefs make that concession clear, I think, Justice Scalia. If I could reserve the balance of my time.",
  "I'd like to return to Justice Souter's hypothetical because I think that the point of price competition fits squarely within the Holmes case. If you were to take the fact of bankruptcy, the mere going bankrupt of the brokers in that case, the -- the effect of that on the customers who are attempting to bootstrap in the securities fraud fits perfectly here because the fraud here against the State of New York enables National allegedly to engage in price competition. But as you pointed out in your hypothetical, price competition is not a RICO violation. And using 1964(c)'s by reason of, the injury has to be by the RICO violation. Simply lowering prices or making their goods more economically affordable does not cause -- is not a RICO violation. The -- the RICO violation, if there is one here, is in the fraudulent underpayment of taxes to the State of New York. does, we acknowledge, make the suggestion about possible third party reliance, but it does not cite any cases, one of which is the decision below, which we argue was wrongly decided. The point that the SG, I think, was making was acknowledging that there are these circumstances, and I would advert to my earlier colloquy with Justice Scalia in which there are limited circumstances in which a third party can invoke the reliance. But that is ordinarily done through a relationship among the parties. The breadth of the Respondent's position here should not go uncommented upon. RICO is not an unfair competition statute. Yet, the answers to the hypotheticals about how many competitors would be able to bring and whether or not they were directly targeted and the cigarette hypothetical all point to the fact that, at bottom, their theory is that any action on the part of a defendant that leads to an indirect ability to engage in price competition would give rise to a RICO claim. And as we point out in our reply brief, there are literally millions -- just on taxes alone, millions -- of submissions by corporations that could accepted by this Court as the predicate for a RICO claim. We submit that the floodgates should not be the difficulties of proving harm and damages are especially present here and that antitrust cases should not be shoehorned under the RICO statute. That is not what Congress intended. Finally, with respect to reliance, this Court in Beck v. Prupis held that civil conspiracy principles should be imported into the understanding of what a civil action under RICO should be permitted. And the common law is well settled that reliance is an element that is appropriate for it to be imported into the mail fraud predicate act here because the damages have to be shown by some type of relationship between the defrauded party and the defendant. If the Court has no further questions.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns the appealability of remand orders under the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act, or SLUSA. Our position is that the general rule prohibiting appealability applies in this case for three reasons. First, section 1447(d) has been consistently construed to prohibit appeal of remand orders based on a district court's lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. That rule governs even if the district court incorrectly construes a subject-matter jurisdiction provision. Second, SLUSA section 77p(c) concededly defines removal jurisdiction and it does so by incorporating the criteria for preemption. Thus, the court's subject-matter jurisdiction is coextensive with those cases that SLUSA preempts. And third, Congress knows how to make remand orders appealable when it wants to, but SLUSA contains no provision for appellate review of remand orders. Under Respondent's approach, the Federal courts would obtain jurisdiction in cases not subject to SLUSA preemption, but there's no indication that Congress intended that result.",
  "No, it's not.",
  "Because under this Court's longstanding precedent, for there to be preclusion, there must be a right of appellate review. So if you agree that the general rule of 1447(d) applies and there is no right to appeal the remand order, then the basis on which that order is -- is founded, the preemption of SLUSA is open for the State court to address on remand.",
  "That's correct, through the State court system.",
  "He was wrong. He was wrong. The issue of preemption under SLUSA can be raised by the defendants on remand in the State courts. It can be litigated. It's important to note that the removal provision says, shall be removable. It's at the defendants' discretion whether they want to ask the Federal court to test whether SLUSA preempts the case or to keep it in State court for the State court to apply SLUSA and thereby hold that the class action would be unsustainable.",
  "There are cases in the lower courts, Your Honor, in the complete preemption area that have held that a removal based on the doctrine of complete preemption was not sustainable because the case was not completely preempted, but holding that preemption, implied conflict preemption, can be applied by the State courts on remand. And it's important to note here that there --",
  "Not that I'm aware of, but what the City of Waco case says, upon which they base their reliance, is that the reason why there was appeal of that particular order was because it would be held preclusive. Here, it would not be held preclusive because there is no right of appellate review.",
  "That is certainly true, although I would take issue with the notion of there being a colorable claim. I don't think that the SLUSA removal is analogous to the Federal officer removal statute where the statute itself says the defense has to be under color of law, and this Court in the Mesa v. California case said that phrase is where the colorable claim creates article III jurisdiction.",
  "But I -- I don't -- sorry. If I could just finish. I don't contest the rest of it, which is that on remand, preemption can be developed through amended pleadings, through facts that are developed --",
  "Well, under their theory, though, Justice Ginsburg, the court could, because of their construction of the removal jurisdiction provision, would retain jurisdiction.",
  "Well, and we think that that position that they have advanced in this Court is incorrect, and I would agree with your postulate that what the Federal district court does and it has jurisdiction to do is to decide whether preemption applies and then remand the case, or if preemption does apply, to dismiss it.",
  "It does -- it does do that. It's actually --",
  "I thought I expressed my position there.",
  "That's -- on the basis of the record then before it.",
  "Yes.",
  "The court always has the authority to have evidence taken to determine its own jurisdiction. That's routinely done by district courts.",
  "I -- I agree with you that that is how the Seventh Circuit described the opinion and what -- what the adjudicatory authority was, and that is why we take issue with the Seventh Circuit. We do think that the State court on remand has any issue that the defendants want to raise before it. All that the Federal district court has done is to decide that -- that there was no basis for a SLUSA preemption because the requisites of subsection (b) had been satisfied. But I want to point out that the issue before you is whether or not that decision, correct or not, is appealable. And what is important in the error of the Seventh Circuit was that they held that that decision was appealable, and under the Thermtron rule, as applied in Gravitt and Things Remembered, even a district court decision that is erroneous in its construction of a subject-matter jurisdiction provision is still a remand based on subject-matter jurisdiction and therefore falls within the four corners --",
  "And our problem with that, Justice Breyer, is that all eight district court decisions here thought that they were deciding subject- matter jurisdiction, and they thought that because Federal preemption ordinarily is not a basis for removal. And --",
  "It -- it is --",
  "Well, functionally it is the equivalent of codifying the complete preemption doctrine, which is how SLUSA actually works. And in the complete preemption cases, Beneficial Bank is what spells out this --",
  "It would be a strikingly odd result, though, for this Court to reach that, given that Congress has clearly provided for appellate review of remand orders in other contexts, including in the Class Action Fairness Act, under tribal property disputes, the FDIC, the RTC, and specifically in 1447(d) itself, civil rights cases. So Congress knows how to do this if that's what Congress had intended.",
  "Well, I think that the closest analogy, again, is in the complete preemption area where the Court has held that, you know, the removal is based on complete preemption, and if that is found by the district court, that functionally terminates the litigation. But I would point out that even in the Federal officer removal statute, there's no appellate review of a district court's decision that the Federal officer statute was improperly invoked to remove an action. So what the securities defendants here are asking for is something Congress didn't even give to Federal officers.",
  "It had the -- it had the power to determine whether SLUSA applied.",
  "And that's what section 77p(c), when it says, as set forth in subsection (b), is referring to. So the district court analyzed those factors and it came --",
  "Yes.",
  "Because the courts held that the requisites of SLUSA of subsection (b) had not been satisfied.",
  "That's correct.",
  "It is possible, but that's why the issue of the underlying district court's determination is not before you. The issue before you is can appellate jurisdiction be asserted to review that decision. But I would further point out, Justice Stevens, that the Dabit court assiduously avoided the kinds of claims that are present in our case, which is whether or not negligence can be asserted against the securities defendants for failure to fair-value price. Dabit was strictly a fraud case, as this Court made clear. This is a negligence case, and there is a part of subsection (b) which makes very clear that what SLUSA is getting at are claims based on fraud. But even if you were to disagree that the -- the district court had, you know, an alternate basis that had not been properly ventilated or addressed by the district court because it went off on the holder theory that this Court rejected in Dabit, you still wouldn't have jurisdiction to decide that because of the general rule of 1447(d), which provides, as I have stated, that a court doesn't have jurisdiction to review -- appellate review of a remand order.",
  "That's incorrect, Justice Ginsburg. We've put the complaints before you. They are in the joint appendix. We have cited every paragraph in which those claims are asserted. The Seventh Circuit based its decision about that on a misunderstanding of the colloquy at oral argument in the Seventh Circuit, which Respondent's have recited the Web site. You can listen to the argument yourself. It did not contain any type of concession by counsel for the class that these claims were anything other than the negligence claims, which on the four corners of the complaint, they assert themselves to be.",
  "The briefs recounted what the claims are, which are negligence claims.",
  "Well, the Seventh Circuit made five crucial errors, that it was wrong to describe the district court as saying that removal was proper. The district court didn't say that. They were wrong to say that the remand was based on section 77(d)(4). That's not what the district court did. They were wrong to evaluate section 77p(c) without even reciting or construing the language. They were wrong to say that SLUSA's substantive decisions, quote, must be made by the Federal rather than the State judiciary. That's not correct. And they were wrong to say that it was now or never for appellate review whether an action under State law is preempted.",
  "But the point, Mr. Chief Justice, is that this is on a basis of subject-matter jurisdiction. It's not waivable and we're permitted to say that a district court decision based on subject- matter jurisdiction can look at the relevant claims. It is true that the perception at the time was that these holder theories evaded SLUSA. All of the courts up until that time of Kircher II had held that, and that's not an unreasonable position for a lawyer to take. Now, certainly after Dabit, those claims are foreclosed where there are holder fraud claims. We do -- we obviously don't take issue with that. But here, the claims in the complaint themselves are based on negligence, and it is certainly fair --",
  "Well, this Court in the Santa Fe case, Mr. Chief Justice, said that negligence claims are not within 10b-5. Those are claims that are properly brought under State law.",
  "So if the -- if the State court applies Dabit and Santa Fe, it will come to the conclusion that the holder theory is preempted under Dabit, but the negligence theory is not preempted under the Santa Fe case.",
  "It does come up often because the securities bar, every time they get a district court decision that they don't like, they want to appeal it, notwithstanding the general bar of appealability. So this issue is something that is very important to both sides in the development of this law. But I would further point out, Justice Breyer, that as this case has come up, your -- your view would have to be based on do you have appellate jurisdiction, and our submission is that you don't, subject for purposes of remanding the case in light of Dabit.",
  "Well, in the Cohill case, this Court addressed the situation where there was a Federal dismissal of the claims and the -- and the Federal district court remanded the State claims for consideration under -- under State jurisdiction. And the Court had internal discussion about whether or not, you know, there was appealability of what was left in the case. Our -- our position is that ordinarily a dismissal of a Federal claim is an appealable matter and that that is subject to appeal, but that a remand decision, which is what the district court made in this case, is not.",
  "No, it shouldn't and the reason it shouldn't is because Congress has decided that it shouldn't. Congress has decided that there is a paramount interest in having decisions made on their merits, which is why there is not appellate review of remand orders. That's --",
  "No, Justice Alito, to the contrary. They are being decided by Federal district courts. They're just no subject to appellate review, and it was because --",
  "No. Well, the -- the merits of the case are going to be decided by the State court. The question of whether there's a Federal defense based on SLUSA in the first instance is decided by the district court in remanding the case, and then if there becomes a basis through evidence or amendment to the pleadings or whatnot, if the defendants want to re- raise their SLUSA preemption argument, they are certainly free to do that.",
  "No, it is decided.",
  "It is decided by the Federal court within the confines of what Congress has determined based on its wording of SLUSA and its fact that, as this Court has said in Things Remembered, the Congress is presumed to accept the general rule of nonappealability unless it says so.",
  "I'm saying that it is final for purposes of remand.",
  "And that in terms --",
  "Because -- because what SLUSA does is it has an interplay between the removal jurisdiction provision and it says, as set forth in subsection (b).",
  "That is a policy choice that Congress made when not providing a special mechanism for appellate review of remand orders.",
  "That's correct, and that's where the uniformity of decisions would come from, the reviews by plaintiffs who's had their -- who have had their cases dismissed. Those are subject to appeal. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you. I think it's really important for you to look at the complaints in these cases because every single one of them asserts claims on the basis of negligence and the value -- the fair-value pricing of the securities. They are not based on misrepresentations. The other side has attempted to make them look like misrepresentations, and they've quoted things out of context in order to do so. But the complaints themselves are pure negligence claims that would fall outside of SLUSA. But even if you were to disagree with that and even if you were to disagree with the district court's basis for saying that remand was proper because it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, the general rule of Thermtron, Things Remembered, and importantly, the Gravitt case applies. And this Court does not have appellate jurisdiction. The Seventh Circuit does not have appellate jurisdiction because of the plain language of section 1447(d). Respondents concede that State courts can decide SLUSA questions. It is up to defendants to decide whether to try to remove them. And subsection (d), about which Mr. Perry spoke, expressly provides that certain kinds of securities actions shall be remanded because Congress was not so concerned that Federal courts decide everything concerning securities cases, but only as to those that are expressly set forth in subsection (b). And, Mr. Chief Justice, respectfully, what subsection (c) is doing with its references to subsection (b) are to incorporate those criteria as one of the three elements or criteria for removability. It has to be a covered security, has to be a covered class action, and it has to meet the requisites of subsection (b). That's the only reasonable way to read that. And the last clause is simply confirmatory that if those are -- are met, then the district court has to find that the case shall be precluded. In the Gravitt case, in which this Court through a per curiam dismissed the appeal, there was a dispute between the district court and the court of appeals over whether the district court had properly applied subject-matter jurisdiction principles in deciding whether or not there was diversity. This Court said, no matter. That is outside the -- the requisite -- that is outside 1447(d), and the general rule against appealability applies. Now, importantly, they argue that they would be precluded by -- from arguing against SLUSA preemption in State court, but in fact, the last brief -- the last page of our brief, our reply brief, cites the Standefer case in which this Court held, under contemporary principles -- and I'm quoting now -- under contemporary principles of collateral estoppel, the inability to pursue an appeal is a factor strongly militating against giving a judgment preclusive effect.",
  "Yes, there would be. And there would be -- their argument about the Missouri Pacific case is wrong because what the -- what was going on there was the remand determination, not the underlying Federal right. And that's what would be appealed, and there would also be appeal of the preclusive consequences because that would be a question of Federal law under this Court's longstanding determination. The Restatement --",
  "That would be covered. And -- and the reason is that it is -- involved a manipulation. The wording of SLUSA involves a manipulation of -- of the security.",
  "What -- what we're talking about here, Justice Stevens -- it's important -- is that in how these securities get priced, was there negligence in the pricing of those, that had deleterious effects on one class of holders but not on market-timers that we were moving in and out of the market. And so, frankly, Judge Easterbrook was wrong for a sixth reason, and that was in saying that there would have been a derivative claim here too because a derivative case has to be brought on behalf of the corporation on behalf of all shareholders --",
  "The district court was wrong in not anticipating what this Court held in Dabit, but it was not wrong insofar as it held that there was no subject-matter jurisdiction because this case is based on negligence and not fraud. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. In 1988, the Government of British Columbia created Powerex to perform a variety of public functions including the marketing of surplus hydropower generated by development of the Province's natural resources pursuant to bilateral agreements with the United States. The Ninth Circuit, however, denied Powerex its rightful status as an organ of a foreign State entitled to remove this case from State court to Federal court. Before addressing the appellate jurisdiction issue, I'd like to highlight briefly the two key errors by the Ninth Circuit in rejecting Powerex's organ status. First, the court articulated the wrong test for determining an entity's status as an organ of a foreign State. The factors the Ninth Circuit found dispositive are inconsistent with the FSIA; and second, the court overlooked crucial evidence of Powerex's public functions that are the best indication of its sovereign status. The British Columbia Government receives and distributes the proceeds from Powerex's operations, supervises Powerex through BC Hydro, subjects Powerex to provincial laws not applicable to private companies and grants Powerex special benefits including exemption from taxation.",
  "Yes. Let me address that now. The court's -- the district court's remand order was appealable because it was not issued under 1447(c).",
  "The district court made two mutually exclusive statements, that remand was proper and that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Because of that inconsistency, the court of appeals - -",
  "Sorry. That removal was proper under the sovereign removal provisions of 1441(d) and 1442(a). It also then said it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.",
  "But immunity was the basis of the district court's thinking that it had to remand.",
  "And what this Court's cases say, Justice Souter, is that the remand has to be a ground cognizable under 1447(c).",
  "I certainly do - -",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, the Thermtron rule has been reaffirmed no less than four times by this Court, notwithstanding two statutory amendments. It has been reaffirmed and stare decisis on the basis of statute is the strongest form of stare decisis. So I do - -",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, the Thermtron rule was reaffirmed earlier this term in the Osborn case, has been reaffirmed in prior cases lead - - from the time it was decided even through statutory amendments. Our submission is that if Congress intended to change that rule, it could have done so clearly. And we note that the Respondents here don't ask for Thermtron to be overruled, and it is clear from the amicus on their side, that the only way you could rule in favor of the Respondents in this case would be to overrule Thermtron.",
  "But here, Justice Ginsburg, the court did have jurisdiction because removal was properly effectuated once the entities that we moved were identified correctly as sovereigns, either foreign sovereigns in the case of BC Hydro, or Federal sovereigns in the case of BPA.",
  "No, you're not, Justice Scalia, and here's why. Immunity is not a ground for remand because it is not a precondition for a removal by a sovereign. It is a separate freestanding issue. It is a status determination that determines whether removal is proper by those sovereigns.",
  "But if in Thermtron the court, the district court had said my docket is too busy, I therefore lack subject matter jurisdiction and remand under 1447(c), I don't think there's any doubt that the courts would look beyond the label given.",
  "I'm speaking hypothetically, Justice Ginsburg. My point is that the label the district court attached here was the wrong label, and that's why the court of appeals to satisfy - -",
  "Because it is inconsistent with the notion that remand orders have no preclusive effect to remand a case on the ground that the sovereigns are immune, and force them to relitigate their immune status in State court. That is precisely why Congress enacted these sovereign removal provisions.",
  "That's our backup submission, Justice Souter. You do not need to reach that if you agree with our principal submission and - -",
  "But Justice Souter, it did so. The case -- the cases in which the Court has said so have always been grounds -- jurisdictional grounds cognizable under 1447(c). Immunity from suit is not such a ground, because the purpose of having the removal provision on the basis of status is to allow the Federal courts to decide the immunity status. If the court sends the case back to State court on immunity grounds, it does not have preclusive effect in the State courts. The State courts will be obliged to relitigate sovereign immunity status and there will be no recourse except through appeal through the State court - -",
  "No.",
  "No, Justice Scalia, that's not our backup argument. Our point is that in this case, the district court had jurisdiction by virtue of the successful removals, which everybody conceded were correct, that the label that it attached, immunity is subject matter jurisdiction, is not a label for a ground recognized in 1447(c). So it was appropriate for the court of appeals to exercise appellate jurisdiction to determine whether or not the remand was a mandatory remand under 1447(c) or a discretionary one of the type this Court has recognized in the Cohill case.",
  "I don't believe that we did, Justice Ginsburg. This case was remanded. A motion - - motions for clarification were subsequently brought. But a 1292(b) order was not requested by Powerex.",
  "It is certainly the case that in searching through the docket entries, you'll discover that there was a holding by the district court of the remand, which is in itself an unusual procedure. But the point that is important here is that even apart from that, when the court had jurisdiction pursuant to the removal provisions, it did not lose subject matter jurisdiction by finding the immunity claims upon the part of the Federal and foreign sovereigns. And it is their theory that the district court never had subject matter jurisdiction, and that has to be wrong because it conflicts with the purposes behind the removal provision to give the sovereigns the opportunity to litigate their immunity defenses in Federal court.",
  "Their submission in this Court, however, is that there was no subject matter jurisdiction.",
  "Well, their backup argument should be rejected by the Court as wrong.",
  "Justice Breyer, there's no provision - -",
  "By the time the appeals in the State court would have been exhausted, the very benefits - -",
  "We would certainly make the argument.",
  "Justice Breyer, I would not want to foreclose any arguments that we might try to make; but let me point out to you that in the years that it would take to march through the State court system, Powerex, as a sovereign, would be denied its right to have a bench trial - -",
  "I do think foreign sovereigns are different, and Congress intended to treat --",
  "The foreign sovereign is entitled to a bench trial. It is entitled to other procedural protections with respect to treatment of garnishment, other - -",
  "It would be after -- it would be - -",
  "But Mr. Chief Justice, the point of having Congress enact these removal provisions and to ensure jurisdiction in the federal court for sovereigns on the basis of their status is entirely to vindicate those rights and interests. If Powerex were sued for not - -",
  "Diversity is different, Justice Scalia, and here's why. When a case is removed on diversity grounds, the court of appeals -- the district court is obliged to examine the bases of diversity. That is what the court's removal duty is. When a foreign sovereign removes a case, the district court's duty is to determine is this a foreign State within the meaning of the FSIA. If it is, I have jurisdiction.",
  "Justice Stevens, I don't think we would win at all in that circumstance because we would be forced as a foreign State to litigate in State court contrary to Congress's will.",
  "Whatever arguments that may be preserved - -",
  "It is certainly not impossible, but the point - -",
  "It is unclear to me, and I'm not sure that I've seen any of this Court's cases that would suggest that the denial of that kind of procedural right would be grounds for reversing a State court judgment. And our position is that Congress intended to protect the bench trial right, the immunity defenses of a foreign sovereign, because the organ status questioned - -",
  "I don't recall whether the Defendants do, but it is clear that the Plaintiffs would be entitled to a jury trial - -",
  "Well, the case has settled, Justice Ginsburg, prior to the formal invocation of trial procedures, and so - -",
  "As explained in the cert petition papers, the case is on appeal in the State court system on objections to the settlement, and it will not be mooted during the course of this Court's action on the case. But the invocation of jury that would be done normally just before trial has not been an issue that's been presented.",
  "Well, what the Plaintiffs here assert is that they would be denied their right to jury trial, and I presume that that means they intend to ask for one and to perpetuate that request. Our position, as we explain in a footnote in our reply brief, is that they have a jury trial right as against Duke and Reliant; they do not as against the foreign sovereigns that they have sued. So at root, the case is about the kind of comity and dignity that the courts of the United States will accord to foreign sovereigns. If Powerex were sued on the basis of non-commercial acts, it would not be entitled to have its immunity defense vindicated if the district court is held to have no jurisdiction, notwithstanding the proper removal under 1441(d). I'd like to save the reminder of my time for rebuttal, please.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, a non-jury trial is an aspect of sovereign immunity. This Court's cases have recognized that. In footnote 6 of the Government's brief, the Government cites the Lehman case which makes this point clear and argues that the point should be applicable to sovereigns in the context in which we are faced here. The question of whether a foreign entity, and it's more complicated often in the real world, Justice Breyer, as your question's identified not simply with questions but with the kinds of entities that foreign governments create to advance public purposes. The intent of Congress was not to have those kinds of entities tested in State court to determine whether or not they enjoyed the privileges and procedural protections of the FSIA. And it is not simply a question of whether or not an elderly judge might choose to recognize China or Formosa, but rather the kinds of instrumentalities that were created by those governments to advance public purposes, to serve as separate political entities, and who would be performing the kinds of acts that might lead them into litigation, and - -",
  "That's not all that's at stake, Justice Ginsburg. There are also rights with respect to foreign states to be free of punitive damages. There are rights to have certain property of the sovereign that would be subject to different attachment rules. The FSIA has a whole string of procedural protections that are afforded to foreign states and their instrumentalities. And this case ultimately is about the fact that Powerex is being subjected to multiple suits in State court, but as a result of the Ninth Circuit's holding in - -",
  "They have been directly sued by the People of the State of California whom my brother here represents. They have been sued by the California Attorney General. They have been sued by the California Department of Water Resources. And under the Ninth Circuit's precedent in this case which I urge you to overturn, Powerex has been remanded to State court, has not been permitted to appeal the remand order, and is stuck in State court in these cases without any opportunity to test what is a clearly erroneous, and what my brother doesn't make any attempt to defend, the merits of the decision, that Powerex has performed public functions, it's serving at the direction of the Government of British Columbia, and is performing these functions to advance clearly public purposes. And yet, we are now in this Kafkaesque work world between State and Federal court where if we try to litigate all the way up through State court, it is not entirely clear whether we will ever have our organ - - our status as a foreign organ ever vindicated. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Eighth Circuit held that Philip Morris is subject to such specific and detailed regulations by the Federal Trade Commission that it is entitled to remove this purely State law case from State court to Federal court under the Federal officer removal statute. That holding is erroneous and should be reversed for at least three reasons. First, the court articulated the wrong test for determining when a person is acting under a Federal officer. Second, the court misunderstood the Federal Trade Commission's regulatory regime with respect to the marketing of so-called light cigarettes. And third, the court's approach ignores the long history and purposes of the federal officer removal provision to protect the Federal Government operations from interference by State court proceedings. In this case, and in this Court, Philip Morris largely abandons the Eighth Circuit's rationale and offers an alternate ground of affirmance. It should be rejected. The FTC has not delegated authority to conduct testing to Philip Morris, and the complaint in any event challenges only the company's marketing and not its testing of so-called light cigarettes. Now with respect to the first point, the Eighth Circuit applied and articulated the wrong test for determining when a person is acting under a federal officer. The proper test, as this Court's case in the City of Greenwood versus Peacock Casey elucidates, is when the person is aiding or acting on behalf of the Federal officer in a subordinate role in the officer's discharge of official functions. That is not what is happening here. What is happening here is that the Federal Trade Commission for a time conducted testing on the tar and nicotine levels of cigarettes and stopped doing so. Philip Morris asserts that that sequence of events caused, in effect, a delegation of this authority. But what is really happening is that Philip Morris - -",
  "No.",
  "No. There is nothing, Justice Scalia. There is no regulation, this is no order, there is no policy statement, there is no statement by the chairman of the FTC before Congress. There is nothing.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, the answer to your question is no. And the reason is that what the FTC did at the time was, it determined that this particular Cambridge filter method was the preferred method for ascertaining the level of tar and nicotine in cigarettes. And in the D.C. Circuit opinion of Federal - -",
  "That is correct. But what was clear in the Brown & Williamson case decided by the D.C. Circuit, a panel of Judges Bork, Scalia and Edwards - -",
  "They most assuredly did get it right, Mr. Chief Justice. What they held was that that method, the Cambridge filter method, had not been done according to rulemaking, a trade regulation rule; and that, therefore, there might be a testing mechanism that would be different and better, but that with respect to undertaking the deception analysis, which is what the FTC is charged by -- with doing under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission -- Federal Trade Act, it had to determine whether or not there would be some method that the cigarette makers were attempting to use that would be deceptive; and what the court in the D.C. Circuit held was that there was no other method that had been determined at that time. There had been no statement or proposed rule made by the FTC, and so for purposes of determining deception, that was the best that could be done, while leaving open the possibility that the FTC would promulgate the appropriate - -",
  "No. Because that's merely compliance with rule and not aiding or acting on behalf of the Government officer in a subordinate relationship in the discharge of function.",
  "The reporting of results doesn't change the hypothetical. That's also compliance with the law, and that happens all the time in the Government. The Department of Labor, the Department of Commerce, the Federal Reserve, all of those agencies routinely require reporting on the part of industry. But the reporting of information does not transform a regulated entity into a Federal officer for purposes of these cases. And the court's cases are highly instructive in this regard. Beginning with the act of 1815 that began the Federal officer removal, the court's cases have held that when a person is deemed to be acting under, the person is acting in a subordinate relationship to the Federal officer, merely complying with the law does not transform a regulated entity into someone subordinate to the officer. And that subordinate relationship is what is critical to understanding when in other contexts someone might have a better claim to being a person acting under a Federal officer than Philip Morris can assert in this case.",
  "The Government contractor cases present a quite distinct set of issues that, of course, is not present in this case because there is no contract between the Federal Trade Commission and Philip Morris. But I think that the proper way of looking at Government contractors is to look at contextually what is the nature of the contract? Does the contract provide for ongoing supervision by the Federal officer and give the Federal officer the power to change or alter the conduct of the contracting party? Otherwise, mere specifications, detailed as they might be, constitute simply compliance with the terms of the contract rather than a subordinate relationship.",
  "In a couple - -",
  "No. I think and that's why it would be - -",
  "-- a mistake for the Court to either categorically say all Government contractors are in or all Government contractors are out.",
  "No, it doesn't.",
  "Because my theory is that the person acting under has to be aiding or acting on behalf of a Federal officer in a subordinate relationship in the performance of the officer's official functions. And in the case of some Government contractors, like the chauffeur in Maryland versus Soper, for instance, who was an employee of the Reliable Transfer Company, he was hired by the Maryland Director of Prohibition to serve with the agents when they went out doing their investigations.",
  "That's a different question, Justice Scalia. The question of under color of office as the statute defines it depends on the nature of the acts and whether there is a causal relationship between the acts that are charged by the State in the State case and the actions of the people involved. In the Soper case, the problem wasn't the color of office, because the chauffeur was out with the four agents, and when there was a death that they stumbled upon, the question arose what were the nature of the facts, not whether the chauffeur was acting under color of office. That would be a distinct inquiry not related specifically to whether a person is acting under, but that's the third part of this question.",
  "And in the Medicare context this happens. Blue Cross-Blue Shield, hired out by the Government to pursuant to a very detailed contract to engage in intermediary payments, and audits, forming Government functions. I think that is a paradigmatic instance where the Government consists -- and has ongoing supervisory relationship and a control over the conduct as it is implementing the Government's function. The Government employment example, like Soper, where the chauffeur is hired and brought into work with the agents, they're having a ongoing supervisory relationship, telling him where to drive, what to do, where to go. They are able to alter his conduct in the same way. In many procurement instances, that is not true.",
  "That's compliance with the regulation. There are all sorts of instances, Justice Kennedy, where industry is required to do certain things before they can bring their product to market. That's not acting - -",
  "They are performing a function at the Government's direction for the Government. The Government used to - -",
  "No. Compliance doesn't constitute a delegation, Mr. Chief Justice. And the reason is quite clear from the fact that the Code of Federal Regulations is full of all sorts of very specific instructions to industry actors. But when they comply with those rules they are not acting on behalf of the Government. They are simply fulfilling a legal obligation that all Americans have to fulfill when confronted with a question of Federal law. The situation for acting under is different, and in the Medicaid context, there's a very special bureaucracy that has been created under the Secretary of Health and Human Services to perform Government functions that used to be performed that are now contracted out to Blue Cross-Blue Shield, and I acknowledge that that is a very different kind of situation. But the Government, of course, in a multi-trillion-dollar budget purchases all sorts of items all the time. Many of them are off the shelf. And others are subject to very specific and detailed specifications. But the compliance by a contractor with specific and detailed instructions would not itself transform that entity into a person acting under a Federal officer.",
  "Because it would be transforming a preemption defense into an opportunity to use a Federal officer removal to have a case from State court to Federal court. This Court has said many times that preemption is an issue that can be decided by State courts, and the mere fact that someone is complying with detailed Federal regulations, and therefore is able to claim the cause of action is preempted as a result of those Federal regulations, does not transform the person into a person acting under a Federal officer.",
  "It depends on the nature of the contract, Justice Scalia. The things that the Court would look at would depend - -",
  "What the Court - -",
  "What the Court would look at is whether there is a ongoing supervisory relationship and whether the Federal officer has the power to transform or alter the conduct. If those circumstances are met, then there would be a very strong argument that the person is acting under the Federal officer.",
  "Of course, this Court has held that in that context there is not State action in that particular circumstance. In fact, in the Third Circuit, Philip Morris defended its actions against a very similar claim regarding its marketing, that it was not a State actor for purposes of a Bivens action or a Section 1983 claim.",
  "There -- that would certainly be a simple way to determine whether a person is acting under a Federal officer, if it meets the entwinement test articulated by this Court in that case.",
  "If it doesn't - -",
  "No, I think that the proper standard, Justice Scalia, as I've said, is whether there is a ongoing supervisory relationship and the Government has the power to alter the actor's conduct. If those two conditions are met then a person can be said to be acting under the Federal officer within the meaning of this statute.",
  "But not on a basis that is I think appropriate to understand a subordinate relationship. The fact that there is alteration through Government regulation is simply compliance with law. But to be acting under within the meaning of this Court's cases -- and I would direct the Court to the Greenwood case, which the other side basically ignores -- in that case, in footnotes 17 and 20, this Court made clear that the phrase \"acting under\" is acting in that kind of subordinate relationship in the execution of laws. Compliance is insufficient. Otherwise, it would blow the whole statute apart. Everybody in a regulated industry would able to remove under the Federal officer statute.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, in our cert papers, and we didn't repeat them in our merits papers, we give examples where a window blinds manufacturer, a medical device manufacturer, a whole series of others, a bank, a credit union, have attempted -- after the Eighth Circuit's decision in this case have removed cases to Federal court on the grounds that they are Federal officers because they are subjected to far more extensive regulations than Philip Morris. In fact, if you turn to volume 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations and turn to part 408, there's a heading, and it says Deceptive Unfair Advertising of Cigarettes For Health Benefits. Then underneath it it says \"intentionally left blank.\" And the argument that these other entities have made is there are no Federal regulations concerning the marketing of \"light\" cigarettes but there are regulations concerning our products. So therefore, we must be a Federal officer because the regime governing us is far more specific and detailed than it is for cigarettes. If I could reserve the balance of my time.",
  "If this is a perfect case for Federal officer removal, there are easily 40,000 others in the State courts waiting to he removed.",
  "I don't know the answer to that, but I can tell you that in lots and lots of areas, the Federal Government wants safer, cleaner cars, safer refrigerators - -",
  "They do - -",
  "It does not make a difference. And the reason it doesn't make a difference is if you look on your refrigerator, if you look on your lawn mower, if you look on your automobile, there are Government standard tests that have to be complied with for an industry to be able to sell its products. And if Philip Morris is correct here, you are going to be announcing a dramatic transformation of the role of Federal and State courts, because every time there is even a colorable argument for preemption, the industry will take the case to Federal court saying we're acting under the Federal officer, and therefore, don't - -",
  "The description shouldn't make a difference, particularly where it is in a voluntary agreement that was not put out for notice and comment rulemaking, and it was done for precisely this reason, Justice Scalia. For decades, the cigarette companies were rightly perceived as deceiving the public about the health content of their products.",
  "They also said, Mr. Chief Justice, that they expected the companies to police each other, which is exactly what happened when the Barclay cigarette came up. Philip Morris was the one that complained and said that cigarette doesn't comply, it's been manipulating the FTC Cambridge filter method. So the FTC found a cheaper way to do regulation. Compliance with rules does not transform an entity into a Federal officer. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our position can be summarized in two words: Boundaries matter. Boundaries determine where States can make grants of land, and they determine where a State can exercise its police powers. And with respect to both principle, the Special Master got it exactly right. Nothing in Article VII or elsewhere in the Compact of 1905 precludes the State of New Jersey from exercising its police powers within the boundary determined by this Court in its 1934 boundary decision. And, in fact, at 291 --",
  "No. Our position is that --",
  "No, they can -- under Delaware law, a riparian owner in New Jersey can extend past the low-water mark as has been permitted by New Jersey, by Delaware in every single instance since 1961 when Delaware enacted subaqueous land laws, except the two times where New Jersey riparian owners sought to violate Delaware's laws by building LNG facilities: In 1972 when the El Paso Company sought to build an LNG facility and was denied by Delaware and New Jersey acquiesced in that denial, and then in 2005 when Delaware made the status determination that the Crown Landing facility was a prohibited bulk transfer facility precluded by Delaware law.",
  "Delaware can exercise its police authority as --",
  "Yes.",
  "The statute is not effected in the hypothetical that you give. Nothing in Delaware subaqueous land laws goes to clutter, visual or otherwise, on the bank.",
  "That statute would be subject to Delaware takings law, and Delaware has found that --",
  "It depends. Justice Souter, it depends.",
  "The Constitution of the United States and the constitution of Delaware. A private --",
  "The Delaware statute would not be affected by the 1905 Compact, Justice Souter, because Delaware would assert presumably, if defending that law, that it was subject to regular police power restrictions. But those police power restrictions --",
  "No.",
  "I don't think that Delaware would prevail on a blanket prohibition of the exercise of riparian rights by New Jersey landowners.",
  "Because Delaware has always permitted the exercise of riparian rights because --",
  "Delaware certainly has the power, under our theory of the case as recommended by the Special Master, to implement its police powers. Those police powers are always subject to constitutional constraints. And under the hypothetical you posed, as extreme as it is, Justice Souter, the Constitution, both under Delaware law and under the United States Constitution, might well say the State has gone too far in exercising its police --",
  "I'm not sure that you would need to go that far, certainly in light of the practical realities of the 150 years of shared use of the Delaware River, Justice Kennedy. Importantly, under New Jersey's theory, to go to your hypothetical, Justice Souter, where the entire bed of the river within the Twelve-Mile Circle would be built out, that would be a functional abrogation of this Court's boundary decision, because this Court held that the land under the piers was not belonging to New Jersey and that an attempt to extend the entire boundary outward, water-ward, would be overriding what this Court determined was the -- easement.",
  "That becomes a dormant Commerce Clause problem, Justice Souter.",
  "Justice Scalia, under a broad theory of where the boundary is in matters, it would require New Jersey to have access to grant Delaware lands. And under our theory as accepted by the Special Master, that would not be permitted. If it is simply a question of use, we would acknowledge that the New Jersey riparian owner can --",
  "There were only two proven in the record, Justice Alito, and neither of which was proved in this record to go beyond the low-water mark. But, yes, you're right.",
  "Yes. Parts of the Twelve Mile Circle --",
  "No. In parts of the Twelve Mile Circle, Justice Scalia, particularly in Gloucester County, there's marshy area where the low-water area extends hundreds of feet into the river. And that is where the boundary is -- is determined. And it was not necessary in some places within the Twelve Mile Circle to go beyond the low-water mark in order to build a pier --",
  "Certainly.",
  "Certainly.",
  "Yes, Justice Alito.",
  "The last part of your question, Justice Alito, is where the rub lies, because riparian law was subject to the individual determination of what a riparian right was, and how the State's regulation of that right as a private property right would be determined. What this Court's cases uniformly hold is that the police power trumps that private riparian right, and this was recognized by the attorney general for New Jersey.",
  "I beg your pardon?",
  "No.",
  "No, because wharfing out is always dependent on whether or not it is so far into the river to impede the navigable channel, to become a nuisance, and none of the cases by this Court talking about wharfing rights concern the police powers issued by the State. Cummings v The City of Chicago held that the Federal riparian right given to the wharf owner in Chicago was not -- could not override a State's determination of how the wharf could be built, that police power. Hudson v McCarter --",
  "No.",
  "Justice --",
  "We are not going that far, Justice Kennedy. What we are saying --",
  "A wharf that impedes navigation is a nuisance that is subject to classic police power restrictions. A wharf that does not have any of those consequences is permitted and Delaware has permitted those wharves. In fact even recently when the State of New Jersey petitioned to Delaware to obtain a permit for the Fort Mott State Recreational Park, Delaware granted that to them.",
  "Delaware cannot say no more wharfs, but that doesn't answer the question that's really at the rub of this case, which is what you do on the wharf.",
  "And all of the law and evidence suggests that it is not. In fact, the riparian grants that New Jersey issued after its Wharf Act of 18 never contained a specification of use. They admitted in the record --",
  "Delaware has permitted that. The Keystone facility allows for bulk shipments of coal to be delivered and offloaded within the Twelve Mile Circle.",
  "They are distinctive rights. It's like -- it's like zoning laws, Justice Kennedy. You can own a piece of land but that does not mean that you can override the police powers of the State by what you do on land.",
  "Delaware's Subaqueous Lands Act makes that distinction.",
  "As a matter of police power --",
  "Delaware has to --",
  "It -- yes. It could. That if -- if it were deemed to be a proper exercise of its police authority, yes, it could.",
  "And the answer, Justice Souter, is not decided by the facts on the case here but rather on the individual circumstances. I appreciate that there are hypotheticals that --",
  "Indeed. Because there are constitutional constraints. There are dormant Commerce Clause considerations.",
  "The Compact does not contain the constraints, the Attorney General of New Jersey recognized it, and this is at the appendix starting at 905 of the Delaware appendix. In 1867 in New Jersey, Attorney General Robeson issued a very lengthy and scholarly opinion on the difference between the powers that a State could exercise over riparian rights, and he distinguished in that opinion between what he called the great public uses, which would be for defense, for the environment, for protection of the people's safety, and what were deemed to be public uses. Those who would be using those riparian lands for a railway bridge or a terminal that would be for commercial purposes. And he said that in the instance of the great public uses, there would not be a need to pay compensation because that great public right overrided the riparian proprietor's exercise of riparian right. With respect to the public use, however, and this is at page 910 to 911 Delaware's appendix, he said that with respect to those public uses, there might be a requirement for a taking or a payment of compensation. And so Justice Souter, I appreciate that our position has a frustration, in the sense that it does require individual facts. But I would submit to you that in the 160 years in which the -- New Jersey citizens have been wharfing into the Delaware River, Delaware has permitted that in every single instance, except two. And there are both liquified natural gas facilities.",
  "It is correct that Delaware regulated by the common law, Justice Ginsburg, but as the Special Master correctly found just because the limitation under the FX judicial precedents is for nuisances does not mean there is no regulation. When Delaware chose to override its common law riparian jurisdiction by implementing statutes, New Jersey acceded to them to the point that in its consideration of coastal zone management laws in the 1970s, the attorney general of New Jersey was specifically consulted whether compliance with the Federal statute and Delaware statutes was necessary. And in 1980 issued a coastal zone management plan, New Jersey did -- that recognized that if there was an LNG facility, the agreement of both states was necessary. The deponents in this case, every single one of them from the New Jersey side, including persons who had worked for the State for nearly 30 years, said that the entire time they had worked for the State, if the project crossed the boundary there had to be a permit obtained from the State of Delaware. We would submit that the constant --",
  "If the wharf extended beyond the boundary line, Mr. Chief Justice, a permit for the wharf, and that permit --",
  "It gives New Jersey the right to say who shall be the riparian owners to exercise their rights, what they can do, and up to the point where there would be an encroachment of the police power of the State, the permission to do that.",
  "The leading decision of this Court, Justice Kennedy, is a case called Shively v Bowlby, which was decided a few years before the 1905 Compact; and in that case this Court went through an exhaustive determination to show what the riparian rights were, State by State by State. The purpose there was to determine whether or not an Oregon riparian land owner had rights that were consistent under Oregon common law with those granted in a deed by Congress, and in order to do that the Court went through a very long examination and analysis of riparian rights as they existed in all --",
  "I'm saying yes, that under Delaware's -- no, it's --",
  "If it goes beyond the boundary, that is the position New Jersey --",
  "They have --",
  "Yes. There are prohibited uses, Justice Scalia.",
  "You have to get a license under New Jersey law, too, and that's the whole point of State officials by New Jersey saying compliance had to be with both laws.",
  "No.",
  "It protects the New Jersey landowners who in the interregnum between the 1905 Compact and this Court's boundary determination would have faced the uncertainty that their grants would be deemed puerperous by Delaware. What this Court said in its boundary decision was that the mere use of those was recognized by Delaware under the common law, was not deemed to be a nuisance, but in this Court's decision in Coffee versus Groover, a grant made by a state that does not have lawful title to the land would be deemed invalid. That case, which was decided in the late 1880s, invalidated grants that had been made by the State of Florida at a time when the boundary was uncertain. And this Court said that those grants were invalid in light of the uncertain title that the State had when it made those grants.",
  "Those would be deemed takings, Justice Alito.",
  "But it can be acquired by compensation, yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "The decision in Virginia v. Maryland is distinguishable in a number of ways, and if I could take a moment to go through those ways. The first is that it involved a different Compact with different language. The 1785 Compact between Virginia and Maryland specifically provided that each -- the citizens of each State shall have \"full property in the shores of the Potomac River.\" The court construed the phrase \"full property\" to include riparian rights.",
  "Yes.",
  "The Black-Jenkins award issued to resolve the boundary line was decided in 1877. And in that arbitration decision, Maryland specifically represented that the boundary should be drawn around the wharves that were on the Virginia side of the boundary so that the boundary, instead of being at the low-water mark, would carve out every pier that had been constructed. The arbitrators rejected that, but in the process provided that the riparian owners on the Virginia side could go beyond the low-water mark -- that is a direct quote -- \"beyond the low-water mark to exercise their riparian rights.\" Congress --",
  "The doubt here, Mr. Chief Justice, is what the phrase \"own side\" means. And we think the better reading of own side is captured by the grants part of the Special Master's recommendation is that own side means the boundary. But to the extent that a right can be exercised, a riparian right authorized by New Jersey beyond the low-water mark, it is still subject to the police powers. And at page 10 of the Special Master's report in Virginia v. Maryland, the Special Master specifically said this case does not concern the exercise of the police powers, but rather the mere withdrawal of the water. There is no issue here as to the types of general police powers that would apply to the riparian right. And finally, I would note that the Special Master was the same. He was uniquely positioned in this case to assess the applicability of Virginia v. Maryland because he had been the special master in that case, too.",
  "Well, what the court held and what was decided in that case was that the taking of the water by Virginia was not to the level where it would give rise to the kind of police concern that Maryland might express. The court left that issue open.",
  "It would be a valid exercise, but I was answering Mr. Chief Justice's question about what is left of it. And the question, what is left of it is that Virginia can continue to withdraw water from the Potomac River. Whether there should be a problem in the future about overwithdrawing or an exercise --",
  "It would -- it would be a limited carve out, that is correct.",
  "It is a limited carve out to the extent of permitting the wharfing out, Mr. Chief Justice. But that --",
  "If it is a nuisance you cannot get a license. That is classic riparian law, Mr. -- Justice --",
  "I'm saying yes. That would be a classic exercise of riparian --",
  "Let me try it this way. As a limitation of a riparian right, the State of Delaware can limit the length of the wharf, whether the wharf goes in ordinary circumstances, but as to a prohibition, it cannot do so unless it is a nuisance as a matter of riparian jurisdiction. As a matter of police power --",
  "No. The State can limit the activities that can occur on the wharf. And that is the crucial distinction here.",
  "That's correct.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Typically the Corps of Engineers determines that issue as a matter of application of the 1899 Rivers and Harbors Appropriations Act. Section 10 of that act, Justice Alito, the Corps of Engineers has the authority to determine whether or not a docking or wharfing in a navigable waterway of the United States would constitute a nuisance to --",
  "That's correct.",
  "The environmental laws would apply to the project. The position of Delaware is not that BP can't build its wharf. It's that it can't engage in a prohibited use on that wharf. The wharf itself is not a nuisance. It does not violate any normal standard of riparian use.",
  "As I matter of both States' laws, Justice Kennedy, that's not how either state does it. Both States now require as part of the environmental --",
  "I think that, yes, it could do that if its intent was to achieve access to the navigable waterway. But both states, both New Jersey, outside the Twelve-Mile Circle, and Delaware apply police powers now so that permits have to be required when --",
  "That is an easy one, Mr. Chief Justice, because New Jersey has conceded that it does not have the authority to regulate dredging within the Twelve Mile Circle.",
  "That's the point. Riparian jurisdiction is quite limited. It concerns only certain aspects of the riparian owner's access to the waterways, and that limitation of that property right has been recognized for centuries by this Court and others courts.",
  "That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. I'm using it in the term that the Special Master did it, which is the State's jurisdiction to govern the exercise of riparian rights. It is not a term of art. Farnham's treatise, which is another source of where riparian rights traditionally have been recognized, did not use that phrase, and the parties could not find any --",
  "It is a -- yes, it is a part of the classic riparian right, intakes and discharges, Justice Stevens.",
  "The police power would prevail on that, because what you dump is what -- is where everything matters. If the dumping is simply water that doesn't have any ecological effects, that --",
  "That would be subject to the environmental laws. That's classic police power recognized by this Court in Hudson v. McCarter.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to address both standing and the merits, but because there are some additional wrinkles on the standing question in light of how it was briefed in the reply brief, I'd like to make three brief points on the merits before addressing standing. First, the bank engaged in a seven-year business relationship with the Longs, knowing that they were Indians and deriving substantial commercial benefits from the Longs' tribal status through the BIA loan guarantees. Second, the bank has not challenged tribal court jurisdiction over the breach of contract claim or the bad faith claim, which are the core claims in the case.",
  "And I'll address that, Justice Ginsburg, on the general verdict point, which is there is actually some law of this which I would like to describe for the Court my understanding of. My third point, though, is that both the district court and the Eighth Circuit below found significant that the bank had conceded tribal court jurisdiction in its motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim, and they found that concession to be important to note, and both courts below found the Indian character of the Long family company to be notable as well. Under this Court's two court rule, those fact findings are entitled to significant respect. Now, as to the standing question Justice Ginsburg, let me get to your point on the general verdict. This is ultimately a question of tribal procedural law, how the tribal court would treat vacature of a claim deemed to be an invalid claim.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, under tribal law number 1, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe has adopted the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for procedure in the tribal courts, and under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 49, there are provisions for special verdicts and general verdicts, and Rule 49(a)(3) provides that if no specific objection is made to a fact or finding requested by the jury, it is waived. The bank here did not make a specific objection to the general interrogatory number 6, therefore, they may be deemed to have waived their objection to having the damages collected.",
  "That's my point, Mr. Chief Justice. In the trial transcript which is contained at roughly pages 555 through 562 of the tribal court record, there was colloquy on how these special interrogatories were to be framed. The bank objected to number 4, the discrimination count on the ground that a company cannot be discriminated against, only individuals can be discriminated against. That objection was sustained, and so special interrogatory 4 was written as you see it in the joint appendix. The bank did not object to the general verdict question on damages, so the law on Rule 49(a)(3) would be that special verdict is deemed to be waived, and now there is some - -",
  "Precisely so, Justice Scalia.",
  "The way cases say general verdicts should be deemed, if there is an invalid claim, there are competing views about what to do with that when the damages awarded is treated as a general verdict. There is a circuit split on the question of what you do when there has not been a specific objection preserved and there is a general verdict and one invalid claim and evidence that supports a valid claim. Now recall, they don't challenge the breach of contract claim. Our brief points out how the evidence supports damages for breach of contract. Now Judge Kozinski in the Ninth Circuit in a case called McCord v. Maguire 83 F 2d 1271 says that this waiver rule means that their ability to challenge the general verdict would be waived and they would be forced to live with the verdict if evidence supports it. Under that rule - -",
  "That's correct. That's correct. The First Circuit in a case called Gillespie versus Sears Roebuck, 386 F3d 21 takes the position that if you have not filed your objection you have not waived it.",
  "Chief Judge -- I was about to say that. They are both very fine opinions; they - -",
  "No. What I'm saying is that the tribal court, which would be looking to Federal law to resolve the effect of a supposed tainted claim -- if you were to conclude that a discrimination complaint is a tainted claim -- would have to evaluate what effect that has on the final judgment. And because there is a circuit conflict on that question, unfortunately, I cannot give you a definitive answer as to how the tribal court would resolve that. My point, though, is that if this Court concludes that there is a redressibility problem in this case, which we would submit, respectfully, there is, the appropriate course would be to vacate and remand for the lower courts to certify the question to the tribal court of appeals or to make some further inquiry into the law to determine how - -",
  "It is - -",
  "No. I've asked you to go with the Ninth Circuit Court because that is what I think is the court rule. But, Justice Scalia, any time a different jurisdiction incorporates some law into its own system, it is opining as a matter of Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe law. And, as Cohen's Indian law treatise points out, tribal courts would not look not only to Federal sources but also to State courts, too. The rule in South Dakota follows the general verdict rule in which - -",
  "That's correct although we have not been able to find precedent - -",
  "Well, there are published decisions. This Court -- this is a question of first impression.",
  "No. I think, Justice Scalia, the Court would look at the various sources of law - -",
  "Yes.",
  "I would like to beg the indulgence of the Court in not answering that question specifically.",
  "My point - -",
  "Well, to the contrary, Mr. Chief Justice. There is a State supreme court case on point called Pourier, which we cited in our brief, which says that a majority-owned corporation under South Dakota State law shall be treated as a member of that tribe for the tax purposes that were at issue in that case. So - -",
  "Well, I - -",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, let me step back and say I'm not here to advocate that there can be different racial characteristics of corporations. What is anomalous about this case and the way the BIA has set up this program is that the BIA establishes principles of Indian identity so that it can determine whether it satisfies congressional mandates for Indian financing.",
  "Banks typically do require lots of documentation, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "The difference here, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the bank required BIA loan guarantees as a condition of making the loans.",
  "They did not. They required more, and that's the important point. The facts actually matter.",
  "I would acknowledge that when there are no BIA loan guarantees required, a bank may or may not know of the identity of the owners of the corporation.",
  "Without further facts, no. Here, though, the bank required the BIA loan. It went on to the reservation to scrutinize the collateral. It required personal guarantees from the tribal members. It got collateral in guarantees on the personal effects and chattels. It knew that the corporation was doing all of its business on tribal trust lands. It went into the tribal headquarters to determine that the tribe was comfortable with the various loan arrangements. It enlisted the assistance of tribal financial officers to ensure that the cash flow would be a sufficient - -",
  "I think, in general, Mr. Chief Justice, I would agree with that hypothetical. But here, if you took away the BIA loan piece, I think the facts very strongly point to the bank knowing it was engaging in a consensual relationship with Indians because it went on tribal trust lands. It involves the officers of the tribe for effectuating the loan.",
  "Justice Alito I don't think I can improve on the language that's in Montana in its first exception, itself, which is that there are consensual relations that are licensing of commercial - -",
  "No. I think that the Strate case imposed a nexus requirement. I think the liability has to arise out of that consensual relationship, which it clearly does here.",
  "No. I don't think necessarily any loan. I think I answered Mr. Chief Justice's question to the effect that any kind of general loan of that nature would not necessarily give rise to - -",
  "Yes.",
  "No. I think, Justice Alito, that there are very fine gradations in the facts. And we are not asking for an articulation of a general rule of the kind of sweeping effect that the Petitioners are asking for. We are asking for a straightforward application of Montana 1 on facts here that developed over a substantial number of years.",
  "I don't think that necessarily would give rise to the kind of consensual relationship that Montana was speaking about.",
  "I think what's missing is the longevity of a relationship, the degree to which the cause of action arose out of the answering of that ad. I mean one of the features of - -",
  "Well, I think that the necessary concomitant of having tribes with their elements of sovereignty residing within States and within the United States is to have somewhat less bright-line features to some of these jurisdictional principles. Our submission here is that the facts - -",
  "Given the facts that are present in this case.",
  "Yes, it would although the court in National Farmers and in Iowa Mutual could have disposed of the case simply on a bright-line-rule basis but rejected that very notion.",
  "Yes. And -- and I don't think - -",
  "That's how I understood your - -",
  "Yes, that's how I understood Justice Kennedy's question. You know, and it is the same - -",
  "I think that, yes, it can be. I mean the -- I thought I heard the Petitioner acknowledge today that if the discrimination rule had been written down, that that would be perfectly fine to put everybody on notice. These principles of discrimination here are - -",
  "Well, my -- my mission here is that the bank did not avail itself of any of the procedures in Rule 12 to clarify the source of the law, to move to dismiss the discrimination claim, to move for summary judgment on the discrimination claim.",
  "Well, in this particular case, Your Honor, this bank has availed itself purposefully of tribal courts on at least 14 occasions. This would be the 15th case. These are set out in the tribe's brief, the amicus brief, footnotes 27, 28, and 29.",
  "This is not a stranger to the tribal court, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "My point is - -",
  "No, I'm saying that the availment of the tribal court is what creates the jurisdiction. I'm saying it responds to the point that the bank can hardly claim surprise. They know how to deal with tribal law and tribal procedures. They could have asked the nonmember judge who presided over this trial to clarify how the discrimination would be done. In the tribal transcript, the colloquy on discrimination was rather straightforward as to treating members in a fair way as compared to treating nonmembers. These are not difficult concepts in the law.",
  "I have two suggested responses to that, Justice Ginsburg. One is that, when a tribal court judgment needs to be enforced, it can be brought in State court, and South Dakota follows the comity rule, which means that it has to satisfy certain requirements of fairness, adherence to basic principles, and the law before a State -- the State court will enforce the tribal court judgment. Under national - -",
  "That's correct. It's not full faith and credit; it's comity. And that comity provides for a substantive review while enforcing the judgment.",
  "The way the South Dakota statute is worded, Mr. Chief Justice, unfortunately, I can't give you a direct answer to that because it involves a panoply of issues whether State law deems the final judgment ultimately to be a fair one and -- and, importantly, when this Court recognized the jurisdictional point as giving rise to Federal jurisdiction in National Farmers, I would submit it also perhaps created the avenue for the enforcement of judgments to be brought in Federal court as well. I don't understand why a jurisdictional challenge and a challenge to the enforcement of a judgment could not give rise to the same Federal question jurisdiction recognized in National Farmers. So I think there are two avenues to be in State or Federal court when enforcing a judgment in tribal court that heretofore for have not fully been explored, certainly not by any decisions of this Court. If the Court has no further questions.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: When Congress enacted the Labeling Act, the 1969 Labeling Act, it gave no intention whatsoever to immunize cigarette makers for the false statements that they made in violation of anti-deception in the marketplace rules. They didn't empower the FTC with any special rulemaking authority that applied industrywide, and in fact the FTC's enforcement authority with respect to individual companies was quite limited. The argument that Philip - -",
  "That would be implied conflict pre-emption, and we would acknowledge that would be pre-empted. The difference here - -",
  "The difference here is that between a generally applicable rule that is specially targeted at the cigarette industry and a generally applicable rule against deception, upon which a fact finder would not need to make any special inquiry about smoking and health.",
  "Well, I have three responses, Mr. Chief Justice. The first is that the text in Riegel was different; the purposes behind what Congress enacted in the medical device amendments were different; and third, this Court twice, in both Reilly and in Cipollone, has looked at this exact statute and come to the opposite conclusion. First with respect to the text of the medical device amendments, there are several provisions of that act that are quite a bit broader than what the 1969 Labeling Act - -",
  "And the result, Mr. Chief Justice, of virtually every one of this Court's pre-emption cases has been to look at the particular words of the statute to determine the scope of the pre-emption. The Court did that in Bates. It did that in Morales. It did - -",
  "No.",
  "I do acknowledge that, Mr. Chief Justice. But my point is that in the medical device amendments what Congress was getting at were things that were quite a bit broader and it had sweeping language. It said not only to establish but also to continue in effect, with respect to a device, which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device, or \"to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device.\" By contrast - -",
  "No, I think you're quoting 1334(a) and the pre-emption provision at issue here, Mr. Chief Justice, is 1334(b) which says - -",
  "Well, no, it isn't, because the modifying term that's at issue in this case comes between the two points that you quoted, and that's the phrase \"based on smoking and health.\" Our contention here is that a generalized duty not to deceive is not a requirement based on smoking and health. It's based on a duty not to deceive.",
  "No, you don't. You have to look at two products and determine whether or not they are achieving the same yield of tar and nicotine that - -",
  "And the word \"relate\" does not appear in 1334(b), and that is crucial because this Court in Safeco v. Burr defined the phrase \"based upon\" to mean but-for causation: But for smoking and health, is there a requirement? The words \"related to\" have been defined by this Court in numerous pre-emption cases, including Morales, Wolens, ERISA cases, to be among the most sweeping language that Congress can use to denote a connection.",
  "Well, the damages here, Mr. Justice Kennedy, are -- concern getting two products that are not different. It's just like going to a car dealer and saying, I want a Ford and they - -",
  "I think we would accept that, Justice Kennedy.",
  "In fact in our case we are not proving health-related damages.",
  "No, we are not asking for injunctive relief. We are asking damages for the difference in value between a product we thought we were buying and a product we actually bought.",
  "I don't think so, Justice Souter. I think all we have to prove is that the products were different and that we relied materially on a misrepresentation about what product to use.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, I do, because our damages here, Justice Souter - -",
  "If we bought a product thinking that it would be a safer product and it was not, and we would have quit smoking.",
  "We're -- yes, we do, because the product is different. If you buy a car thinking it's a Ford and it's a Yugo but it still drives, you still have a claim under the lemon laws for deceptive advertising.",
  "That is an economic proof - -",
  "There is economic evidence, Justice Scalia, of a difference in value, and of course the pre-emption -- the issue here is not - -",
  "They did not charge more for light cigarettes.",
  "Economists have projected that if a person would have quit smoking and, therefore, not purchased light cigarettes or would have paid a different amount of money thinking it was getting a safer cigarette, there is an economic value - -",
  "Certainly. And the point here about the advertising - -",
  "Justice Souter, I don't think that the liability requirement here, the rule of law that is being imposed under Bates -- what Bates said was that you look at the elements of the claim to determine whether or not the requirements are imposed by State law. The requirement that we seek to impose here is the duty not to deceive - -",
  "We are not making the same argument here for two reasons: One is that the main statute is not specially targeted at cigarette smoking. It's specially targeted at deception in the marketplace. Under your hypothetical it would be specially targeted at cigarette companies. Under Reilly that would be preempted. Secondly, skull and crossbones I think - -",
  "The statute we seek to invoke is a - -",
  "Because the statute - -",
  "You looked at it because the statute required you to look at it as applicable, and the purposes behind that Act were to give the FDA authority at the premarketing -- and purposes behind the medical device amendment were completely different. The FTC does not look at these marketing materials before the cigarette companies do that.",
  "Prior to the enactment of the 1969 Labeling Act, Congress confronted the spectra of states imposing warning requirements. And the tobacco companies went to Congress and said, we do not want special burdens imposed on us. We don't want special advantages, but please don't impose special burdens on the cigarette industry. And Congress said, we will wipe away the prospect of state imposing warnings by having a congressionally mandated warning on the cigarette packs and in cigarette advertising. The Congress said nothing about having anti-deception laws be displaced by States. So that in, in the hair hypo that you gave, I think Mr. Olson would have to acknowledge that the cigarette companies were not asking at the time of the '69 Labeling Act to be free of anti-deception laws. They had been out for decades saying cigarette smoking cures the common cold, it makes the throat feel better, all sorts of health-related claims that were deceptive. And Congress was not trying to wipe that away.",
  "We are not here seeking injunctive relief for this - -",
  "I misspoke, Mr. Chief Justice, with apologies to the Court. Our claim here, though, principally is for damages. And I would also point out that any injunction that would have been ordered here would be superseded by the United States RICO case, where the District Court of the District of Columbia has already issued an injunction for the use of light cigarettes because Judge Kessler found in more than 4,000 findings of fact that Philip Morris had engaged in deception in the marketplace and findings of fact, beginning 2023 and following - -",
  "The consent decree in the master settlement agreement does not address itself to specific issues with regard to light and low tar, to my knowledge. The Kessler order does address the deception by lights and low tar, and the reason is temporal. When the master settlement agreement was entered into in the late '90s, the tobacco companies had not yet acknowledged publicly that they had been engaged in deception with respect to studies regarding low tar and light cigarette. That came to light in 2002, and as a result of the discovery that occurred in the government's case and in State cases, the studies that the cigarette companies knew for decades that there was no difference in the yield for low tar and light cigarettes came to light. And so, the master settlement agreement was not -- it had certain provisions about the way cigarettes could be marketed but -- but the Judge Kessler opinion, in the government's RICO case, actually makes findings of fact on this score. And the complaint here essentially tracks the allegations in the government's. All we seek to do is to provide a remedy to consumers that have been defrauded by Philip Morris over these many decades.",
  "I think that would fall into the Reilly line of being preempted, because it would be specially targeted and there would be no room for a cigarette maker to say truthfully our product actually does yield lower and light. So, it could not be a requirement based on deception. It would have to be a requirement based on smoking and health under your hypothetical.",
  "Yes, they were. Those - - the fraudulent neutralization of warning claim and the failure to warn claim were common law claims, Justice Alito, but the difference here is that in Cipollone the plurality plus the three Justices who joined Justice Blackmun's opinion and would have found no common law claims preempted. Seven Justices found fraud claims that are virtually identical to ours not to be preempted because Congress lacked any intent to displace State laws concerning deception.",
  "The requirement is what I would urge you to focus on, Justice Kennedy. And the requirement that is being imposed here is not a requirement that has to do specifically with smoking and health. There is a second argument, which is that even under the application of that generalized duty, the jury here or the trial court would not be asked to look at the linkage between smoking and health. It could simply say, have a scientist up there who says the yield of a light cigarette is no different than the yield of a regular cigarette.",
  "That's correct. That was the general purpose of the statute. There is language, of course, that - -",
  "That's absolutely correct, Justice Stevens. And here what we are talking about with these light descriptors are comparisons between two products that, in fact, are not different.",
  "Well, the attorney general could bring the same suit that we bring here, Justice Kennedy. The difference is between a - -",
  "And let me answer the hypothetical this way: The attorney general can bring the lawsuit under the State deceptive practices act but cannot issue a generalized regulation targeted at the cigarette industry that takes truth completely out of the equation, because if another cigarette company comes up and says, \"We actually have a light cigarette that is lower in tar,\" and we can prove it - -",
  "I think that's a much more difficult hypo, but I think the answer is the same and that would be no, because a regulation would be -- would be specifically targeted at the industry and it would be based on smoking and health, not deception. In an injunctive situation, adjudicatory facts can evolve. A company can come forward and say the facts have changed, circumstances have changed, please modify the injunction. That can't happen when a generalized regulation is imposed that is specifically targeted at facts regardless of their truth or veracity.",
  "If the -- if the company came forward and said, \"we redesigned our cigarette,\" and it in fact does yield less tar and nicotine under a scientifically verifiable test, that would be -- that would run afoul of the regulation, but it would not run afoul of the general duty not to deceive.",
  "Thank you. Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to start with regulation 201.80, which is set forth in an addendum to our brief at 19-A. The second sentence of which reads: \"The labeling shall be revised -- this is after an applicant, a sponsor has obtained approval of the drug label -- \"it shall be revised to include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious risk with a drug. A causal relationship need not have been proved.\" The testimony at trial established that Wyeth knew or should have known from at least the '70s that there was a significance issue concerning IV push risks. And, Justice Alito, in answer to your question - -",
  "FDA never considered any comparative risks of IV push versus IV drip. The evidence on this was clear. Wyeth had a - -",
  "What the evidence showed was that FDA certainly was aware that there are different forms of intravenous administration of drugs, but it never considered that the risk of IV push so greatly increased the risks of a catastrophic injury - -",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, here there was no way FDA could have made this determination because the risks of IV push are so catastrophic compared to the benefit which the testimony at trial showed - -",
  "No.",
  "The testimony at trial showed that the doctor acted with a standard of care that was not negligent, and that was based on expert testimony.",
  "And the testimony at trial showed that that had no bearing on her injury, because - -",
  "Yes. It did. The testimony at trial from Dr. Green disputed that point. Both courts below rejected that notion. But the idea that a label is set in stone for all time misunderstands the way the process works. When FDA approves a drug with a drug label, it does so on the basis of small clinical trials with very few, sometimes as few as a thousand or a couple of thousand people. And when the drug is marketed and goes to lots and lots of people that are not healthy, that are in different conditions, new problems arise. That's why the general -- the GAO found that over 51 percent of drugs have adverse drug events not known.",
  "That was not our burden and that was not how the testimony came in at trial. But as the amicus brief by Dr. Budhwani, et al. at pages 54 establishes had Wyeth been a reasonably prudent manufacturer over the years, it would have known that the risks of IV push so far outweigh any bearing negligible benefits, that it would have offered a stronger instruction, it would have moved to revise its label either with FDA approval or - -",
  "Footnote one of the Vermont Supreme Court's opinion disputes that point, because it says the label was different. And if you compare what was submitted to FDA versus what FDA looked at, there was no reference to IV push risks creating the risk of catastrophic harm versus negligible, Justice Scalia.",
  "Well, as the jury was instructed, Mr. Chief Justice, and the evidence came in at trial, it was -- it was somewhat larger than that in the sense that a State failure to warn claim doesn't prescribe particular wording. It simply says that the existing wording is inadequate. And if the case comes to this Court - -",
  "But the label itself is not set in stone, Mr. Chief Justice. Manufacturers change their labels all the time as new drug risks come in. And the regulations provide that the manufacturer is responsible not only for the label, but for monitoring post-market information.",
  "No. It's not dependent on that at all, Mr. Chief Justice. It is dependent on a finding that the manufacturer had a duty of due care and it didn't live up to that.",
  "The testimony - -",
  "The question is what does the manufacturer know and when did this manufacturer know it? And here, the testimony at trial showed that an antinausea drug called Vistrol -- this is at page 79 of the joint appendix -- caused amputations in two cases. Pfizer voluntarily removed IV push injection for that drug. This was information in Wyeth's files; Wyeth knew this from the 1970s; and yet it did nothing to change the Phenergan label.",
  "Well, the FDA itself said in the Solicitor General's brief at page 25 that it was deemed to be a nonsubstantive change. These were changes that were being made - -",
  "It was a different label and it was a different strength of warning, but it didn't have to do with the relative risks and benefits of IV push versus IV drip.",
  "That was the crucial point.",
  "This is set out at footnote 1 of the Vermont Supreme Court opinion, which is set out in the joint -- in the petition appendix at pages 4a to 5a, and it goes on for two pages. But essentially what the -- what the comparison was was talking about the preferability of injecting it through the tubing of an intravenous infusion set that is known to be functioning satisfactorily, which would suggest to most medical practitioners and was it the case in the trial testimony given by Dr. Green below, that that would suggest an IV drip, not IV push. When FDA then rejected it for -- for nonsubstantive reasons, it went back to the prior verbiage which is set out at 5a, which simply says if you put this drug in an artery the concentration can be such that it will -- it will cause harm. But our point is that these kinds of risks come to light frequently with drugs that are on the market and the need to revise these labels is the duty of the manufacturer. Section 314. - -",
  "Well, how you - -",
  "I think that the dispute is -- is what constitutes new information, because we don't take issue with the notion that new information can be new analysis of prior submitted data; and what the amicus brief by Dr. Budhwani et al. Points out is that there was a lot of unpublished information about the harms of Phenergan that was known to Wyeth or should have been known to Wyeth in the '80s and '90s that would have justified a change under the CEE regulations.",
  "That be pre-empted. And the reason it would be pre-empted is because the FDA would have considered and rejected on the basis of the same information or similar information the very duty that underlies the State claim.",
  "No, it's -- well, it is not -- I think there are two things to keep analytically clear. One is can the manufacturer come forward with a label change on the basis of -- of information that is assessing the risk or reassessing the risk, and under the -- under the regulations it's absolutely clear it can do that before FDA has approved it. It is subject to FDA disapproval.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Justice Scalia, that would promote public safety, because it puts into the hands of doctors the information that enables them to make individualized risk determinations.",
  "And Congress said - -",
  "No, and in fact that's contrary to the policy determination Congress made. In the misbranding provision, which is Section 352(f), it calls -- that the label is misbranded unless its labeling bears adequate directions for use and such adequate warnings against use in those pathological conditions or by children where its use may be dangerous to health or against unsafe dosage or methods or duration of administration or application.",
  "Yes. It's misbranded. And in the 1979 - -",
  "It -- it provides you a basis for marketing your --- your product.",
  "In -- the FDA itself said so in 1979 in 44 Federal Register, which we cite in our brief, that even an original label may be misbranded if the drug manufacturer subsequently learns that it was not adequate for the safe use of the drug.",
  "No, it's - -",
  "No. What I'm saying is that the information developed after the original label is approved, and it is not a floor and a ceiling - -",
  "And that's - -",
  "Our position is that the duty is on the manufacturer to make a safe label, and if the label is - -",
  "That's fair, but let me just make clear that our test would require the FDA to consider and reject the specific basis on which the State law - -",
  "I'm not going to retract that, Justice Scalia.",
  "The basis -- the basis of the FDA's approval is on the basis of limited information, which Congress has said for public safety reasons -- we are not doing a balancing here; we are doing this for public safety - - And if the label is not adequate for public safety it is a misbranded drug.",
  "I -- I think there is pre-emption, but that does not mean - -",
  "Maybe there is no - -",
  "Let me try to untangle it this way. The fact that there is pre-emption and you cannot bring as State law failure-to-warn claim doesn't mean that the drug isn't misbranded under the Federal standard the FDA - -",
  "Well, if - -",
  "That's correct. The -- the point - -",
  "In that very hypothetical, yes.",
  "But the point is that the failure is that the failure-to-warn claim tracks the misbranding provision; and if you look at the jury instructions in this case, the wording is very close to the wording of the misbranding provision in terms of the adequacy of the warning that must be provided.",
  "All State law is doing is providing a remedy that is absent from Federal law.",
  "The fact is there was no consideration and rejection of a stronger IV push warning. There was no consideration by the FDA of IV push as a means of administration distinct from other intravenous forms that would lead to a different kind of risk-benefit balancing. So with the -- in the case where there would be pre-emption, FDA would be asked, we -- we want to put a stronger warning as against this -- FDA says: We don't think there is scientific evidence. Do not put that warning on the label.",
  "And the Vermont Supreme Court was quite emphatic about this, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "And you search in the joint appendix in vain for communications between Wyeth and FDA communicating about the particular risks of IV push.",
  "I will acknowledge that the references in some instances suggest IV push. There is no doubt that the FDA knew that IV push was a method of intravenous administration, but our point is a starker one, and that is that the FDA never was put to the test of deciding comparative risks and benefits of IV push versus IV drip. And it's that point that is crucial, because the catastrophic risks of IV push are so dramatic, no reasonable person could have made a safety determination to allow this drug with its risks when there are corresponding benefits that create exactly the same kind of treatment of care for the patient.",
  "It's two things: One, they didn't consider it and that's clearly - -",
  "Second,",
  "There are communications that went back and forth between the company. These are set out in the joint appendix. They make no reference to IV push risks as distinct from - -",
  "The original application actually is not known. It wasn't in Wyeth's files. This drug was approved in 1955. We don't know where the original label was, Justice Souter.",
  "That's correct. And - -",
  "It does not, Justice Scalia. The label says -- it's talking about intravenous administration. It does not distinguish between IV drip and IV push. And Dr. Matthew testified at trial that, based on the label, he would not have been able to make a treatment determination to distinguish between the two, and that had he had that information, he clearly would have given this drug to Diana Levine through the intravenous drip method. The label simply didn't - -",
  "Yes, I think it can be sustained on the basis of - -",
  "I don't think that the Vermont Supreme Court's opinion totally, because it does go into the area that you're talking about, Justice Kennedy, but if I could refer the Court to trial record testimony, which is set out in the joint appendix and more elaborately in the trial record itself, which makes clear that Wyeth knew or should have known about these comparative risks. It should have had a basis for changing its label or proposing to FDA a different label, and that would be sufficient to satisfy the Federal standards as well as the State duty of due care. And we think the judgment on that basis could be sustained.",
  "I think it probably arose in the early '70s when a -- when there was a published - - or there was an incident - -",
  "A strong argument can be made that it would have been before the 1970s application when they were reformatting. These are old drugs. We don't have evidence from the 1950s that would have suggested that the original label determination in 1955 would have caused a difference but certainly by the 1970s when -- when Wyeth was reformatting this as an old drug to comply with new standards, it should have known and it certainly should have known by the 1990s when several amputations had occurred from IV push Phenergan, which were in Wyeth's files. The people who analyzed these records, you know, were emphatic that Wyeth knew or should have known by the 1990s. And that was clear by the testimony of experts that -- that showed the comparison between Vistrol and Phenergan and on the basis of the IV push injuries that had occurred that were nonpublished. They appeared to have been reported to FDA, but Wyeth never took the trouble to do the synthesis, to connect the dots between these very terrible tragedies that had occurred from its drug, to bring about a labeling change or a modification that would have saved lives. And that is a failure on the part of the manufacturer not to comply with its standards of due care and with the regulations which require health risk information to be the basis of modifications to the labeling.",
  "Well, by \"original approval,\" do you mean 1955 or do you mean in 1998 and 2000?",
  "It would be on the basis, I think, of both. I think we would be able to establish that there was a justification on the basis of information before the reformatted labeling took place, and that was testimony by Dr. Green at trial on the basis of Vistrol, the other amputation that had occurred with Phenergan in 1965. And the -- the important point here is that on the basis of new information, if you are going to conclude that there is a standard that has to be met, I would urge you to consider two things: One is that the burden of showing absence of new information is going to fall on the manufacturer because it is asserting a pre-emption defense, but the way pre-emption gets argued in the courts, it is done oftentimes before discovery is permitted. So, if there is information in the drug manufacturer's files that would be relevant to a determination of the breach of duty by the drug manufacturer, if you decide pre-emption has to be done before discovery can be done, there would be no way to get that information.",
  "Well, let me -- let me address that question because your question goes to the regulatory compliance defense and that is not a pre-emption defense. It is a defense based on State law that the manufacturer in fact was not negligent because it complied with the applicable regulations. In that - - under that scenario, Justice Kennedy, the plaintiff is going to be able to obtain discovery and make arguments to the trial court about whether or not that compliance negated or did not negate negligence. But pre-emption is a Federal defense that would be asserted typically at the outset of the lawsuit before information is obtained. And notably, before 2000, FDA did not have subpoena power of drug manufacturers. It did not have the power to force labeling changes. It didn't even have the power to force drug manufacturers to make post-marketing studies.",
  "I'm not totally, Justice Breyer, I confess, but let me try to address it this way.",
  "You are absolutely right about that.",
  "I think the duty is always going to be on the manufacturer, Justice Breyer. The regulations at 314.80(b) establish that the -- that the manufacturer has the responsibility to do post - marketing analysis and post-marketing surveys to determine the continuing safety of its drugs. If the manufacturer doesn't do that, it isn't complying with the Federal regulations which have an ongoing duty on them. And so in the case where there is silence, I would respectfully submit the manufacturer is not complying with its regulatory duty to ensure that there is current information about all of the side- effect risks of its drugs. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Second Circuit's judgment should be affirmed for three reasons. First, a collective bargaining agreement gives the union exclusive control over workers' grievances. Second, unions have inherent conflicts of interest with respect to individual statutory anti-discrimination rights; and third, unions lack authority to serve as gatekeepers of individual workers' substantive ADEA rights. With respect to the first point, a collective bargaining agreement generally gives the union exclusive control over whether to bring grievances on behalf of workers and how such grievances are pursued. In such circumstances -- which is this case, the workers have not advanced the requisite agreement to arbitrate, and control over the arbitral forum to satisfy this Court's standards in Gilmer for effectively vindicating the workers' statutory anti-discrimination rights.",
  "Justice Alito, I've looked comprehensively through the cases. We've never found a collective bargaining agreement that gives the kind of interpretation that Mr. Salvatore offered in this case. Now, is it theoretically possible that a collective bargaining agreement would confer on individuals the rights this Court said in Gilmer are necessary to vindicate that? I would acknowledge it's theoretically possible, but it has to be done within the confines of whether there is actual consent by the individual to the arbitration, whether the individual has control over the mechanisms of arbitration, and whether or not the structure of the arbitral forum effectively vindicates the individual's substantive rights.",
  "Nothing except this Court's case in Magnavox where the Court said that the union may not bargain away an individual's rights where there would be a conflict between the union's interests and the individual's. Here, because this is a discrimination claim, unions are often brought as defendants in such claims, particularly in circumstances as here, where the union agreed to the conditions that gave rise to the discrimination on the basis of age by these workers.",
  "That -- that's correct. And that's why I think the Gilmer point is -- is essential here, Justice Souter and Justice Alito. Because in Gilmer there was individual consent; there needs to be such individual consent under the ADEA waiver itself, and knowing and individual waiver is necessary before the person can waive the substantive ADEA rights. That would need to be part of the hypothetical collective bargaining agreement that I was positing with Justice Alito.",
  "I think that would follow, as that would be a condition of employment that could not be imposed. The airline - -",
  "That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but there are two different points at which the condition of employment arose. I understood the questions on this side to be after the agreement had taken place and the worker was already on the work site. Under your hypothetical, if an employee gains entrance to the work force and is asked, \"will you sign this,\" there is individual consent in that circumstance. That is the fact situation in the Air Line Pilots case.",
  "That's -- that's how we read this Court's statutory - -",
  "Sorry. With an ordinary - -",

  "Well, the union is not going to be the Defendant typically in a tort case where the employer is responsible.",
  "It refers to discrimination, and as we cite on page 27 of our brief, there are provisions in the anti-discrimination laws that are specifically directed at union discrimination. The legislative history of these statutes indicates that discrimination by unions was one of the concerns animating Congress - -",

  "And that's why - -",
  "I think, Justice Breyer, that the discrimination cases do stand in a different category because of the inherent conflict of the - -",
  "I don't think Congress - -",
  "Well, no, because there are two other reasons: The exclusive control over the machinery and the union serving as the gatekeeper. I'm not aware of tort suits being subjects of collective bargaining, Justice Breyer. Nor am I aware of cases in which the unions have given up individuals' tort claims in situations, principally because unions are not the persons against whom such tort suits are brought.",
  "Yes, you would, but the principles this Court has applied in looking at that broad line, I'm trying to suggest that there might be situations in which those principles, where the union is serving as the gatekeeper, thereby not allowing a person to vindicate his individual rights in the tort context, to be not - -",
  "And the answer is no. I thought - -",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, I think that your question really is getting at the theory behind collective bargaining agreements and what extent the union can exercise control over the individual rights and circumstances of employment. That question is a very complex question over which many, many - -",
  "I -- well, I think that there are limits, of course, on the union's authority that have been recognized in this Court's decisions, and I don't think that ruling in the workers' favor in this circumstance opens up any kind of Pandora's box at all, because all we are arguing for is that the Gardner-Denver line, which was written by this Court unanimously more 30 years ago, continue to be the law of the land, as the Court has reaffirmed - -",
  "I -- I think that is a harder case, Justice Alito, but I think that the answer under this Court's decisions in Gardner-Denver points the way here, in footnote 19 of the decision. Where the union controls that process and where the union is a potential defendant in that circumstance, the workers' individual rights cannot be subordinated - -",
  "-- to the union's control.",
  "Yes, and I think that there have been conditions of employment and discharge that have been arbitrable, and I don't see that there is a - - an issue there where -- except where that intersection with the statutory discrimination rights occurs. And Congress has made a different policy judgment with respect to individual waivers of such rights in - -",
  "Well, I'm not sure actually in answering your hypothetical that they would necessarily have to go through the union on the nonpayment because of the Fair Labor Standards Act case. This Court in Barrentine said that, where an FSLA claim is at issue, the worker does not -- is not confined or precluded after arbitrating at the union grievance process from bringing an FLSA suit in court. So I want to reserve, accepting all of your hypothetical, Justice Scalia, but in further answer to the point, I think it's important to keep in mind that in the discrimination context, you're talking about more than just money. Here my clients are older workers who are forced into more physically strenuous positions that they had gotten away from by virtue of their growth in seniority at the building.",
  "Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice, but where Congress has made a choice that individual claims for individual anti-discrimination rights need to be vindicated in particular ways, and where this Court's - -",
  "Certainly, but there is individual consent in that circumstance. I would like to make a couple of other points before closing. One is that on pages 4 to 5 in the brief in opposition to cert we specifically raise the issue that the union controls the arbitration, and there is no opportunity for individual arbitration under this collective bargaining agreement. There is nothing in the provision set out in the petition appendix that gives individual rights, the individuals the right to arbitrate under this collective bargaining agreement. The payment provision calls for 50 percent by the employer and 50 percent by the employee with the employer having the sole right to terminate the arbitrator for any or no reason at all.",
  "Well - -",
  "Certainly, the interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement is fairly included within the question presented. And as this Court found in Wright in a situation where it granted certiorari on the very same question here but then looked at the specific provisions of the collective bargaining agreement to determine that, in fact, under the facts there a different rule applied for a clear and unambiguous waiver. All we are saying here is that under this provision there is no opportunity for the individual to arbitrate, and that raises a -- a problem analogous to the one that is in Wright. We think that is fairly included within the question presented, and that the Court can affirm on that basis, certainly where the Second Circuit had relied on precedent that said that where the individual doesn't have a right, that it is union control of arbitration. That is consistent with Gardner-Denver.",
  "Well, I think that - -",
  "My only point is that this is one of these fuzzy areas where we are not making independent, alternate ground of affirmance. I think our argument is fairly included within the question presented and can be affirmed on the basis of that argument. If the court has no further questions - -",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I guess I would answer that question by saying we will pay our money and take our chances in the sense that the unions here are supporting the workers where the unions are acknowledging that there is this kind of conflict of interest, and the question of whether or not imposing arbitration on the individual workers would be a condition of employment. That is a question that you can safely leave for another day.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, in fact, empirically that is not correct. There is a study that is cited in a footnote in one of the amicus briefs that arbitration is more expensive than bringing civil litigation. And it is because the -- under -- under their provision if you pay 50 percent of the arbitrator's costs, you can run up quite a big tab that you would not have to pay - -",
  "Well, under your scenario, I think where the employer would control the arbitral process, the arbitrator knows who is buttering his bread.",
  "And -- and that has been the law for 30 years, and we think it should continue to be the law, Mr. Chief Justice. If the marketplace is going to help weed out those claims, that's certainly the province of lawyers taking these cases and clients deciding whether or not to tell everybody to - -",
  "Certainly - -",
  "That's why this Court has always said that individual consent and agreement is a fundamental precept of arbitration. Where that agreement is absent, a worker should not be forced. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: South Carolina seeks an equitable apportionment with North Carolina of the Catawba River. Both States act as parens patriae on behalf of all users of the river within their boundaries. For three reasons, this Court should not adopt the Special Master's recommendation that Charlotte, Duke, and the Catawba River Water Supply Project be permitted to intervene as parties in this original action: First, the report articulates the wrong legal test for intervention. Second, under the New Jersey v. New York standard, none of the three entities should be permitted to intervene. And, third, the report's approach to intervention involves this Court in deciding intramural disputes between and among water users in one State. With respect to the first point, the Special Master applied the wrong factors, we would submit, in deciding whether or not a party or an intervenor should be allowed to intervene as a party. The Special Master sought to distill from this Court's cases three principles that we would submit are not the appropriate principles in deciding an intervenor's status. First, the report overemphasizes the, quote, \"direct stake,\" although the master found that the equitable apportionment had no specific impact on individual users of the water.",
  "Your Honor, part of what you will be deciding in this case is the appropriate standard for intervention, and the Special Master, we respectfully submit, did not apply the New Jersey v. New York factors. Instead, the report distilled from other cases, not the New Jersey v. New York case, the principles that she thought should apply to govern an intervenor's status, and those three principles, we would submit, are incorrect. Under the New Jersey v. New York standard, the master did not make findings that would be appropriate to determine the intervenor status here as appropriate parties. There was no finding of inadequate representation by either State to support any of the intervenor’s request to participate as parties. There was no finding of a compelling interest in the sense that it was truly compelling. It's hard to argue in cases in -- where there is no case from this Court in the equitable apportionment area that three intervenors would have met the compelling interest standard here. And, finally, the New York-New Jersey standard talks about having interests that are apart from other interests. But both Charlotte and the Catawba River Water Supply Project are simply acting on behalf of all users of North Carolina water. They simply happen to be the largest ones.",
  "First, the interests were different. They were not an equitable apportionment where the water --",
  "This Court has said for 200 years that water is a unique resource within the sovereign control of States. In the Maryland case, the Court permitted intervention in a situation in which Louisiana had sued the pipeline companies in Louisiana State court for a declaratory judgment that its tax was constitutional. There was also a pending FERC action in Federal court in Louisiana raising the same issue, so when Maryland and eight other States who were not parens patriae of the various pipeline companies who sought to intervene filed the original action, I think the Court appropriately considered that interests of judicial efficiency called for handling the Commerce Clause challenge in the original action in this case. And finally, the Court only devoted two sentences of its opinion and didn't cite the New Jersey v. -- New York v. New Jersey case in acting on the intervention.",
  "I don't think I can recall a case in that factual scenario, but I can point you to Kentucky v. Indiana in 1930, in which this Court rejected Kentucky's attempt to join individual Indiana citizens as parties in an original action over Indiana's alleged breach of a contract to build an interstate bridge. And the reason --",
  "No, in fact, Mr. Chief Justice, I would submit they have the weakest claim to intervention in this case. Their argument, fundamentally, is that Union County, North Carolina, which is the North Carolina part of the joint venture with the Lancaster Water District, should be permitted to have water purchased from the South Carolina side of the boundary. So what's happening with that water project is the water is sucked out on the South Carolina side and piped north for Union County's consumption under a Union County permit with the State of North Carolina. Union County, therefore, is acting as any other user of water, along with Charlotte and all other users of water in North Carolina. The Catawba Project is not here to intervene to protect its interests on the South Carolina side of the boundary. Those are adequately protected, we submit, by the attorney general acting on behalf of the State. So in effect the Union County, North Carolina, claim here of 5 million gallons of water per day which they are seeking to protect through their intervention is no different than the other interests of North Carolina water users that they are seeking to protect --",
  "The dispute is about the transfer of water and consumption of water in toto. The Court --",
  "The focus of the complaint highlights interbasin transfers to the extent that they are a large quantifiable amount of water being taken out of the Catawba River, that we submit should not be counted on --",
  "No.",
  "Because in an equitable apportionment case, this Court decides which share of the water is allocable to each State. It is a question of State law how each State shall determine the intrastate allocations of the water. So --",
  "We take the real world, Your Honor, as this Court's cases direct us, and those cases tell us that in situations where the Court is deciding an equitable apportionment between two States -- water, of course, is fungible. It's a series of molecules that do not accord property rights in any one entity or user. They all divine from the State itself. So if North Carolina, in its exercise of parens patriae responsibility, determines that Charlotte should have a larger share than what it currently has, that's a decision for Charlotte -- for North Carolina as a political entity to decide among its users. It does not necessarily implicate this Court's action in an equitable apportionment to say that what the Court will ultimately decide is what Charlotte's share is. That is not what we are seeking, and that's not what an injunction from this Court equitably apportioning the Catawba River would necessarily decide.",
  "No, for several reasons, Justice Ginsburg. First, in any appellate review Situation, this Court would review de novo the legal test that would be applied. Our initial submission is the master applied and articulated the wrong legal test. So you would first need to determine, we would submit, what is the correct legal test for submission. That is a de novo review standard. But secondly, the Court has said in numerous original cases it does not apply deference, although it gives appropriate respect to special masters, and so there would be no basis for applying a deference standard to a special master ruling on a question of law that fundamentally is about what this Court's original jurisdiction under Article III is supposed to be about.",
  "Well, virtually every case, Justice Scalia --",
  "Maryland v. Louisiana.",
  "There was actually no special master recommendation in that case. The Court decided it on its motion directly to this Court. Virtually all of the cases that we cited in the blue brief highlight the fact that special masters routinely reject motions to intervene. It is the rare situation in which a special master would allow intervention. And the only example that the other side can come up with is the Nebraska v. Wyoming case, in which finally Basin Electric, after 10 years of participating in the original action as an amicus, was allowed to intervene because the Special Master viewed there to be tension between the State of Nebraska's interest and that that Basin Electric was seeking to vindicate. You --",
  "And the case that it cited is Oklahoma v. Texas, which is a very unusual case from this Court's docket in the 1920s. What the Court decided in 1932, Justice Ginsburg, in the Wyoming and Colorado case was that in situations involving interstate allocations of water, the claimants or users of a State are deemed to be represented by the State. The case on which the Court relied in the Maryland case was back into an old era in which it was unclear whether States acting as parens patriae had the responsibility to act on behalf of all claimants or users of water. The Maryland case, as I said before, did not analyze the New Jersey v. New York factors, and I would submit that in light of the other circumstances of the case, the fact that it was a Commerce Clause challenge involving Federal, State, and private companies, in which there was multiple litigation pending in various forums, it was an exercise of the Court's decision to efficiently decide the Commerce Clause challenge to allow those pipeline companies in, where some of those pipeline companies were not represented by States that were parties in the case.",
  "Well, I -- I will -- I obviously forgot about footnote 21 of the Court's opinion in Maryland v. Louisiana, Justice Ginsburg. But I think --",
  "Well, let's start with the original jurisdiction principle. Those are actions that are brought invoking this Court's original jurisdiction, which this Court could sit without a special master and would decide the matter as it sits as a court of nine. The fact that it appoints a special master to assist and facilitate that effort does not imbue the actions of that person delegated that responsibility with something akin to the deference given to district judges in making various fact findings. Secondly, on a question of law, as intervention fundamentally is -- and ultimately we are talking about the scope and contours of this Court's exercise of original jurisdiction -- what the Court has said is that there are two interests that are ultimately being protected: One is the dignity interest of the State acting in its sovereign capacity on a subject, water, that quintessentially is sovereign; and it is doing so for judicial efficiency purposes, because it allows the Court to expect each State to represent adequately all of the users of water in that State. So, for those reasons, we think that a special master recommendation ought to be reviewed with the same level of scrutiny that all other aspects of a special master’s --",
  "Not in an equitable apportionment. And -- and I think the -- the scope of the relief is important. And that is because the State seeking the relief is assuming the risk that the relief that it wants to get from that State is an inadequate form of relief. Here the form of relief South Carolina seeks goes only against North Carolina. We cannot get an equitable apportionment with Charlotte or the Catawba Project. We can only get it from North Carolina.",
  "Yes --",
  "They might be affected, but only in an ancillary way. It is an -- part of an application to the FERC. The FERC here is saying it does not affect it because the license itself will not dictate minimum --",
  "Neither the agreement –- and this is at page 51 to 52 of our brief, citing 39 of the CRA -- says it doesn't affect water rights. The final environmental impact statement from FERC says it doesn't affect apportionment interstate issues. Both FERC and the CRA itself disclaim any impact on the equitable apportionment action pending here. If I could save the balance of my time.",
  "I have four points, Mr. Chief Justice. First --",
  "No. We seek an injunction enjoining the interbasin transfer statute to the extent it exceeds North Carolina's equitable apportionment. We are here to get our fair share of the river vis-à-vis North Carolina. And Duke's CRA application expressly disclaims any -- any ability to go into the interbasin transfer. That's at page 20, footnote 14, of our motion for leave to file exceptions. The FERC has said it will not affect, in giving its license, the equitable apportionment action now pending before you. In Duke's CRA, at paragraph 39.9, it says it does not affect State water uses. So the only issue here is whether or not those expressed disclaimers should be given effect when South Carolina is simply seeking to determine, as between the two States, the rights.",
  "The license hasn't been issued, Justice Scalia. It's still pending. And that's what FERC has before it, and FERC has said that the CRA will not affect what license is issued, but I want to go back to a fundamental --",
  "No, because the United States can enter -- can affect the interests and represent the interests of its licensees. Duke's interest is completely derivative of the United States' power to confer a license on an energy producer. And the United States here is saying, no, they should not be allowed to intervene.",
  "The agreement is a private contract among various water users, and it is no different than the fact that all users of this river will be affected, one way or the other, by whatever decree this Court issues, whether they are on the South Carolina side or the North Carolina side.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1970, Congress amended the Investment Company Act to provide a cause of action when an investment adviser breaches its fiduciary duty with respect to compensation. The Seventh Circuit upheld summary judgment for Respondent under a legal standard for fiduciary duty that Respondent here no longer defends. For three reasons, the Seventh Circuit's judgment should be reversed. First, under the Court's longstanding precedent, in this context a fiduciary duty requires a fair fee, achieved through full disclosure and good-faith negotiation. Second, the best gauge of a fair fee is what the investment adviser charges at arm's-length in other transactions for similar services. And, third, applying that standard here, Harris charged twice as much in percentage terms for providing virtually identical advisory services in arm's-length transactions with institutional investors. With respect to the first point, the standard for fiduciary duty has been clear from this Court's cases, at least since Pepper v. Litton, in which the Court said that a fair result in the circumstances -- a fair fee -- was an important component of a fiduciary duty. Congress was aware of that standard when it enacted the 1970 amendments to the Investment Company Act. The SEC brought the case to the Congress' attention, and that standard, we submit, is one that Congress intended to incorporate. Applying that standard, where Pepper said that the best gauge of a fair fee is what the person - - the fiduciary charges in arm's-length transactions, applied here, the best way to understand how that fiduciary duty is being breached in this context is what Harris is charging for same or similar services at arm's-length to institutional investors.",
  "The basic concept, Justice Kennedy, is the same. There are two components, where there must be full disclosure of information and a fair result, and that fair result translates in different contexts in different ways. Here, because of the statutory references to fiduciary duty with respect to compensation, one focuses on the fairness of the fee charged. But, as Professor Dumont points out in her amicus brief, the idea of a fiduciary duty is one that is well known in various circumstances of the law, and as applied here the concept goes to the fairness of the fee.",
  "The difference here, Justice Kennedy, is that in those circumstances the indicia of an arm's-length transaction may be achieved. The directors can fire the head of a company. They can call for changes. Here, the investment adviser has appointed the members of the board. As this Court said in the Daily Income Fund case, the earmarks of an -- of an arm's-length transaction are absent precisely because - -",
  "Yes. The concept is fair result through full information and good-faith negotiations.",
  "For lawyers - -",
  "That is true.",
  "That is how courts do it every day in this country, Justice Scalia, when they are asked to make fee applications for reasonableness.",
  "The lawyers' fees in which context, Mr. Chief Justice? I'm not sure I understand the question.",
  "Counsel for the fund is - - that is actually not at issue here, but the issue of what constitutes reasonable expenses may arise in various circumstances. The statute prohibits fees that are unreasonable in terms of their unfairness to the fund. The concept here is that the board cannot fire the investment adviser. So in evaluating the fairness of the fee the adviser is charging the fund, the normal indicia of an arm's-length transaction is absent, and that is the key principle here because this adviser is using the same manager to provide the same research analytics from the same research group, from the same meetings, buying the same stocks, and simply allocating them to different accounts and charging those to whom it owes a fiduciary duty twice what it is getting at arm's-length.",
  "And, Justice Ginsburg, that is where there is a disputed issue of fact for which summary judgment is not appropriate, because the plaintiffs submitted evidence that in fact the services provided to the institutional investors were greater, even though they were being charged a lower amount of money.",
  "Yes.",
  "We have the burden.",
  "It is.",
  "That's true.",
  "We disagree with that last part, Justice Scalia. We agree that Congress did make modifications to the way a cause of action ordinarily would have been brought at common law for breach of fiduciary duty in several respects, including imposing the burden of proof on the investor. Where we disagree is that when they used the phrase \"fiduciary duty\" they intended to mean something less than what fiduciary duty had meant at common law.",
  "Well, there is an issue of fact as to how relevant performance is. They didn't give the money back when their performance lagged behind the market, Mr. Chief Justice, in this case. So the question of whether or not a performance metric is relevant is certainly a factor that will be entitled to less - -",
  "My point, Mr. Chief Justice, is that when they charge the same amount, buying the same stocks, to institutional investors and achieve the same performance, there is no reason why the mutual fund should be charged twice as much.",
  "But the investor doesn't gain because of the marketing skill of the adviser. Simply having a larger asset pool which increases the fee that the adviser can charge doesn't inure to the individual benefit of the investor. And the point of this statute was to provide protection against investors so that when the adviser charged excessive fees that excess would be returned to the fund for the pro rata benefit - -",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, let me just add the extra words of the statute, because what Congress said was a fiduciary duty \"with respect to compensation.\" And so when I say special sense, I mean that Congress used additional words to elaborate on the circumstance in which the fiduciary duty would be examined. Here what is happening is that an arm's-length transaction for the same services -- the same manager is going out and touting his services to the institutional investor, but simply charging them half as much money for providing the same portfolio of management.",
  "The fact that an investor may know going in what the fee is does not address the problem Congress was intending to address, which is that as larger and larger sums of assets were accreted to the mutual fund, the investor was not obtaining the benefits of economies of scale. And that's the central point - -",
  "And that again doesn't address the problem Congress was trying to get at, which is to protect the company, not the individual investor. The individual investor might lessen the damages that that investor suffers, but the fund, the people remaining, continue to pay excessive fees.",
  "A large number of assets under management in mutual funds, something like 26 to 35 percent according to materials that are in the record, are from 401(k) plans, where the investor is essentially locked into the fund that his or her company chooses to make that investment. And even as to investors who are not locked in, there are significant tax consequences where over time an investor might be in the Oakmark Fund and have to suffer large tax consequences in order to get the benefit of the statute - -",
  "And Mr. Chief Justice, as the Court recognized in the Daily Income Fund case, this is a unique cause of action in which Congress was intending to protect the entire corpus of the investors in the fund, because - -",
  "The company is comprised of the investors, Mr. Chief Justice. What the right of action does not do is to provide individual damages to the investor who brings the suit. The recovery inures to the entire benefit of all the investors.",
  "Well, what the Court said in pepper is that fair is what is reflective of what an arm's-length agreement would produce.",
  "Yes.",
  "Because the directors can't fire and walk away from the advisor. In any arm's - length transaction, if I sell you a car and you don't like the price can you walk away.",
  "True. There are two components: Was there full information and good faith negotiating; and was the result fair. In Pepper, the Court said if the result is not fair there can be a breach of fiduciary duty.",
  "Fair against what the adviser actually charged for same or similar services to an outsider who had the right to walk away.",
  "They - -",
  "In practical terms, no.",
  "Because the adviser picks the board of directors.",
  "There is actually no evidence in any record I am aware of where that has actually happened. The directors have no leverage. And that's the problem the Court -- this Court recognized in the Daily Income Fund case. If I could reserve the balance of my time, please.",
  "At this recording here did not make findings -- this was a summary judgment case, and in fact, the Court didn't find that the disputes were nonexistent. In fact, on page 30a, the district court said that the disputes were nonmaterial, and that's a very important distinction because the joint appendix that you have before you contains a lot of evidence in which it is disputed whether or not these were similar services. The Harris manager on page 6 -- JA 650, the portfolio holdings of the funds, are very similar. On 512, the Harris fund manager testimony that, when he buys a stock, he buys it for all mutual funds and independent accounts, with the same investment objective. On 505 to 506, the Harris research director testimony that the managers of the mutual funds and independent accounts share equally all work done by the research department, and 513 to 514, that the Harris fund manager says all of our analysts do research for all of our clients. There is disputed evidence here as to what constitutes similarity, Justice Sotomayor, these are comparing apples to apples because the record indicates that there are separate contracts for the additional fees that they charge to the mutual funds for the additional services provided. We're simply talking about comparisons of money management, but - -",
  "In one small aspect of the damages period, that is correct, and after that was found, they had lower than average performance and higher than average fees, Mr. Chief Justice. It's a damages period that encompasses several years. If I could go back to the point, though, about the fiduciary duty, what Judge Cardozo, when he was on the New York Court of Appeals, said, a fiduciary represents the punctilio of honor, and that is contrasted with the morals of the marketplace operating at arm's-length. It surely cannot be the case that, where you are dealing with a fiduciary duty -- which is a higher standard recognized in the law -- that you can charge twice as much as what you are obtaining at arm's-length for services that you are providing. The Gartenberg court, Justice Breyer, in fact, had the opposite language that you are averting to, and that is at page 694 F.2nd 928, where the Court said, \"The test is essentially whether the fee schedule represents a charge within the range of what would have been negotiated at arm's-length in the light of all the surrounding circumstances.\"",
  "That's right. The Second Circuit that went on to flip it and say, we had to prove a negative, which is not ordinarily what a plaintiff has to prove in any law case, by showing it -- it is so disproportionate it could not have been achieved at arm's-length, and that is where we think the court - - courts have gotten this wrong.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our position is that Congress intended the word \"discovery\" in section 1658 to have its normal and well-established meaning. By contrast, Merck asks the Court to add concepts to section 1658 not found in its text by interpreting the word \"discovery\" to mean suspicion and for the 2-year limitations period to be triggered when facts cause an investor to suspect the possibility of fraud.",
  "Well, we say, at the first part of our submission, that the Court can decide the case on an actual discovery -- actual knowledge standard. We have gone on to brief constructive discovery because, prior to 1934, in the numerous State statutes that use the phrase \"discovery of facts constituting,\" many courts had adopted a constructive knowledge standard. We think we win under either standard. If the Court decides this is an actual knowledge case --",
  "In a fraud-on-the-market case, like this one, where an efficient market is pleaded, there’s no practical difference. In an individual case, where the securities fraud alleges that an individual investor is harmed by the individual actions of some broker or some other person, there could very well be a difference in terms of what the reasonable investor should have known on the basis of information that would be available. And the point of the constructive knowledge standard was to have plaintiffs not rest on their -- their ability to hide information, but to be diligent, reasonably, in ascertaining that information, and the constructive knowledge standard really came to address a case different from the case that we have here, Justice Sotomayor.",
  "Sure.",
  "That would be information that the -- the broker, for instance, would have made available to the investor, that the investor simply didn't look at, or that the investor could have asked for, but -- but never followed up in obtaining. And that kind of constructive knowledge standard, this Court has held in numerous cases, dating back to the 19th century, is an appropriate form of attributing knowledge to a reasonable person. And the cases that we’ve cited in our brief -- Kirby, Wood -- those kinds of cases talk about what a reasonable person in those kinds of circumstances would be imputed to know.",
  "Correct.",
  "That's correct, through reasonable inquiry, that by following up with questions to the broker or to other persons associated with that entity. It's a different theory, concededly, Justice Sotomayor, in a fraud-on-the-market case, which is what this case is.",
  "That's correct, and --",
  "It could be actual or constructive, depending on the facts and circumstances, but the important point to draw away from this is that Congress also wrote in a 5-year period of repose in this statute and followed up on the suggestion of the Lampf dissenters, who believed that the period of repose was too restrictive. So, in 2002, when Congress amended the statute, they cited the Lampf dissenters and extended the period of repose, which created an absolute bar to claims of fraud being brought against defendants. The statute of limitations period -- by using a discovery rule -- was intended to preclude persons from resting on their rights and not taking action when they had discovered the facts constituting the violation. It was not intended --",
  "From the violation.",
  "The violation would be a material misstatement made with scienter. And, here, what we assert in the class period, Justice Ginsburg, is that the first statements that were made with scienter were those statements after Vioxx was put on the market, in which Merck touted the naproxen hypothesis as an explanation for what it asserted to be a cardio-neutral effect of Vioxx, which was only subsequently -- there was empirical evidence to -- tending to disprove that thesis.",
  "That's correct. Under our theory of the case, the period of constructive knowledge of all of the elements of the violation would have occurred in November of 2004 with the publication of The Wall Street Journal article.",
  "No. I'm saying --",
  "First, let me say that the first complaint is now a legal nullity. It has been superseded by --",
  "Shortly before the filing of the first complaint, there were public releases of a study that was done by the Harvard Brigham and Women's study, and that was a large epidemiological study that was the first empirical basis that disproved an aspect of the naproxen hypothesis. Naproxen was not a drug studied at that time. But what the study showed was that Vioxx and Celebrex users had a higher rate of cardiovascular incidents, and, in fact, Vioxx had higher than Celebrex.",
  "Well, to an investor who was following this information, that very well may have led to a strong inference of scienter because of the vociferous denials that Merck subsequently made to a study that was publicly reported as being funded by a Merck grant. Now, whether that would have met a post-Tellabs pleading standard, we will not know because that was not subject to that kind of scrutiny. We’re here on a subsequent, superseding complaint that pleads those allegations, and we’re here on a statute of limitations argument in which Merck attempts to argue that the suit was filed too late, rather than too early. Obviously --",
  "That's correct. But, of course, at that time, Justice Ginsburg, the case wasn't about the pleading standards for scienter of the first complaint. It had long since gone past that, and the fourth and now the fifth amended complaint, which Merck acceded to its filing in the district court after certiorari was granted in this case is now the operative complaint, and I would submit that the allegations well- established the pleading standards for scienter. Of course, that’s not an issue before the Court, and the question of whether the first complaint was premature is also not before the Court. But the fact that there is constructive knowledge only on the basis of new information that came to light is relevant because Merck cannot point to a single fact that came out between the FDA warning letter and the file -- and 2 years before the filing of the first complaint, so that narrow window between September 2001 and November 6, 2001. And, in fact, when the FDA expanded the uses of Vioxx in April 2002, it approved a label that specifically addressed the uncertainty about the naproxen hypothesis.",
  "That’s correct. That was the general rule, prior to 1934, when Congress first wrote those words into the Federal statute. But, Justice Alito, we have also provided information to the Court of a case in the 19th century called Martin -- this is on page 25 of our brief -- in which the standard was seen to be somewhat lower than the normal pleading standard, and that is what a reasonable person would have believed that he had been subject to fraud.",
  "In the legislative reports that accompany the Act in 2002, what the Senate described in its report was a concern that a 1-year period would be too short for a plaintiff to file an action, survive a motion to dismiss, and then gain discovery about the possibility of other codefendants who had participated in that fraud. This was the era, Justice Alito, in which Enron and WorldCom exposed to the world the complexity of vast and difficult-to-ascertain frauds, and Congress was seeking to extend that period so that investors would have an opportunity responsibly to bring cases that would ferret out that fraud and to get at all of the people who might have participated in that fraud. That was the explanation that the -- the Senate gave for that, and that couples with the action by Congress in the PSLRA, which was intended to ensure that these pleading standards would be well investigated and well ferreted out prior to pleadings. The 2-year period was intended to ensure that that kind of action would -- would take place. And when you couple that with the 5-year statute of repose, the statute of limitations is simply an -- an insurance that a plaintiff is not resting too far on information within its possession when the statute of repose is going to provide absolute protection.",
  "Well, the difference -- here is the difference: We accept that the pleading standard rule advocated by the government is the brightest line rule and that this Court should adopt it. If it adopts something less than that and adopts a reasonable person’s believing that fraud had occurred, that might not quite meet the pleading standards, but would nonetheless encapsulate the laws that existed prior to 1934, and we would prevail under that standard, too.",
  "That's correct.",
  "We do agree on that. And the difference is that if you talk to the person in Burma, Justice Breyer, you may not get enough facts to get a PSLRA-compliant pleading on file, but you might have the belief that a fraud had occurred.",
  "No. Our position is that the pleading standard is correct, and that if you don't adopt a pleading standard, something a little bit less than a pleading standard -- their standard -- is that --",
  "The difference -- the space between our the position and the government is really quite small, and it rests on pre-1934 interpretations of “discovery of the facts constituting” that did not seem to tie specifically to pleading standards, but nonetheless adopted a reasonable person standard based on what a reasonable person would have believed that fraud had occurred.",
  "Well, this was brought as a motion to dismiss, Justice Ginsburg. Most times, a statute of limitations defense, which is an affirmative defense that the defendants have the burden to show -- most often they are brought as motions for summary judgment, in which there are undisputed facts that the defendant attempts to argue. Here, I think what the Third Circuit was holding was that, this is not proper as a motion to dismiss and deny it as a motion to dismiss. But there - - it is routine in the law that where there are motions to dismiss, there subsequently are facts developed and subsequent pleadings brought. I don't think that the court was saying anything other than, this is the normal course in which motions to dismiss which should not have been granted would be allowed for further percolation by the case --",
  "I don’t think so --",
  "Well, you can in these ways, because the market had no reaction. The analyst who looked at the FDA warning letter said that this was not changing their information. The FDA has said --",
  "Well, that was part of the factual inquiry that Merck itself submitted as part of its motion to dismiss. Whether the Court treats that as relevant for ascertaining at this time whether to affirm the Third Circuit, I don't think the Court needs to reach, but I would point out that our brief goes into this in quite some detail, that the publicly available information made clear there was absolutely no market reaction that would have led any person reasonably to suspect that Merck did not honestly believe the naproxen hypothesis that it were positing at the time.",
  "To be sure, subsequently information came to light that brought Merck's very serious fraud to public attention. And on the basis of that very serious fraud that had significant adverse consequences to investors, we have brought suit. But it would be the height of irony that for Merck's success in concealing its fraud through the scientific uncertainty that was occurring with the naproxen hypothesis, that it would have this suit thrown out on statute of limitations grounds and never face the day in court that the investors here expect and deserve. If there are no further questions, thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It does not take great mental gymnastics to read the plain language of this statute and resolve it the way the Ninth Circuit did in favor of Respondents. The case is controlled by the plain language of several Federal statutes, and they have been adverted to, to some extent. But I would like to point out to the Court that in 2-1/2 pages of our merits brief, starting at page 26 and going over to page 28, we not only cite the full language in full of the Carmack Amendment and the jurisdictional provision of the STB, but explain how Union Pacific is a delivering carrier within the meaning of the Carmack Amendment; under the plain terms of the statute, they are liable for the loss; the Carmack Amendment applies to their receipt of the property; and the train derailment which was caused by their negligence comes within the plain terms of the Carmack Amendment.",
  "No. In fact, this Carmack Amendment --",
  "-- explicitly says, quote: \"Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not affect the liability of a rail carrier.\" Carmack --",
  "They do not have to issue a separate --",
  "That's correct.",
  "That's correct.",
  "No, it won't, Justice Breyer.",
  "It is not -- it is true and not true, but for different reasons. And if I could take a moment to explain, because I think it is important. In 1978, the plain language of the statute defined what the STB's jurisdiction is. They do not dispute that the last part of the jurisdictional provision is the STB jurisdiction when a -- a shipment is in, quote, \"between the United States and a place in a foreign country,\" but the STB only has jurisdiction to the extent the transportation occurs in the United States. So it is true that imports into the United States are covered by the Carmack Amendment, but only to the extent of the transportation being within the United States.",
  "Let me go back -- let me go back to the international point, Justice Breyer, because the railroads argued against an international uniform rule that would apply both to ocean carriage and inland carriage in the Rotterdam rules. And they made the representation to the international community: You don't need to have a uniform rule that applies to both ocean carriage and inland carriage, because we have this thing called the Carmack Amendment. And they made the representation that the Carmack Amendment would apply to imports, as this Court, in the Woodbury case written by Justice Brandeis, decided in 1920, and a month earlier --",
  "No, I'm arguing that their position is inconsistent with their representations, and, therefore, the plain language of the statute --",
  "What I'm --",
  "Their earlier -- their earlier position was correct under the plain language of --",
  "The plain language, Justice Scalia, as it is currently enforced, I think disposes of the case without any real argument.",
  "Yes.",
  "Correct.",
  "Correct.",
  "Correct.",
  "That's how the whole world --",
  "Correct. And that's how -- that's how Europe operates. Europe has separate conventions for rail and road that apply to damage that occur on land, and the European nations have acceded to the various versions of Hague rules --",
  "Well, it's transport --",
  "But as --",
  "It's the Surface Transportation Board, Justice Breyer, that has the jurisdiction here.",
  "No, they can.",
  "They can.",
  "And I want to get to Justice Kennedy's question. They can. These are background rules that we’re talking about, and they will be contracted around. After the Sompo decision was decided in the Second Circuit, Union Pacific went right out and changed the contracts that they have with ocean carriers to ensure that the ocean carriers would indemnify them if they were liable and did not get the full benefits of contractual extensions. What we're talking about here --",
  "-- is whether there's an American forum for American cargo interests for an American train that is derailed in the United States. That's what we are talking about.",
  "Let me go to that point now, Mr. Chief Justice. The Port of Long Beach is situated more than 20 miles from Los Angeles, and the port has 60 miles of train track with intermodal, multimodal facilities that get the cargo containers which \"K\" Line owns on chassis that \"K\" Line owns, and they have to get from the Port of Long Beach 20 miles away to the Los Angeles train depot where Union Pacific picks them up. Now, under \"K\" Line's theory of the case, they get to have a donut hole in the Carmack Amendment liability provision for that 20-mile transport. We would submit as a factual matter, which of course would need to be done on remand, that there are facts that can be adduced to establish the functionality test which the ICC has long administered to look at the functions being performed as well as --",
  "We didn't make that argument. Our argument was that, based on the functions and them holding themselves out to be a rail carrier, which they have done, they qualify under the normal ICC method of determining rail carrier.",
  "The argument, as the ICC has defined it, also looks at things like the multimodal facilities, like the containers, and -- and the holding themselves out as a rail carrier in their advertising. Those are important parts of the functionality test.",
  "Well, there are -- there are two ways to read the text and resolve the case. One is to say \"K\" Line is the receiving rail carrier when it transfers from the international ocean carriage corporation to the American multimodal transportation operation and gets the goods from the Port of Long Beach up to Los Angeles, and then treat UP, Union Pacific, as the delivering rail carrier. Under the statute, UP is not required -- although the first part says you’re supposed to issue a bill of lading, their liability for the train derailment does not turn on whether they issued a bill of lading or not.",
  "No.",
  "\"K\" Line gets out of the case. We would have to go to Tokyo to pursue \"K\" Line under the bill of lading. But we could continue our suit against Union Pacific as a delivering rail carrier under the Carmack Amendment.",
  "Correct.",
  "Well, you would need to reach the question of whether or not exempt carriage under 10502 takes away the option of a 10709 contract.",
  "Correct. And let me address that, if I might.",
  "Sure.",
  "Under the --",
  "Directly under the Carmack Amendment. And in fact, when Union Pacific removed this case from State court to Federal court, the Federal question was they said: There is a Carmack Amendment claim being asserted against us. That's how we get from State court to Federal court. And when they -- when they sought to transfer the case from California to New York, they did so on the basis of the convenience of 28 of the 32 witnesses to their train derailment being American citizens. So it's not like there needs to be some special -- there’s a special cause of action within the Carmack Amendment, Justice Sotomayor, that provides a means of redress for damaged cargo interests to go directly against the railroad.",
  "Correct, if they caused the damage. That's the whole point of the Carmack Amendment.",
  "Yes. The STB, in an authoritative determination that is entitled to our deference, has said that when it issues an exemption for certain categories of rail carriage, which it has done with the multimodal shipments, those exemptions remove the possibility of a 10709 contract carriage. And the reason for that is that, in both situations, the rail carrier has to provide an opportunity for Carmack-compliant terms to be given to the shipper. If it's exempt cargo carriage under 10502, 10502(e) says that the carrier must provide Carmack-compliant terms in order to take advantage of the exemption and contract under the exemption. 10709 provides contract carriage, but only if the rail carrier provides common carrier tariffs that a cargo interest could ship under. Here, because the transportation is exempt under 105 -- 10205, there is no common carrier tariff that is applicable. And that's why the STB has said if there’s no common carrier tariff applicable under 11101, then there cannot be an opportunity for contract carriage. To do otherwise would be to make the statute a complete deregulation statute.",
  "No -- well, liability, Your Honor, is where you can bring your suit and what your suit --",
  "The -- the way the board has construed this in the letter brief that they filed in the -- in the Second Circuit, which is entitled to our deference, says the Ninth Circuit in Regal-Beloit got it right with respect to the interplay between 10502, 10709, and -- and contract carriage.",
  "No --",
  "That is what this Court held --",
  "Mead did not overrule Auer, and in Auer the Court -- this Court gave deference to a brief by the Federal Government that was setting forth the authoritative --",
  "In that case.",
  "But I don't know why --",
  "It's a distinction without a difference, because here the Second Circuit invited the views of the STB to tell us what do you think is the interplay between these various provisions?",
  "And the STB gave an authoritative view to the Second Circuit so that it could resolve a case in which the STB was not a party.",
  "Those are the chassis. They are the containers that are used to --",
  "No.",
  "There -- the -- COGSA applies tackle to tackle. If the damage is occurring on a ship --",
  "-- the STB has no jurisdiction over that. Carmack does not apply. It is only once the ship --",
  "Well, COGSA itself, which is set out in the --",
  "And under no condition --",
  "Yes. I can give -- the provision of COGSA that you are looking for is the definition of \"carriage,\" which is set forth in --",
  "-- page 48a of the petition appendix, and it is 1(e). “The term ‘carriage of goods’ covers the period from the time when the goods are loaded on to the time when they are discharged from the ship.” And as the Court in Kirby said --",
  "Right.",
  "Carmack only applies if it is carriage and transportation within the STB's jurisdiction. The STB has no jurisdiction over COGSA carriers. That's the Federal Maritime Commission.",
  "The ship is performing two different functions, Justice Breyer.",
  "It is performing an ocean carriage function, and then once it’s on land -- and there are thousands of \"K\" Line containers all over the United States right now where \"K\" Line is performing services, motor carriage and rail carriage services, here in the United States.",
  "They own them.",
  "No, they own the containers that Union Pacific is pulling.",
  "Under the definition of functionality, where that is part of how the STB regulates. And to say otherwise, Mr. Chief Justice, would be to deny the Federal Government the regulatory authority over containers that come into this country representing approximately 80 percent of the trade.",
  "It’s carrying --",
  "But they -- well, at one level, Mr. Chief Justice, it's sort of academic, because the STB exempted from Part A, which includes the Carmack Amendment, those containers, and it did so in an exemption order which we’ve cited in our -- in our brief. So, at some level, there’s an academic quality to this colloquy.",
  "If its delivery contract ended at that point, it did not hold itself out --",
  "-- as a rail carrier --",
  "And can I just add to the hypothetical the fact, which is an important fact: Did the ocean carrier hold itself out to the public as a rail carrier in making the contract with the original shipper? Because that is an important fact that does not help us resolve your particular hypothetical, Justice Sotomayor. If UP is picking up the goods with its equipment, the ocean carrier is not a rail carrier under our theory of the case. There has to be functions being performed that are multimodal functions, and the ocean carrier has to hold --",
  "I think that's the best way to understand the statute.",
  "Well, the --",
  "On 62a --",
  "-- the petition appendix defines the general jurisdiction.",
  "Yes.",
  "And at (a)(2) -- will you look at (a)(2), please?",
  "(a)(2) says jurisdiction under paragraph 1 applies only to transportation in the United States.",
  "In the United States.",
  "Exactly.",
  "Yes, thank you.",
  "Now, it is not true that the law was settled prior to 1978. The Woodbury case applied the Carmack Amendment to imports. Union Pacific v. Burke applied it to imports. And in those cases, this Court made the determination that the words \"from\" and \"to\" were also meaning \"between.\" And Congress, when it cleaned up the statute in 1978 and provided words that are very easy to understand now, was not changing what had been a well-settled practice of goods that were getting -- arriving at a port in the United States and then being transported by land means. And it's important to understand the context in which this arose, because I think our fundamental disagreement with the Solicitor General's presentation is that it ignores the container revolution that was occurring between the late 1950s and the '70s, when this Act was codified and cleaned up. And in that container revolution, prior to the time when containers were used for multimodal transportation, it was common for goods to be repackaged at ports in the United States. They were taken off ships; they were repackaged, put onto trains or trucks, and that required a separate contractual arrangement. Now, this Court, in Woodbury and Burke, had said it is not so important whether or not there is a separate contract, so long as the function and the intent is clear that it is being moved by rail or road in the United States. The Carmack Amendment will apply, Justice Sotomayor. You are completely correct that the purpose of the Carmack Amendment was to hold railroads and motor carriers responsible for the liabilities caused by their loss. But when Congress then cleaned that up and put it in section 3, it was not intending to obviate the clear and unambiguous language of the statute. It was simply providing, you know, some boilerplate that I think is very difficult to cause the Court to override the plain language of the statute today. And in 1995, when Congress eliminated -- terminated the ICC and enacted the ICC Termination Act, it reenacted that language. It did not encompass section 3 at that time, so the statute as it presently exists does not have a statutory pointer as to how you are to interpret the language. And under the normal canons that this Court has instructed for courts and the bar, the easiest way to practice law in this area is to look at the statute, see what it says, and not have to go back, not just through the last iteration of the statute, but the one before that, and not just to be able to look at what was in the U.S. Code, but to have to go back to the Statutes at Large to see what other statutory provisions Congress had put into the statute. That would make the practice of law extremely difficult.",
  "I would -- I would concede the point of interchange at the port, Justice Scalia. I don't think it's necessary for the Court to reach that. I will concede that point, so long as, you know, we are talking about an immediate nexus between the vessel and the ship. And -- and that is not -- not a point that we have to prevail on to win in this case.",
  "There are 60 --",
  "Well, there was no discovery because this was decided on the pleadings as a matter of law. We believe that once discovery is permitted, if you allow the case to go back for factual development, that the facts would reveal that \"K\" Line was engaging in significant rail operations that at least get us beyond -- into the realm of legitimate advocacy.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. That's correct. When my colleague here says that we take the position that Carmack cannot be contracted around, that is not true. Our point here is that when there is exempt carriage, the STB has already defined this as something that can be provided by contract, but we believe that 10502(e) says that they have to provide Carmack-compliant terms. The industry will adapt to a decision by this Court in setting the background rules. We would submit that the simpler regime and the one that the railroad had advocated in the international community was there -- was for there to be a U.S. statute that applies and not to allow complete deregulation through contracts --",
  "That's correct. And -- and the point here about the forum is an important one, because Union Pacific has never thought that in these ocean bills of lading that that entitled American cargo interests to have to go to a foreign country under the ocean carrier's bill of lading in order to vindicate the interests in damage to their cargo. That was an invention by \"K\" Line in this case after UP sought to remove it under the Carmack Amendment and transfer it to New York, and UP joined that motion and has argued throughout that the Carmack Amendment applies. It would be unusual, to say the least, to allow UP now to take advantage of a contractual extension of COGSA where section 12 of COGSA, by its plain terms, in language that is completely ignored by the other side, says COGSA stops basically at the tackle-to-tackle period and does -- otherwise does not affect otherwise applicable law. And there’s a specific reference in section 12 to the Harter Act and any other applicable law. And in 1936, when Congress enacted COGSA to implement the United States -- of the Hague rules, it was aware of the Carmack Amendment.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves a vaccine designed in the 1940s that was administered to Hannah Bruesewitz in 1992, some 30 years after scientists discovered a safer way to design the pertussis component of the DTP vaccine. The Third Circuit held that the Bruesewitzes could not pursue a design defect claim under State law invoking the preemption principle in claiming that the Vaccine Act of 1986 preempted the Bruesewitz's State claim. That holding is in error for three reasons. First, the court overlooked the numerous provisions of the Act protecting manufacturers from liability, but it did not expressly preempt design defect claims. Second, the court misconstrued the word \"unavoidable\" in section 22(b)(1)'s Federal law defense. And third, the court adopted a policy that exposes children to unnecessary safety risks. With respect to the first reason, in the 1986 Act Congress created a program, the vaccine program, that was funded by surcharges on the vaccines that users used, and out of that fund designed a program to pay compensation to persons who were injured by vaccine-related acts. Congress also provided a mechanism for exhaustion through the vaccine court program before a person claiming injury could pursue a State law cause of action. In creating Federal law defenses to the State law that was designed to govern such actions, Congress established certain defenses, but all of those defenses apply on a case-by-case basis. There are no absolute provisions that preclude a State law claim. The Third Circuit misunderstood that basic principle. The defenses that the Vaccine Act created for manufacturers includes such things as a regulatory compliance defense for failure to warrant claims, a learned intermediary doctrine that is instituted at a national level, the imposition of comment k -­",
  "My point is that when one looks at the specific language of 22(b)(1) against the backdrop of these other provisions, it's clear what Congress was intending was to enact a national defense, but not to displace State law completely. And the question presented is whether, on a case-by-case basis, the design defect claims that had been brought by the Bruesewitzes are displaced as a matter of law.",
  "And if one looks, Mr. Chief Justice, at sections 21, 22, and 23 of the Act, what 21 provides is that the Claimant can elect not to accept the vaccine court judgment. Section 22 provides the standards of responsibility, and section 23 provides the mechanisms for trial of the State law claim. And 23(e) provides that the evidence of the vaccine table and what happens in the vaccine court shall not be admissible in the State law claim.",
  "What Congress was intending to do, Justice Alito, was, with the word \"unavoidable,\" to use a word that had a settled meaning in the common law. And that settled meaning referred to the design of the product in light of the current state of scientific knowledge. That grew directly from comment k, the section 402A of the restatement of torts. And in comment k, which tracked the structure of the restatement provision itself, the general rule for the restatement was strict liability for dangerous products, quote, \"although the drug is properly manufactured or properly warned against.\"",
  "There certainly was a debate. The majority view, however, was to adopt comment k as a defense to strict liability claims on a case-by-case basis. And the cases that we've set forth, I think, illustrate that, even the cases that the other side cites. Several of them had been overruled by the time the 1986 act took effect and there was a decided shift in favor in the case-by-case application of comment k. And in the 1987 report, Congress made very clear it intended to preserve that case-by-case approach. That is set forth at page 50 of our brief, Justice Alito. So when one looks at both the words that Congress used in 22(b)(1), the debates that occurred, and the committee reports that explained what Congress is intending here, we believe the intent is unmistakably clear to adopt comment k as a defense to -­",
  "It is not surplus if one reads comment k and understands what the drafters there were intending to get at, which was: If, based on current scientific knowledge, the risks are unavoidably unsafe, meaning there is no way in science we can design a safer product, there will be a defense to a claim of strict liability unless or provided that the product is properly manufactured and warned against. This was a proviso that was intended to ensure that the focus be kept on the unavoidable, unsafe aspects of the design of the vaccine. Now, the other side's view takes other words of 22(b)(1) and renders them surplusage. And I am looking now at page 19A of our reply brief, where we set forth the statutory language, if you want to follow along here. What the other side's view is that after the word \"if\" following the date of October 1, 1988 -- I am at page 19A of the reply brief, the addendum. Under their view, all of the words that follow the word \"if\" and through \"even though\" becomes surplusage, because under their reading the manufacturer is relieved of all liability if, quote, \"the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings,\" and renders the entire concept of unavoidability surplusage. So our view is that what these -­",
  "Under their -- Justice Scalia, looking at (b)(1) on page 19A following the date October 1, 1988.",
  "Under their view, after the word \"if,\" the phrase \"the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though\" is surplusage, because in their view of the statute Congress created a complete exoneration from liability if the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper warnings. They took the concept of unavoidability completely out of the statute. And the word \"unavoidable\" had a settled meaning. There were numerous cases that had construed that meaning in light of the 20-year history of Restatement section 402A. So -­",
  "Justice Ginsburg, that position is incorrect. And there is empirical evidence indicating that the manufacturers, Lederle's Mr. Johnson, testified that the problem with the '86 version of the statute was that it allowed for design defects to go forward. And he urged there to be a regulatory compliance defense.",
  "What I'm saying is that Congress had choices, and one of the choices was to adopt a regulatory compliance defense for design defect claims, and it chose not to do that.",
  "Right. And it is preceded by the word \"if,\" Mr. Chief Justice. And if -­",
  "It's right after the date, 1988. If the injury resulted from side effects. So it is looking on a case-by-case basis in that context, whether the vaccine created the injury or side effect that is being complained of.",

  "It has to be efficacious.",
  "Sure. I will concede that point. The problem here was that an efficacious design existed as of the 1960s and the internal documents indicated that Lederle -­",
  "No. Let me clarify. There are two theories by which there was a design defect claim. One concerned a product by Eli Lilly called Tri-Solgen. That was a split cell vaccine that was developed and sold in the 1960s. It was demonstrated to have far less serious effects for encephalopathy and other residual seizure disorders and problems.",
  "Yes, it was, and it had 65% of the market.",
  "That's correct.",
  "That's the second one for Justice Sotomayor. This was an acellular technique that had been studied in the United States in the 1950s and eventually was developed by the Japanese in the 1980s. That acellular technique was eventually approved by the FDA in the mid-1990s and is now common in all of the three-part VDAP vaccines that are currently on the market. Our point is that the scientists literally knew about that acellular technique. They were beginning to do tests, but they didn't aggressively do it for economic reasons. And that has never been -­",
  "No, there is a reasonableness standard. The standard of due care that State law and tort has always had is: What does a reasonable manufacturer do in the same or similar circumstances? But that is a question, ultimately, of fact, whether or not the economics -­",
  "Justice Kennedy, that was the whole design of the vaccine program, because if you channelled most claims into something that the manufacturers didn't have to defend against or pay the judgments of, the thought was that the vast, vast majority of people would never go to State court. And it would only be in those rare circumstances like the problem we have here where the vaccine court awards nothing that the Bruesewitzes even had to go to State court. Had they filed their claim a month earlier when residual seizure disorder was still on the vaccine table, we wouldn't be here.",
  "There was a debate in the scientific community. The Institute of Medicine believed that residual seizure disorder was medically proved to be a causative factor from the pertussis component of the DTP. There was a disagreement of -- by folks in the Secretary of Health and Human Services as to whether or not that was sufficient to justify legal cause.",
  "Yes. And it was a proceeding, Justice Ginsburg, that had allowed for no discovery against the drug manufacturer.",
  "That's our submission. And that was the design that Congress intended. That's why what happens in the vaccine court under section 23(e), as a matter of law, is inadmissible in a subsequent State court action.",
  "If I may, let me make two points, Justice Breyer, the legal point and the policy point. The legal point is: This Court's cases make clear that there is a clear statement principle. Before Congress is presumed to have displaced State law, it must act with a clear statement. And that is true in the Eleventh Amendment context as well as the preemption context. So if you conclude there is ambiguity, we should win -­",
  "Here, 22(a) answers that question as a matter of law, because it says the State law provides the general rule.",
  "Now, that's the legal point. The policy point is that by channelling the vast majority -- and the SG's brief says 99 percent of the people who go through vaccine court accept the judgment of the vaccine court. And on the First Circuit, the Schaefer decision -- which you wrote, Justice Breyer -- said that even in the instances in which people lose in the vaccine court, they may regard the hurdles and obstacles of the State court process to be so great that they don't bother to try. It's difficult to win these kinds of cases in State court.",
  "Because proving causation and proving the availability, based on science, of an alternative design is not something that is a relatively easy thing to do.",
  "It happened in the moment to come to mind, Justice Breyer.",
  "The point that I want to make is that the threat of liability is only a realistic one if there is a threat that there's actually going to be payment at the end. And Plaintiffs do not bring cases to lose; they bring cases if they have a reasonable prospect of winning based on what the evidence would show a design defect to be. And so when Congress set up this system and it exonerated the vaccine makers of 99 percent of all cases that are going to go through this system claiming defects or problems, if you ask manufacturers around the country that you get a special defense against punitive damages, you get a regulatory compliance defense for failure to warn, you have to have a trifurcated proceeding, and you are not going to have to pay damages or defend the actions 99 percent of the time, most manufacturers in the United States would take that bargain. And so the question -­",
  "And -­",
  "And that's why, going back to the wording of the statute, Mr. Chief Justice, in section 23, where Congress said for someone who had elected not to accept the judgment in 21, you get to go to State court and try to prove your claim.",
  "That's correct. But you have to fight through the defenses that Congress erected in 22(b)(1), (b)(2), and (c), which are quite difficult defenses.",
  "A harder case, but not one that couldn't be proved under State law. The negligence inquiry would look into whether or not a reasonable manufacturer would have tried earlier and more aggressively to obtain FDA approval. Here, we think we can meet that standard, because we had a drug that was on the market, the split cells Tri-Solgen, that was proved to be safer and just as efficacious, and it had been on the market until Wyeth took it off, after Wyeth concluded that when it purchased the rights from Eli Lilly it couldn't manufacture the vaccine Tri-Solgen in a way that it would get it the profit stream that it wanted.",
  "Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg. That was used for all through the series for children's vaccination for DTP. And the problem here with the other side's approach, fundamentally, is that not only does it render part of 22(b)(1) surplusage, and not only does it ignore the many benefits that manufacturers got, but at the end of the day it allows for an exoneration from liability, even for manufacturers who know there is a safer design available. And that fundamentally is something Congress never would have imagined, that manufacturers would invoke an immunity from suit, even when they knew -­",
  "Yes, Justice Kennedy. There is -­",
  "No. Our submission, Justice Kennedy, is that for many vaccines there is no safer alternative, and there could be no design defect claim. But for those instances in which there is a safer alternative, the burden under State law is for the manufacturer to act reasonably in pursuing the safer design, if that is available. It's not -- there is no provision in the FDA regulations or under statute for the FDA to engage in a comparative safety analysis.",
  "Not that I'm aware of.",
  "That's correct. And this very vaccine, Justice Sotomayor, was taken off the market in 1998. And the product that Wyeth used as the substitute for it says in its package insert, this is a safer vaccine than the Tri-Immunol that we have taken off the market.",
  "And the manufacturers win that case, probably, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Only if you accept the -­",
  "Yes. But, Justice Kennedy, that's after an exhaustive process through which they have gone through the vaccine program and the person is dissatisfied with the remedy that's provided. So in these vast majority of cases, unlike drug cases where there is no channeling mechanism, here the vaccine fund is designed to take care of the vast, vast, vast majority of those kinds of claims. And it's only in those rare circumstances where there would be a State lawsuit. If I could reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you. The only law cited by the Government today was section 14 of the Vaccine Act. It is not reproduced in the materials, but it is -- the title of section 14 is a vaccine injury table. It's about recommendations that the CDC makes as to which vaccines will be on the vaccine table, so that when the person goes throughout vaccine court process, you can look and determine whether or not on a no-fault basis the vaccine is listed on the table or not listed on the table.",
  "It's not that the CDC would be wrong, Justice Alito. There is a difference between strict liability and a no-fault arrangement and where negligence would be asserted that a reasonable manufacturer would have come forward with information about a safer design. So what Congress explicitly rejected and they voted this down in the Energy and Commerce Committee was a regulatory compliance defense solely on the basis that the FDA had approved at the time -­",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, yes, that would be a viable design defect claim. And let me give you an example right out of the Joint Appendix in this case. In 1965 Lederle's researchers determine that Lily, the Tri-Solgen, had a \"superior product,\" that's at page 245 of the Joint Appendix. That was in 1967. Eight years later the internal scientists at Lederle wrote a memo to the head of Lederle and said we recommend that we approach Lily for its pertussis vaccine process and/or continue to bid on foreign contracts for this product line with the intent of increasing volume. They had made the determination they were not capable internally of doing a safer design and they knew that for eight years and they nonetheless kept the wholesale pertussis in its market and the documents in this case indicate they did it for economic reasons. And the whole idea behind having design defect claims is to put manufacturers to the duty of putting out safest possible products in light of what the science holds. The CDC -- there are no regulations that the Government cites in its brief or today saying that the CDC does the kind of comparative analysis for safety that is provided under State law design defect claims.",
  "And, Justice Breyer, there are now six DTaP vaccines on the market that CDC doesn't distinguish between them, but if it comes to pass that the science would indicate that one of them was woefully not as safe, and here, their argument is that the vaccine industry is going to go out of business. This vaccine that's at issue in this case was taken off the market in 1998.",
  "He cited no law.",
  "Yes. And if you compare that to what Congress wrote in the statute, our submission is that Congress's words in section 22 take precedence.",
  "We found no law that gives the CDC the authority.",
  "Whether, I'm not.",
  "I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "I'm not aware that the CDC does the kind of granular comparisons that would go to the level of safety that is at issue in this kind of case. And that's what's important here. We are talking about trying to eliminate some of the most horrifying and horrible incidents of injury to vaccines that we compel children to take. And the whole idea behind Congress's scheme was to balance having vaccine supply available with providing a generous form of compensation to those persons who would be injured.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:",
  "I don't think it is, Justice Scalia.",
  "We -- we did object, in the sense that we described the complaint's allegations as JCM writing and preparing and being responsible for the prospectus. And the question of -­",
  "We did say it in our brief in opposition, Justice Scalia, and the Solicitor General, when you called for the views of the Solicitor General, also said in the invitation brief that this case was not an appropriate vehicle for deciding just simply \"help\" and \"participate,\" because what the Fourth Circuit was saying in other parts of its opinion was that JCM was responsible for the prospectuses in all their various aspects: in writing, preparing, et cetera. And so we -­",

You'd have to show the primary violation of the part of the lawyers.",

Matrixx initially sought a major change to this Court's contextual approach to materiality by offering a bright-line standard of statistical significance. In its reply brief, Matrixx offer -- offers a rule that would apply only in the hypothetical scenario where investors rely solely on numbers of adverse event reports in pleading securities fraud. This Court should reject both arguments in this case. The broad theory has numerous legal and policy flaws. First, the longstanding totality of the circumstances test best comports with the varied reasons why investors make investment decisions.",
  "Well, probably not sufficient to go a jury absent a drop in the stock price, absent evidence that there was a scientifically plausible link, absent evidence that the product was highly important to the company's long-term financial prospects.

  "I think this goes back to Justice Kennedy's question as well, Mr. Chief Justice, because there could very well be materiality. The information might be important for investors, but it could very well be that the people making the disclosures don't have the requisite scienter because there is an absence of any plausible relationship. The stock price might drop on news that would not be regarded as news that the most highly scientifically rational people would take into account. But that -­",
  "They're both analytically distinct and related, Justice Kennedy, and I don't have a simple answer for you because many of the reported cases raise issues of both materiality and scienter. What the Court has said in Basic is that the test is the total mix of information and whether that -- under that total mix, the investor would find that information important. In Tellabs, the Court said that whether or not the inferences of scienter could be deemed -- were as plausible as other inferences based on the mental state of the people making the information. So the Court has announced separate tests. In a case like this, there is a natural overlap, and in fact the other side has litigated this case on the basis that no one would have thought within the company, based on the adverse event reports, that there was a basis for thinking there was information. We plead the other way by saying that when you have three medical specialists in three distinct periods where the last wants to bring findings to the leading ear, nose, and throat medical society suggesting that, based on studies that go back as far back as the 1930s, there is a scientifically plausible link based on the zinc ions, that's something that the company should have taken seriously and disclosed to investors.",
  "Well, I guess the first thing I would say is, if the drug has not been FDA approved, that would be material information that investors might want to know. If the drug had been FDA approved and that report was then submitted to the FDA, I think that there's a closer call depending on the, you know, effect of the report that might be on the stock price, because that's the only company product and the other factors that we've mentioned in our brief. I think the question of one event is obviously much more difficult than where there are multiple events submitted by doctors with a scientifically plausible basis on a product that's 70 percent of the company's revenues.",

  "The -­",

This was a homeopathic drug that was put on the market without FDA approval, and there were no requirements of reports until 2006, which was after the period at issue here.",
  "I would start with the language in Basic, which says the total mix of information is what has, long standing, been the test for materiality under this Court's cases. I would say that where there is credible medical professional describing the harms based on credible scientific theories to back up the link, a very serious health effect risk for product with many substitutes, and the effect is on a predominant product line, then the company ought to disclose that information.

But our submission here is that -­",
  "It really depends, Justice Sotomayor, and I don't mean to be evasive, but if there is a product, say, that has some link to satanic influences, and there is some reason to think that a large body of followers in an irrational way might regard there to be satanic influences on the basis of a particular product, a cautious, reasonably prudent investor might want to know that on the basis of that information that most of us would regard as irrational, might affect the stock price.",
  "There are two answers, Mr. Chief Justice. One is, in Basic itself, the Court talked about the actions of a reasonable investor, and this Court and many courts have always looked at a reasonable person standard in making all sorts of these fine judgments about the importance of particular information. But the second answer is -­",
  "What I said was if the product was one that might be, you know, attractive in some way to people who had that particular following. I think you have to link up the product with the nature of the complaint and the effect of the importance of the information.",

  "Well, Justice Scalia, you can certainly write as a prophylactic here that that isn't part of this test. We certainly have here all of the indicia of credible medical professionals on a credible scientific theory on a product that was important to the company's finances and a very serious side effect for a drug that had ready substitutes.",
  "Now, I'm saying two things. One is that there's a difference between scienter and materiality. There is importance of information and an intent to deceive, and the questions are analytically distinct. In your hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, I think you merged them, and I'd like to keep them separate because as we -- as this case comes to the Court, the issue is what is the standard for materiality and whether or not statistical significance is the only way to -­",
  "-- materiality.",
  "On the second one, I would say probably not. And I would say, on the first one, there's not enough information about the side effect and what the drug is intended to solve. I mean, the probability/magnitude test as articulated by this Court goes to the probability of the effect versus the magnitude that would be perceived by investors, and those are important factors they go into. So your hypothetical is very difficult to answer as you have framed it.",

  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to start with Ms. Blatt's answer to your question about whether a provision of the agreement here could confer third-party beneficiary rights. She said yes, so long as the wording wasn't specifically prescribed by Congress. In so doing, she concedes that this is a contract, that normal rules of contract law apply, that the fact that the Secretary has entered into the contract is of no moment, and that third-party beneficiary rights are an inherent part of normal contract principles. So now we're left with the question, does it matter that Congress wrote the particular words that the Secretary used in the agreement?",
  "We submit that the answer is no.",
  "Justice Scalia, you find the intent in part II(a) of the agreement, which is set forth in the petition appendix. And in part II(a), the manufacturer who agrees voluntarily to enter into this agreement agrees that the entity -- that the entity will be charged only a set ceiling price. That is a voluntary agreement of a duty by the manufacturer that runs to the third-party beneficiary covered entities -­",
  "-- who are specified in the agreement.",
  "Well, that's not the standard, Justice Scalia.",
  "The standard for a third-party beneficiary, as set forth in the Restatement and as recognized by this Court, is whether or not the parties objectively intended to create intended third-party beneficiaries whose right to bring the suit would enforce the contract. And that's precisely what we have here.",
  "The 340B entities.",
  "The Government cannot argue for subjective intent of an agreement written 18 years ago. This Court's decisions in contract have always held that the objective intent as expressed by the words of the contract are what courts are to construe.",
  "Okay. Here's what I think I misunderstood perhaps from Justice Scalia's question. For third-party beneficiary rights to create an enforceable breach of contract claim, the parties to the contract do not have to have a provision in the contract saying \"and therefore the intended third parties get to bring a breach of contract claim.\" That's never been the accepted law. The law has always said if the parties intend to create third-party beneficiaries and bringing of that suit to enforce the contract would be within the objective intent of the parties, such a suit is permissible. Now, I want to caution that what is different about this suit from the kinds of implied rights of action suits that the drug companies here claim to be so disruptive is that all we're arguing for is the bargain that the manufacturers agreed to undertake.",
  "That bargain was -- was the discount. It's the delta between what the counties paid and what they should have paid under the discount program ceiling price arrangement in the plain terms of the agreement.",
  "Yes.",
  "I think indirectly here, Justice Alito, that the patients here certainly are incidental beneficiaries, insofar as those who can't afford to pay for the drugs get them for free at the county's expense. This is county money that we're talking about here. Or if they have some limited insurance, they're able to get the drugs at a discount. So they are certainly incidental beneficiaries, but because they are not named and because the intent of the program is to provide the 340B entities with discounted drugs so they can extend scarce dollars farther, they have no right to sue.",
  "No. Our argument rests on the silence of contract with respect to how enforcement would concur. It has long been the case, though, that where the parties intend to displace a third-party beneficiary's rights, the objective intent of the -- of the agreement is what is understood.",
  "That is how the Restatement frames it. It's a -- it is a difficult line I think sometimes to understand the difference between an intended beneficiary and an incidental beneficiary. Certainly, the manufacturers here are incidental beneficiaries -­",
  "-- because they have access to this market.",
  "But that is the key, Justice Sotomayor. The price discount is where all the action is in this program. These prices, between 1990 and 1992, were being raised by the drug manufacturers as against these entities, and the whole point of Congress enacting this statute was to confer the same discounted drug program to the covered entities as had been done through contracts to the State Medicaid rebate program. And that's why the provision in the amendment -- sorry, in the agreement that says thou shalt not charge the covered entities more than the ceiling price is exactly where you find the intended third-party beneficiary rights, because that's their money that's being spent. It's not Federal -­",
  "Number one, there's no evidence that Congress intended there to be a departure from normal operating contract principles, and this Court, in Winstar, in Mobil Oil, in Jackson Transit, in Central Airlines -- all said that when Congress uses contracts or agreements, it intends to incorporate the full cluster of the common law rights as they've existed. And third-party beneficiary rights have been recognized for 350 years, even before the founding of this republic. Now, as to the disruption, I think it's a canard, because what we're talking about here is one price that would govern all 14,500 covered entities. So if Santa Clara gets the discount price for Lipitor, say, that is the best price, and it will be charged and chargeable to all of the 340B entities across the nation. So in terms of administrability, one suit actually can solve the deficiencies in the government enforcement program, and the government can participate in this suit.",

The -- this is a different agreement than under the Medicaid rebate agreement, which is set forth in the joint appendix, where the States are the third-party beneficiaries of those agreements. I'm not sure that the State actually has standing to bring these particular claims. That is not something that has been tested. But what I would say is that if you reject our argument here, you are substantially undercutting the ability of the States to bring the same kinds of overcharging claims against drug manufacturers under the Medicaid rebate program. That's what the States' amicus brief here makes clear. The SG has a very fuzzy footnote at the very end of the Government's brief that does not set forth a clear standard that differentiates why 340B entities' third-party beneficiary rights are any different from States' rights under the Medicaid rebate program.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I don't think that was the basis for Judge Saris's opinion in the District of Massachusetts, which looked at the third-party beneficiary theory of the States in giving them a place at the table in bringing these kinds of claims. And to the extent that that analysis bears out anything, it tends to cast doubt on the Government's theory that these are somehow regulatory contracts that suggest a blurring of the normal lines between regulation and contract. That theory, the regulatory contract theory, has been rejected by this Court in Winstar and in Mobil Oil, where the Government tried to argue that because it was implementing regulatory policy through contracts, somehow normal contract principles don't apply, and this Court rejected that.",
  "Well, the -­",
  "Justice Scalia, and that is why resort to the normal canons of construction that this Court has long applied to government contracts is what is most pertinent here. The Government, I don't think, can point to a specific provision of the cooperative federalism that empowers States to engage in any greater enforcement power than a normal third-party beneficiary under this Court's normal cases, and back to Central Airlines and American Surety, which, a hundred years ago, recognized a third-party beneficiary's right to bring suit on a breach of contract and held that the absence of a specific enforcement power in the statute was not enough to deny the normal operation of law for the breached party to sue for that breach. That's common in the law.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I think if you took that argument to its logical extreme, you would have come to a different answer in the Arthur Andersen case, where, there, you recognized a third-party beneficiary's right to invoke a statute to get an arbitration agreement upheld. And I think you would have come to a different result in the Miree v. DeKalb County case, in which the Court said that just because there is an FAA contract with a local airport authority does not deny a third-party beneficiary right to sue if there is an adverse effect on adjoining land because you would have said that, because the adjoining land owner had no specific enforcement authority, that person or entity would be out of luck. I think the -- this Court's -­",

  "But the -- Justice Ginsburg, those cases all involve the imposition of duties on the part of an entity or actor out in society. Here we're talking about voluntary action. The drug manufacturers can decide not to participate and not sign the agreement. And they have the right, under the provisions allowing termination, to terminate the agreement at will with no reason whatsoever. But -­",

  "There -­",
  "And there are two ways to calculate it. Under the more complicated formula that is designed to enhance the profits of the drug companies, it is a more complicated endeavor. All of these cases, Justice Ginsburg, all of them, have been with the simple formula, which is has the drug company given its best price to some other purchaser in the market. That's where the False Claims Act cases that they acknowledge do not create such an intrusion into the program that somehow they can't be brought -­",
  "Well, no, the difference in a qui tam case, as your question earlier to my colleague earlier acknowledged, Justice Ginsburg, is the government doesn't have to intervene in a False Claims Act case. What's different there is that there has to be some inside whistleblower who can pass through the very difficult hurdles of a False Claims Act case; whereas here we're talking about benefit of the bargain. The manufacturers agreed by contract they were only going to charge a ceiling price, and we assert, based on, you know, quite extensive reports by officers of Inspectorate General that they have not been charging that price. They've been charging in excess of that price, and all we're asking for is the delta. And the Government in its Massachusetts submissions has acknowledged that this type of best price litigation is not so complicated because all one needs to do is figure out did the drug companies sell the particular drug to some other entity for a lower price; and if that's so, that's the price you apply across the board to all the 340B entities. The argument about distraction and intrusion, Justice Ginsburg, I would respectfully submit, is a gross overstatement of what actually happens in this type of litigation. And to the extent that there are complexities, the complexities are introduced by the drug companies for the sole purpose of masking what price they are charging to the 340B entities. Because all these various mechanisms, the bundling of drugs, the use of kickbacks and payments to purchasers are all designed to mask what the true price of the drug is. And if Congress intended anything in the program, and in getting the Secretary to implement this program through statutes, it was that the 340B entities who are providing drugs and medical service to the poorest of our citizens should be entitled to the benefits of the collective market created by these 340B drug purchases. And that's all that we're asking for here.",
  "We don't know, Justice Ginsburg, is the simple and plainest answer I can give you. And the reason we don't know is because the Secretary has already missed the first statutory deadline for issuing implementing regulations. There was no statement of rules in the notice of proposed rulemaking, as is ordinarily the case for agencies. The Secretary simply put out for comment that we are going to develop procedures and rules. So we don't know whether or not the Secretary will express some further intent as to how these new rules are to apply. But I would submit that this Court's cases are very clear, that a later enactment of Congress is not intent of what an earlier Congress has stated, and the absence of any specific remedial provision coupled with the use of agreements carries with it the ordinary presumption that Congress intended for that cluster of common law rights to be associated with the agreement. And that's certainly been the way this Court has enforced contracts involving the government itself. If there are no further questions, we'll submit.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is a case that presents a non-existent problem and a solution that is in search of a non-existent problem, because there are no real reported cases where there have been problems arising under the Rogers instructions that have become the model instructions under the Federal Rules for over 50 years. And if could I just begin, Justice Kennedy, with your question which opened this up, proximate cause serves two principal functions. One is to limit the scope of the persons to whom the tortfeasor owes a duty; and the second is to limit the kinds of injuries that that person would be liable for. The innovation in FELA that is so important to understand about why the relaxed causation standard became the accepted standard under FELA was that FELA, by its plain terms, did away with the first concept of proximate cause because it limited the duty to the employee by the employer. There is no one outside of that relationship that can bring an action under FELA. And the second thing that it did was it put into what is now section 51 that if the negligence results in, quote, \"in whole or in part\" from the negligence of the railroad, that is enough for injury. At common law the proximate cause standard required that the railroad's negligence be the sole cause. So the innovation that created the relaxation in the causation standard was the inclusion of these words in part, and so over time -­",
  "And this Court has rejected that kind of approach almost from the beginning of the statute. In Campbell in 1916, the Court asked whether FELA has completely eliminated the idea of proximate cause.

  "It's -- it's not one that's consistent with the Court's cases. And let me point you back to the day Rogers was decided. If we accept for purposes of argument -- and I'm only accepting it for these purposes -- that Rogers was only about multiple causes, on the very same day it decided two other cases that arguably were only about single causes. It decided a case under the Jones Act, the Ferguson case, and it decided another case under FELA, the Webb case. In both of those cases, there were no multiple causes, there was no contributory negligence; but what the Court said was that on today we are announcing this standard, we apply that standard to overturn directed verdicts where juries had come to the conclusion that the railroad's negligence had played a part, even a slight one, in producing the injury sustained by the worker.",

  "It was certainly an element of the existence of the condition. But what the Court's cases, Justice Scalia, after Rogers have done, and I think this is an important part of the history, is that there are a couple of outlier cases, to be sure. Courts have corrected them all by saying that the judge -- that the jury could not have reasonably found based on common experience that this snake bite or what have you was proximately related to -- played a part.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Justice Scalia -­",
  "Well, let me start with this by saying that the Court and the language of the statute have already eliminate six possibilities for proximate cause; and the question now is whether there's something additive to the words that Mr. Rothfeld now proposes for the first time, because this was not language that they proposed in their proffered jury instruction, which can be found in the red brief at page 11. There they followed the Illinois proposed instruction which says \"natural or probable sequence.\" That language does not appear in Brady. In Brady, a 1943 case from this Court, the words are used \"natural and probable consequence,\" a consequence, of course, being a result, a sequence being an order of events. Now, their instruction rests on the word \"probable,\" which of course in common understanding and most juries would commonly understand, \"probable\" means more likely than not, which is directly in contention with the statutory words \"in part,\" and directly contrary to the way courts had universally understood this language since Rogers.",
  "That is correct, Justice Breyer. And in the cases -- and there really are only a few cases where you can find these kind of outlier facts and these kind of, you know, \"out there\" situations, and one of the reasons is because FELA is only a compensatory damages statute. It only addresses the actual injury and the compensation for the worker. There are no punitive damages, there are no attorney's fees, there are no treble damages.",
  "The negligence theory here, Justice Kennedy, if I could go back to that, was not stated in a way that we would subscribe to by -- by Mr. Rothfeld. Our theory of negligence at trial was twofold. One was that these wide-boded locomotives were not appropriate for the switching exercise that the train men were doing on that day, and in fact the supervising engineer said this was the only time that he was aware in his long experience where these wide-body locomotives were used for this specific purpose which required a lot of braking activity. The second theory of negligence was that Mr. McBride was put to this purpose without proper training. He has complained on the day; he was uncomfortable and he didn't know whether he could operate that locomotive; and the jury was entitled reasonably to infer that that poor training was a -­",
  "Because -­",
  "His -- let's start with his poor training. There was testimony that a person who was more skilled in the art of dealing with a wide-boded locomotive would be able to manipulate the independent brake with the automatic brake in a way that would not cause the repetitive stress that Mr. McBride suffered. And there was further testimony that using a wide-body locomotive, which is more difficult to manipulate for the switching operations, and here we're talking about moving in and off main tracks to couple trains, train cars so that they can be used for a longer destination -- that that kind of equipment was not suited for the purpose. Mr. McBride's testimony was when he had used the wide-body locomotive, he had done so on long trips over long distances that didn't require the same kind of ready, manipulative braking of the independent brake.",
  "It's foreseeable if the railroad is using a piece of equipment without training the person.",
  "For a purpose that it's not ordinarily used for.",
  "They didn't ask for foreseeability, Justice Scalia.",
  "What I -- I would say this Court -­",
  "My definition, what I think the Court did in Rogers was to try to end the debate over how confusing the word proximate cause is in these kind of cases by offering simple and direct instructions that juries could understand and apply, and that has been the case over the last 50 years.",
  "I would take the words of Rogers. I think the jury here was properly instructed.",
  "The words are on page 10 of the red brief, Justice Scalia, and it follows the model form instruction that's used in all the Federal courts, \"defendant caused or contributed to plaintiff's injury if defendant's negligence played a part no matter how small in bringing about the injury. The mere fact that an injury occurred does not necessarily mean that the injury was caused by negligence.\"",
  "Whether you think it's \"but for\" or not I think is beside the point.",
  "Those words mean that \"but for\" plus a relaxed form of legal cause associating the negligence in playing a part in produce the injury. That's how Rogers understood it.",
  "Well, I would disagree with that Justice Scalia, and I think the Rogers Court disagreed with that too, because after Rogers this Court upheld in Inman a case on a directed verdict where it concluded after the Rogers instructions had been used that nonetheless the negligence of the railroad had not played a part. That's a case involving a drunk driver who hit a flag man at the site of where the flag man was operating.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well -­",
  "Yes. I think that the concept of foreseeability is one that has alternated in and out of this Court's cases, but let's take the case of Gallick in 1963, where a fetid pool with vermin and rats were allowed to live by the railroad's negligence, and it was believed that an insect was growing -- insect bodies were growing in that fetid pool, and as a result of that insect bite, the injured worker's legs had to be amputated by the effect of this insect bite. Now, many people would argue -- in fact, the lower court had concluded -- that it was not reasonably foreseeable that the railroad's negligence in allowing that stagnant pool to exist would nonetheless lead to the injury sustained by the worker.",
  "That's correct. But what the court had also done was to rely on earlier cases in which it's saying these concepts really are relaxed because the purpose of FELA is to provide a substitute, if you will, for workers' compensation, where if you can establish negligence on the part of the railroad and it causes, in part, the injury, the railroad will be liable for that. And that's why this -- these concepts of proximate cause really are getting at a different problem, which is that when these statutes are enacted, you're trying to guard the defendant's liability against the entire world. And that's why it makes sense to impose some kind of restriction for foreseeability or for directness, because otherwise anybody could be liable to anybody else. Here, that problem is removed, because the railroad is the only -- can only be sued, under FELA, by the employee, and only if its negligence plays a role in producing that injury. If I could go back to the words that Mr. Rothfeld's trial counsel had proposed, the \"probable sequence\" word is now not even used anymore in Illinois. So it would be very odd to think that you would reverse an instruction here, where the proffered instruction by the railroad doesn't even State what -- the proximate cause instruction in the model language. Now the model language under Illinois calls for the natural and ordinary course of events. That's how proximate cause is now done under the Illinois proposed instructions. And it's hard to know how that language, Mr. Chief Justice, takes us any different from the common instruction that all juries are given, to use their common experience and their common sense in evaluating the evidence. If what proximate cause now means under these types of standards is the ordinary course of events, all we're doing is asking juries to apply their common sense without introducing the word \"proximate cause,\" which has been demonstrated to confuse juries because most of them, you know, many think that \"proximate\" means something like estimate or -­",
  "And we're delighted with that concession, Your Honor.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I'm not entirely sure how a trial judge would take a request for further clarification of this word's -- this Court's words that clarify the \"resulting in whole or in part from.\" I'm not aware of any cases where anyone challenged the use of the Rogers language on the ground that it wasn't simple and direct and therefore couldn't be understood.",
  "I beg your pardon?",
  "I think -- and I've never served as a trial judge, but I think my -- my direction would be to go back and try again based on the words that are there, because the whole idea behind these words was to try to end the debate between this Court and many State courts that simply didn't grasp that FELA was intended to provide a remedial statute with a causation element that was a weaker causation element than in normal negligence cases. And so this Court was taking dozens of cases under FELA between the 1930's and the 1950's in which the Court was looking at directed verdicts by State supreme courts that were overturning jury verdicts. And the whole idea behind making this the language of what constitutes a jury case was to remove the appellate review process from a lot of these things and to leave these questions up to the common sense of the jury.",
  "If the jury asked a question, I think the judge would write back and say, No, that's not correct, the words -- please focus on the words: The negligence playing a part, however small, in producing the injury. I mean, I'm not aware if juries get to this but for versus what is a relaxed -­",
  "No, Justice Scalia, our position is that it is but-for plus a relaxed form of legal cause that's been well-recognized in the cases and hasn't produced a problem. Surely the burden is on the railroad to come up -- I would have thought that if they wanted to overturn the pattern instructions that have been used in nearly a half a million cases since Rogers was handed down, that they would have more than a case that they cite from one of their amici. I mean, they don't even cite the Richards case in their main briefs. And so surely -- you know, we're here to debate these hypotheticals, I would suppose, but they don't have any relation to the real world.",
  "I think the trial judge says, No, it is not necessary for it to be foreseeable in a direct -- if the negligence plays a part, however small, in producing the injury. And that's why in cases like the Ferguson case, which was decided the same day as Rogers -- I mean, that's a very out-there set of facts, where the ship steward -- and remember, what you decide here also applies in the Jones Act for sea workers as well. But in that case, the Court said it was a jury question, whether the failure to provide an appropriate to implement to scoop hardened ice cream from the freezer on the ship was foreseeable, whether or not the ship's steward, in serving the ice cream, would reach for a butcher knife to try to chip away and lead to the severing of two of his fingers. I mean, we're talking about a dangerous situation, Justice Alito. At the time that FELA was enacted, in a year prior to that, some 12,000 people died and there were hundreds of thousands of injuries, and the idea behind the statute was to provide a broad remedy so that rail workers could be compensated, not get extra damages like punitive damages, but just compensated for their injuries. And so the result is that railmen know they're going to have to go before juries exercising their common sense, and juries have, in many, many cases, ruled in favor of the railroads. And that system ought to be allowed to continue. If I could go back to one last point, and that is the idea of statutory stare decisis. We believe that because Rogers construed the \"in whole or in part\" language, it's entitled to statutory stare decisis where jury instructions have used that language. And at some level, this case is not too far from the Hylton case, which was decided in the early '90s, except the difference is in Hylton, the Court had dealt with a case from the early 1960s called Parden. And that case had had many of the underpinnings of -- of the question there that had been discredited or undercut by subsequent decisions. Here, there are no cases since Rogers that suggest doubt on the general validity of the Rogers rule. You have the cases that were decided in the immediate proximity of Rogers; you have Gallick in",
  "And my answer to that, Justice Ginsburg, is that after Rogers, the Court applied the Rogers language to single cause cases. We have Webb, we have Ferguson, we have Kernan, we have Gallick, we have the statement in Crane that comparing the actions of the nonemployee, the -- the explanation for why the nonemployee has to go to common law is because there are these special features of FELA, one of which is no common law proximate cause and the elimination of contributory negligence and assumption of the risk. And then subsequently when the Court in Ayers and then in Gottshall says very clearly these are ways that FELA has departed from the common law and from the other statutes, in Gottshall the Court was very clear that it is relaxed causation and that this is one of the departures from normal common law standards. It would seem odd to hold now that all of a sudden we're going to talk about common law standards for causation where the Court over a series of decision over the last hundred years has knocked out six of the prevailing versions of proximate cause that were then in vogue. That would be a very odd way to -- to rule.",

It's worked, it's allowed juries to exercise their common sense without being confused by these elusive proximate cause formulations. The other side has failed to identify a problem, and there's not the slightest reason to think that any alternative formulation would work any better.",

So, the only anomaly here is that he happened to be working on a fixed platform 98 percent of the time. And the question is whether the permissive workers' compensation benefits provided under OCSLA carry with him when he happens to be injured on land as a result of the shelf operations.",

  "Well, let me answer your question this way, Justice Scalia.",
  "There are a number of floating platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. They're operating on the outer continental shelf as well as on the Western Pacific - -",
  "Yes. That's correct.",
  "But the point is that they get a Jones Act remedy if they happen to be injured on land. So, Mr. Chief Justice, under your hypothetical, if the Jones Act seaman is driving to Reno and there's an accident, he's covered under the Jones Act and gets to have a Jones Act remedy, notwithstanding that the injury has nothing to do with his service on the vessel itself.",
  "No, what I'm saying is that the - -",
  "If the work is substantially related and the causal connection goes to the employment relationship, to the operations, the worker is covered under OCSLA.",
  "There is - -",
  "It is, to be sure, a more comfortable fit to the actual language of the statute than imposing and superimposing a situs-of-injury requirement, which is nowhere to be found in section 1333(b).",
  "Well, if the work is arising out of the course and scope of employment, which is the natural way that these workers' compensation regimes work, and it is related to the shelf operations, our submission is, yes, he is covered under OCSLA.",
  "That -- that's correct, Justice Ginsburg. It's the easiest to administer test, too, because the way workers' compensation insurance works, the employer will -- based on the payroll of the workers who are out on the shelf and its overall payroll, will pay workers' compensation premiums, and under the Department of Labor regulations, it will add an endorsement for those workers whose status it controls, would be covered under OCSLA and thereby get the higher Federal benefit.",
  "Well, our submission would be he would be covered because he's directly injured as a result of the operations on the shelf. It's a two-factor - -",
  "Well, that person is going to be covered under our submission because it's a two-part inquiry. You look at the nature of the relationship, and you look at the nature of how the injury came about. And under those circumstances we agree with the Government, that if somebody is -- if an employee is out on the platform and is injured as a result of operations, that person is covered.",
  "I would submit that the incongruity - -",
  "It's even greater under their hypothetical with the helicopter worker, because they want to get the person who's riding in the helicopter out to the shelf covered under the Longshore Act, and yet that flies directly in the face of this Court's holding in Herb's Welding, that when he's on the fixed platform, he doesn't get longshore benefits. And so, here under their hypothetical - -",
  "No. Under his submission - - his submission is that when they fly out in a helicopter and they crash in the water, they get longshore benefits. But if they actually made it to the platform, under this Court's holding in Herb's Welding they would not get longshore benefits - -",
  "-- if they were in State territorial waters.",
  "The way this Court handled that under in seaman context under Chandris was to look at the totality of the circumstances of the worker's employment, and that seems to be - -",

  "Because he's the kind of person that Congress wanted to provide coverage to under Federal worker -- remind -- remember, in 1950 - -",
  "Our test actually is substantial work. We don't disagree with the Government's adoption of a Chandris 30 percent line. That seems appropriate in light of the fact that many of these workers come on for 2 weeks, are off for 2 weeks. They're working 12-hour shifts while they're out on the rig. It seems appropriate that the coverage should go with them when they are - -",
  "That's what the Government -- I have no brief to defend, Mr. Chief Justice, in terms of where that line is, because my -- my client's husband - -",
  "The point that Congress was trying to get at -- and these are platforms that were covered by State workers' compensation in 1953 -- was to extend the more generous Federal benefits to encourage an industry that was a nascent industry to develop the resources of the outer continental shelf, to provide uniformity, to provide benefits to the workers who were exposed to the perils that were out on the platform. And so, it makes sense, we submit, that when those workers who are -- who are subjected to those circumstances have the same Federal benefits. And there are substantial benefits. My client, for instance, got a one-time lump-sum payment of $42,000 for the death of her husband, as opposed to the Federal benefits that would be approximately $466 per week during the remainder of her period as a widow. And the State benefits would be credited against any Federal benefits that she would be getting in the future. But it's -- it is a substantial dimension to the life of a worker out on the shelf.",
  "The scrap metal that Mr. Valladolid was charged with moving at the time of his the death was very likely the same scrap metal that he personally had taken off the shelf, or someone in his position would have taken off the shelf. And to Justice Kennedy's point, the equipment is heavy, dangerous, difficult equipment. Just the fact that it is moved off the shelf for a cleaning, scrap, for removal, et cetera, is an immaterial difference. In their reply brief, they concede that an oil spill worker who's cleaning up this oil spill from an offshore event is going to be covered under a -- what they call a proximate cause standard -- under any kind of substantial connection proximate cause. Proximate cause is a legal policy that determines how you want to limit the scope of the injuries that would be covered. In a workers' compensation scheme, Justice Scalia, you were completely right it makes no sense. And so, if you adopt some kind of substantial connection, it has to be very loosely related. As the Court in the FELA context last term held in CSX v. McBride, where you have a negligence standard, it makes even more sense to have a very relaxed standard of causation under workers' compensation.",
  "I don't think so.",
  "You have to be an employee.",
  "It has to be an employee. If -- if your hypothetical is the independent contractor on land, it has to be an employee in order to be covered. And that person doesn't qualify, which creates another set of - -",

  "If you could give me the rest of the facts of your hypothetical, Justice Scalia.",

  "Yes. Because those workers -- those workers -- I think it's hard to imagine the kinds of - -",
  "This Court's articulation of that standard, Justice Kennedy, in the Chandris test has been the subject of litigation in the lower courts, and my understanding is that the courts have kind of worked out the various factors and standards that go into the nature of the employment standard - -",

  "As I understand the case law, Justice Ginsburg, there are a range of factors that go into the nature of the sea workers' relationship to the vessel, and they go to -- they go to duration, they go to the performance of duties in the completion of the mission of the vessel and the like. And there are a range of standards. Obviously, the facts of each crew member is difficult to unpack in a hypothetical at this time.",
  "Correct.",
  "And as a practical matter, Mr. Chief Justice -- and I don't represent the insurance company here -- but the way I understand that it works is that, on an annual or a periodic basis, the company and the insurance company get together through some auditing process where there's verification of the workers who are OCSLA workers and thereby get the longshore benefits, and the company and the insurance company work that out to determine either numbers or particular individuals or the like. And so, here what we're talking about is a situation where the employer is not liable for the damage. It's an insured risk, and - -",
  "It's a different form of liability, and it's one that based on the way workers' compensation traditionally is developed -- and I would direct the Court to the opening chapters of Larson's monumental treatise on workers' compensation, where he basically says if this is a social compact in which the employer doesn't have to face liability for personal injuries in tort but gets insurance, and the premiums are then passed on to the consuming public of that particular entity's goods.",
  "Well, under this statute, no; (b)(2), as Justice Sotomayor referenced, it is -- it is an employer, some of whose employees are engaged in, quote, \"such operations.\" And Mr. Valladolid was exactly the kind of person who was engaged in such operations. So, our submission, Justice Breyer, is that that is the kind of person that Congress contemplated when it was focusing on the work force that would be engaged in development of the outer continental shelf. If the Court has - -",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, if I could put it this way, the pushback for the but-for test in its broadest sense is that there isn't a natural kind of a way of confining some restriction to it. And so, if you look at the statute in terms of what it naturally must have meant by Congress, there is a natural limit, and it is not just complete but-for causation, but there are an effort -- there is an effort to try to restrict the scope of the compensation. Thank you.",

  "That was actually I think pursuant to the Safety Appliance Act, Justice Sotomayor, if I'm not -- if I'm not mistaken. And the principle behind the safety in use regulation that this Court construed in Napier was to ensure that locomotives were safe for fit use on the line. And that was the consistent construction both in the ICC's statement that it made in 1922 and in this Court's post-Napier - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Our position is that it was not pursuant to the Locomotive Inspection Act that the ICC promulgated that rule. As the Court has said in numerous cases, the ICC had rules in place with respect to different aspects of the train at different points in time, but the Locomotive Inspection Act was designed to address a very specific problem, which was boilers exploding on the line when the train was in operation. And that is the consistent way that the ICC, and subsequently the Federal Railroad Administration, has construed the Act.",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Well, of course in Ray you addressed the Port and Tanker Safety Act, as well as the Port and Waterway Safety Act. And in the United States v. Locke case, the Court subsequently looked at Ray in terms of design in a statute that also specifically included the word \"repair and maintenance,\" which is absent here. But what the Court was getting at in Ray was to ensure that States were not using their law to interfere with the design of equipment. Of course, that was for - -",
  "No.",
  "If I could make two points about that, Justice Sotomayor. That's not actually correct. The first is anything that the Court might think about design does not impair our failure-to - warrant claims, which entail no challenge to the design of a locomotive at all, only to the instructions for its safe use. But to the - -",
  "No. My second argument is that the design claim here involves repair work or problems uniquely; it does not include or intrude on the fitness for service standard that this Court announced in Napier or that has consistently been applied. The asbestos harms that the repair workers here faced are unique to the repair process, where they are scraping off the - -",

  "But the point here is that it is not to be broken down. And the locomotive repair workers here face unique hazards in repairing locomotives whose safety standards are to ensure that they work properly on the railroad line, not when they're being taken apart and repaired. That they - -",
  "That's absolutely correct. That's why this is - -",
  "-- a unique hazard faced by the repair workers.",
  "If it did, it would be covered under the Locomotive Inspection Act safety standard, and that would be covered by Federal law.",
  "That's correct, and - -",
  "No. Well, it's governed by a different statute, which is found at 49 U.S.C. 303.",
  "Well, if I could finish my answer to your previous question, Mr. Chief Justice, there's a specific statute on that point, and it predated the Locomotive Inspection Act, and it provided that when there was a crippled locomotive, the railroad did not face liability, civil penalties, to bring the crippled locomotive back to the yard, but it specifically said if a worker was injured during that process, the railroad would face liability. Our point here is that the Locomotive Inspection Act's field should be construed narrowly because in 1970 Congress expressly and comprehensively legislated in the Federal Rail Safety Act and provided a conflict pre-emption regime in which if a State had a rule in place, that rule would be permitted to survive unless and until the Federal Rail Administration issued a regulation. And there has never been a regulation on asbestos.",
  "Well, first, I would urge you not to read Napier like a statute, although Justice Brandeis is obviously - -",
  "(B) is that he was addressing himself to fitness for service standards on the line, the Wisconsin and Georgia statutes at issue there purporting to regulate what the locomotive could do while it was in operation on the line. That's not what the claims in this case entail.",
  "Yes.",
  "First is if you accept our proposition that warning claims are valid negligence claims. The warning claims are not -- do not affect the equipment, how it is made at all. It's simply how do you use the equipment safely. Secondly, the design claims here go to the unique hazards faced by repair workers. You could use asbestos, under our theory of the case, on the locomotive in exactly the same way that the locomotive equipment manufacturers have done, so long as there's a safer way to take the asbestos off the locomotive in the repair yard. That is a distinct kind of design claim that doesn't go to the safe operation of the locomotive; it goes to what hazards are created when a repair worker is doing maintenance work on it.",
  "That would be - -",
  "Both. The dust cloud is something that can be warned against and protected against with protective gear that has nothing to do with the design of a locomotive. There are, and there is evidence that there are, safer and were safer ways -- I remind you that asbestos isn't used on locomotives anymore, so this is part of an historical debate here - - but in ways that could be removed that would not create the cloud dust. That's the essence of the design defect claim. And the LIA and the FRA do not regulate in the repair shop. So, there's a complete gap here in terms - -",
  "No. Absolutely - - absolutely can do that under the Federal Rail Safety Act, which, again, empowers the Secretary.",
  "It -- it very well could because it's a fitness for service standard. But it always -- and if you look at its regulations, in parts 229 and part 230 of 49 C.F.R., it always issues these regulations under both authorities because the FRSA expanded it.",
  "It would have to do so under the B&O Railroad case in the early 1930s -- there was another Justice Brandeis opinion -- in which it would have to make a finding that to make that regulation that you posit, Justice Kagan, was necessary to avoid unnecessary peril to life or limb. In that case, the Court struck down the ICC's attempt to issue a regulation on a particular type of equipment because the ICC could not make that demonstration. So, in the current world, the FRA would regulate under the FRSA; it would not regulate under the LIA because under this Court's jurisprudence it is a harder standard to meet to implement a regulatory standard. That's our point. The regulatory field here does not need to be read as expansively as the other side posits, because the FRA has all the authority it needs under the FRSA if it chooses to promulgate those rules, and it has not chosen to promulgate those rules. The FRA can use conflict pre-emption to displace any State rule, but what they are seeking to do is to take the doctrine of implied field pre-emption, gain immunity from State law liability, and not be subject to any Federal rules. And it's that proposition that is an extraordinary proposition of implied field pre-emption. We found no case from this Court that goes that far.",
  "If we lose this case, Justice Ginsburg, the decedent's family gets nothing, takes nothing, because the FELA claim was rendered summary judgment on the finding that there was no negligence by the railroad. The only claim that the decedent's family has here is a third-party claim against the manufacturer for failing to warn or design defect on the basis of State law.",
  "Well, here -- ordinarily, you'd bring a failure-to-warn claim directly against the manufacturer for not putting in the manual or stamping on the equipment - -",
  "-- or providing instructions for safe use.",
  "It's both.",
  "No. It's -- it's both. Manufacturers routinely are held liable for failing to warn if in their manuals or in their other instruction materials they do not provide for instructions for the safe use of their equipment. If I could save the balance of my time.",
  "Manufacturers clearly have the best information about the dangerous aspects of their products, and they issue warnings and instructions in manuals and provide all kinds of information so that persons working on their equipment are going to know the special hazards. It doesn't make sense to inoculate those manufacturers from liability where they have the best information to ensure that repair workers are not going to be exposed to risks. With respect to the point about being on the line, the whole idea behind the Locomotive Inspection Act was not just for use, Justice Kennedy, but also safe to operate on the railroad line. Under the regulations -- and this is well established -- yard limits are drawn outside the bowl where switching operations and repair operations occur, so that everybody knows where the Federal LIA standard applies and where it doesn't. And the reason why the LIA has had this kind of history with respect to repair work goes to the history of -- behind this Court's recognition of the commerce power. Up until the New Deal era, it was well settled that Congress could not legislate on intrastate activities, which are peculiar to repair yards. And so, this Court when it decided the Shanks case in the mid 1910s held that a railroad worker could not bring an FELA claim because his work was not in interstate commerce; it was only in intrastate commerce. And that is why the ICC throughout this entire period never devoted regulations to repair yards, because this Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence precluded Federal regulatory activity for that. So, if you look at this case from an historical perspective, Justice Kagan, it's not clear that the full parameters of the way the Court would explain Napier would be the same, because its approach to field pre-emption is so different after the New Deal era than it was before the New Deal era. And that is also why when this Court looks at regulatory implications of common law claims, it has had no problem allowing State law to have design defect claims with respect to planes, cars, motorboats, and trucks, even though the implications of a State law claim might find liability for the insufficiency of the design imposing an unreasonable risk to the person who is exposed to that risk with respect to that interstate modality. There's no reason why you have to have a broad and expansive view of the field here because Congress subsequently has enacted in this very area to give the Federal agency pre-emptive authority when it deems that authority appropriate. And as the Federal Government says - -",
  "It did so, though, Your Honor in 49 U.S.C. 20106, where it said that unless and until the Federal Government issues a regulation in a particular field, the States are allowed to have their rule be in effect.",
  "But that's why, Justice Ginsburg, the point here is how broadly do you define the scope of the field, and Napier defined it in an historical context that we just don't live in anymore. And there's no reason to give manufacturers a complete pass from liability when they have the best information to advise railroad -- railroads and railroad workers how to work on their equipment in a safe way without exposing their workers to unnecessary risks. Thank you.",
  "Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The City brought this In Rem action against Mr. Lozman's uninsured houseboat to enforce maritime liens. The houseboat was in violation of the wet slip agreement, and it posed a hazard to other vessels in the marina if, because of its flimsy moorings, it came unmoored during a storm. The houseboat was located very close to the navigable channel of the Atlantic Intercoastal Waterway and next to a yacht-building facility next to the marina. So the city faced a very real specter of being sued if the uninsured houseboat came unmoored and caused damage. Our position is that the houseboat is a vessel under section 3 because it floats, moves, and carries people or things on water, as the statutory - -",
  "No. An inner tube actually does not - -",
  "Well, a person actually - - most of the body parts of a person would be underwater and would be through the water, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "The test would be what's the practical capability, and a raft that has a bottom actually could very well be a vessel under the appropriate standard of practical capability.",
  "Cup is not because a cup doesn't float.",
  "Justice Kagan, I -- I think we could imagine all kinds of de minimis types of hypotheticals that would satisfy the basic criteria. But what the Court in Stewart said was practical capability as viewed in a real world sense. And I'm not aware of any case -- and they've certainly not pointed to anything -- that identifies anything with those kind of practical attributes that would be subject to litigation.",
  "You're -- yes. You're - - that is true in the sense that one of the purposes, as manifested through its physical characteristics, is the ability to be moved across water. And just as Mr. Lozman's houseboat here was moved 200 miles in the first towage after the hurricane wiped out every other vessel in the docks in the north bay marina, and he had it towed with a speed boat 70 miles to the city of Riviera Beach, those physical characteristics and attributes were recognized by the Court of Appeals when it applied the practical capability test. And it said on page 15(a) of the petition appendix that certainly living, a domicile, is a purpose of a floating home, but mobility is also a purpose, and then demonstrated that mobility here.",
  "Evansville is a case with many layers, but let me just start first start with the fact that the Court announced a practical capability test in Evansville itself. That's what it applied. It reviewed a district court record that had found no practical capability on the basis of the driveways and the more permanent connections to the utility system of the city, and it reviewed that factual record for clear error, which, of course, it didn't find, by - -",
  "No. In Stewart you said what the holding of the case was, which was that it was not practically capable of movement at the time that it sank. Now, I would like to just step back for a second because I think Evansville needs to be understood in the time in which it was decided. At that time, many courts, including this one, at times, applied a snapshot test, what is happening to this particular watercraft at the moment in time where an admiralty tort occurs, where the contract ensues, and the like. This Court subsequently disavowed the snapshot test; but, in Stewart, what the Court did was to describe Evansville and Cope as cases about not practically capable of movement or carriage because of their connections to the land. In Evansville, the owner of the wharf boat also owned the adjoining land and had control over the dock and built driveways so that trucks could come on and off, and had an eight-inch concrete lining on the houseboat which are not typically -- sorry, on the wharf boat, which are not typically attributes one would think of as ordinarily for vessels.",
  "I think it certainly did have that. It had that capability, Justice Breyer, because it was actually moved on multiple occasions.",
  "It was carrying his personal effects.",
  "It transported his computers; it transported his clothes. Except for the fact that his guns were confiscated before the marshals took it - -",
  "-- it was moved, that -- no, they're not part of the house. They're part of the personal effects, just as someone had personal effects in his or her dwelling. And when the marshal towed it, it carried two people as part of the crew for the transit between - -",
  "Well, actually, I think Mr. Fisher conceded that if this had a motor and it was carrying exactly the same personal effects, it would be a vessel.",
  "I think that a vessel that has practical capability, a watercraft that has practical capability to float, move and carry goods or people, that's a vessel.",
  "I think I've given up the absurd hypos because there are no litigation on them.",
  "Yes, if it has the practical capability. That's what the statute says, Justice Kagan. It depends on if you want to rewrite the statute to have subjective intent - -",
  "-- of lots of vessel owners.",
  "Justice Kagan, the fact that a vessel only moves once doesn't mean that it's not a vessel if it has -- if it meets the attributes of the statute, as explained by this Court in Stewart, of practical capability. The Titanic, of course, is a perfect example of that. The fact that a person may choose mobility as a -- as one of the attributes and not exercise that attribute of course goes to subjective intent, and as the Maritime Law Association's brief points out here, you do not want to apply an intent standard that goes to what the owner intends to -- which function the owner intends to exercise, because that leads to manipulation. And the casino - -",
  "Yes, but there are some exceptions and if -- I will let you finish your question.",
  "No. I would answer that question as no.",
  "No.",
  "Because it's a vessel and the exclusive admiralty jurisdiction of the United States courts means that it has to be litigated in the United States courts.",
  "That's why in the first one, if I could just explain about the State court, because I think that there is some misapprehension about what happened. His dog was not complying with the ordinances, and he was not complying with the city ordinances; that's why -- that's why the city brought the in personam action against him in State court. There was no admiralty basis there. He was still paying all of his dockage services and fees. It became an in rem action when the lien was not being discharged through his payment on the dockage fees, and the city had a basis under the wet slip agreement to assert a maritime lien, which is a classic admiralty action under Federal jurisdiction. So they are very different actions. Under the State court action he could still stay at the marina, but he had to be on a houseboat that complied with the marina's rules. He had two house boats at the marina, and this one was not in compliance, and that is why the city brought action against it. It was the only one of the 500-plus vessels and boats in this marina that wasn't in compliance with the rules.",
  "I think that sums up in a nutshell what we would regard as a proper statement of the law, of what this Court has already said, and that is that if it's got practical capability, those practical characteristics, Justice Kennedy, will manifest itself in the functions. If somebody wants to buy a domicile on land, one buys a house or a condo. If you buy a floating home, that has the attribute, the physical characteristics of floating, movage -- and moving and carriage - -",

And that's why when the normal definition of transportation is to convey a person or a thing from one place to another, that's perfectly satisfied under the facts of this case. And it is an undisputed record as Petitioner says, on page 27 of the cert petition, they ask for cert here for you to decide whether Mr. Lozman's state of mind about his indefinite mooring is somehow relevant to the definition of a vessel. It clearly isn't.",

  "And again - -",
  "Well, it would not be subject to towage. Here the houseboat had -- this is important because the houseboat under the testimony Mr. Lozman elicited at trial had four towing cleats that were welded into the structure of his houseboat so that it could be towed without torquing and twisting the houseboat and causing it to sink. The hypotheticals that the other side has suggested don't have that additive feature of towing cleats that are used for the purpose of being able to convey the houseboat - -",
  "Because the physical characteristics of this houseboat all point to the attributes of being a vessel. It floats, it moves, it carries. It's got nothing to do - -",
  "Well, Mr. Chief - -",
  "We would submit that Congress did not intend a you-know-it-when-you-see-it test. House barges, barges have been vessels since the time of Cleopatra. The fact that it is flat-bottomed and it floats and it moves and it carries things does not make it not a vessel.",
  "Yes, unless it has a physical impediment that takes it out of one of the three attributes that doesn't make it a vessel. If - -",
  "Yes.",
  "I'm not familiar - -",
  "We suggest that the way the court should think about that problem is as a physical impediment. Are physical impediments preclude its moat movement or carriage or floating capacity - -",
  "I think that's a fair way to view it, Justice Kagan, and it's a perfectly appropriate one. The Belle of Orleans case - -",
  "Well, I think that as a practical matter, this arises in only a couple of instances and those are the casino boats, many of which were vessels and they traversed the rivers allowing people to gamble because that's how state laws required them to perform. And they have since stopped trying to be vessels because of state law changes that they were able to make. And so the question as a practical matter is are there physical impediments to the ability of that boat to -- to use the capability to move? The Star of India, which was referenced in the Belle of Orleans case, was not -- was a vessel, a sailing vessel from the 19th century. In 1926 they took it out of commission as a sailing vessel and they towed it to San Diego, where it sat for 50 years tied to the dock, and for the bicentennial, they decided let's get the boat out and sail it and they sailed it for the bicentennial. The Ninth Circuit held that's a vessel because it has the capability of being used as a vessel. And the fact that something is moored for a long time, if it has the physical attributes to be a vessel, it is a vessel. The United States -- the USS Constitution, the famous USS Constitution would be shocked to have heard Mr. Gannon's statement about vessel because there are 200 Navy service members who service the USS Constitution and take it out periodically for sail.",
  "Yes - -",
  "If it were a problem the Coast Guard would have signed the Solicitor General's brief in this case which they have done in other cases in which transportation and vessel status have been relevant like in Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, United States v. Locke, in which the Coast Guard - -",
  "And the statute underlying those regulations, Justice Sotomayor, is found at 46 USC 4302, and it provides the secretary very broad discretion on what to include within the regulations and what not to. After this court decided the Stewart case, the secretary suspended many regulations for dockside vessels until the Coast Guard could issue new regulations. There is a hint, there is a suggestion that there might be a problem, but there is not anything that is really given in practical terms.",
  "No. And the reason why is because as this court recognized in Stewart, the in navigation requirement is something that has been used for limiting the reach of Jones Act seamen in those circumstances in which a vessel is taken out of navigation. So I think that it would be appropriate in a case like this where this is a classic instance of a maritime lien, dockage - -",
  "No. But no -- and in fact, I think the question of who is a Jones Act seaman is a different test that this Court last discussed in the Chandris case, in terms of its substantial connection to the mission of the vessel. And that -- I think that the Court could safely leave the Jones Act issues aside, because they bring in an entirely different regime that focuses on the worker's connection to the vessel as opposed to the definition of vessel itself. The definition of vessel itself here is, as Justice Scalia pointed out, part of the Dictionary Act, and it is something that does apply more broadly. But as we briefed in this case, there are two provisions that take that definition and then they add an intent requirement as specific language in different parts. So that if that idea, function, or intent or purpose is something that is germane to that particular statutory function, than that is a question that becomes a question for jurisdiction. But I'd also like to point out that both, I think, the district court and the court of appeals here assumed that there was jurisdiction here because there had not been evidence that contested the basic principles that the City brought when it profiled this in rem action. And because the case then moved into the merits phase, the district judge here initially denied the motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction without prejudice. And then as the evidence came in, revisited the question to provide a fuller explanation, and at that time made the ruling that Mr. Lozman had not put in record evidence that affected the practical capability of the test. The only thing Mr. Lozman argued in the court of appeals as a reason for error was that because he intended to live there indefinitely, even though he had no contractual or property right to do so, and he had signed a wet slip agreement that provided the marina complete discretion to move his houseboat within any of the slips, or to order of the houseboat to leave on 3 days' notice, the question of whether or not there was any record of evidence on practical capability got to the Eleventh Circuit, and the Eleventh Circuit, in applying a practical capability test, said the things that Mr. Lozman had argued, he didn't offer record evidence. So, Justice Kennedy, to your point, I think that with respect to the Court of Appeals and how it did do its job here is an important facet of the case as it comes. They initially asked you in the cert petition, grant cert because the Fifth Circuit and the Seventh Circuit have applied an onerous intent test. They've not defended that test. And it is abjectly erroneous because you can't have vessel status be so easily manipulated by an individual's intent. And now by trying to morph it into some kind of function or objective purpose standard, they've essentially done exactly what the Eleventh Circuit said they had offered no evidence in the district court to try to prove. If there are no further questions.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The class certification process determines whether the case can generate common answers for all class members. So for three reasons --",
  "Yes.",
  "There is a lot to said about Basic, and let me just start the ball rolling by making these observations. First, Basic did not try to distinguish between the requisites of Rule 23 and the substantive component of the fraud-on-the-market theory. And that's important because, in that case, the court remanded for a redetermination of materiality, but it upheld the class certification order. So in the context of Basic, the court seemed to be thinking there was a difference between what needed to be proved for class certification and what would need to be proved on the merits of the case. Now, the second thing to be said is that Basic needs to be read against the backdrop of Rule 23 and especially this Court's recent decision in Wal-Mart v. Dukes. Because materiality always generates a common answer for all class members, it is the quintessential common issue that does not splinter the class or cause it to be noncohesive for purposes of understanding predominance.",
  "Only in a hypothetical case, Justice Kennedy. And this is the absolute most important point that I can try to make today. In a fraud-on-the-market case, the idea of reliance -- the only theory of reliance that is being advanced is indirect reliance on the integrity of the market. There is no other theory of reliance. Why do we know that in this case? For two reasons: First, the Connecticut Retirement System could not be the class representative, if it did not meet the typicality requirement of Rule 23(a), which the district court found -- this is on page 25A of the petition appendix -- and has not been challenged subsequently. But why doesn't Connecticut have a direct reliance theory? We know they don't because they have a fiduciary duty to their investors to apply whatever theory they have of securities fraud. So we know in this case -- and this is, by far, clear in the run-of-the-mine fraud-on-the-market case, that the class representative will only establish reliance indirectly, by showing that the integrity of the market was impaired. And so their construct is an entirely hypothetical and theoretical one. It simply does not arise in the real world of fraud-on-the-market cases.",
  "Right, precisely because we have to know are all the investors standing in the same position. If the market is efficient and it is absorbing information into the price, all investors will have the same question with respect to materiality.",
  "They all lose on the merits, if there is no materiality. The question about efficiency, Justice Scalia, and the reason why it is advanced at class certification is because it serves a gatekeeping role in determining whether all the investors can show indirect reliance on the market. If the -- if the stock is thinly traded, there are no public analysts, there are no stock reports given about it, and no one knows exactly why is the price being determined, that creates exactly the kind of individual issues that would predominate in a securities fraud case.",
  "No, the question is: Does efficiency serve as a means of determining are all the investors similarly situated? Are they a cohesive class? If the market is not efficient -- and mind you, they -- they conceded this question in their answer and they did not challenge the expert that was put in the district court on the question of efficiency, so that question's really not in this case. But in the case that you're hypothesizing, Justice Scalia, efficiency serves the gatekeeping function of determining are all the investors similarly situated, so that indirect reliance can be a -- a method of showing that predicate for a common answer to be determined at trial.",
  "Publicity serves the same function.",
  "I think it -- where it gets appropriately done is the adequacy and typicality prongs of Rule 23(a) because that person has a different factual basis for attempting to assert a securities fraud, and that person is not typical of the class and so therefore would not meet the typicality requirement of 23(a). Now, it is possible, certainly, that in other cases, there might be investors out there who do have a direct reliance theory, but they are protected by Rule 23 in a couple of ways. One is they can bring their own case, and they can say, I directly relied on Amgen's misstatements and the false things that they said about their flagship products, and I, therefore, have my own 10b-5 case. Or if the class is certified and they think they have a direct reliance theory, they can opt out of the class.",
  "My direct answer to that is that materiality still serves as a common answer. All the investors are going to lose if it is not a material misstatement that has any effect, and they will win or they will have the potential to win if it is a material --",
  "Well --",
  "Right.",
  "But, Justice Scalia, I think that the issue that you want to decide or you think that you want to decide is what constitutes the efficiency of the market, and that is a hotly litigated issue in many securities cases. It just happens not to be at issue in this one. And so the question of -- you know, you've got a Fortune 200 company, with 1.1 billion shares outstanding, 9 million traded a day during the class period, I mean, this is a hugely efficient market for the stock that is at issue before you.",
  "Right. What you're ending up doing, Justice Breyer, is you are front loading. You are having a mini trial on the merits because the materiality question here goes into what did the executives think and mean when they were making certain statements about clinical trials for their drug. What was --",
  "No, what I'm saying is that it is -- because it is a common question, it is not one to be decided at class certification. Just like falsity --",
  "That's not our position. Our position is that efficiency and publicity are gate-keeping functions to determine whether or not the answer for indirect reliance on the market is a common question.",
  "Yes.",
  "It's a new concoction they had not argued before this stage of the briefing in this case, and it's wrong because all investors will rise or fall, based on whether or not those statements that may have some subsidiary materiality effect are going to be able to show that there was some consequence to the market. And it is that why -- that is why it is still a common question, even if there are these subsidiary inefficiencies --",
  "Correct.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Correct.",
  "That's correct. And Congress recognized that there were issues concerning these various elements. And that's why, in 1995, when it enacted the PSLRA, it addressed scienter by imposing a heightened pleading requirement and loss causation, but it was asked to address materiality and reliance and it chose not to. The first bill that was proposed would have dealt with Basic, and the -- and the Congress voted that down, and instead --",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, you would consign district court judges to having many trials on the merits because the fact that materiality is such a highly contextual inquiry --",
  "True.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, but that's where efficiency comes in, Justice Kennedy, and that's why, when efficiency is contested at the class certification stage, what comes in are proofs of does information end up having an effect? And economists do event studies that try to show the general level at which information will be absorbed into the market price. That's where that issue gets contested. It does not get contested on the question of materiality because materiality looks at the total mix of information that would be relevant to an investor, not --",
  "What I'm saying is that the efficiency question goes into the individual stock's ability to absorb information, both material and nonmaterial information. Now, the question on the merits, for which all investors will either rise or fall together, is was this company's misrepresentation a material one to the reasonable investor? And that's why all investors are going to have the same answer because it's the same objective inquiry. The question that you -- you and Justice Scalia are positing about the efficiency of the market is one on which there are disagreements among the lower courts as to how to challenge and how to deal with that question, but they do not do it on the basis of materiality. Judge Easterbrook had a very sound opinion in the Schleicher case, in which he goes through and he explains that, when there is a fraud-on-the-market case, the notion of indirect reliance, where efficiency is established, really evolves -- devolves down to the core merits question of materiality. And that is a common question that -- in which all of the investors are going to rise together. But I do want to end by saying that, when Congress looked at this question, it decided not to deal with this question of efficiency or materiality. It was faced with a specter of 300 lawsuits being filed per year that were securities fraud cases, in 1995, where a 93 percent settlement rate was occurring, an average settlement of nearly $9 million. In -- in 2011, the statistics showed that what Congress did was successful in achieving the purpose Congress attained. In the year 2011, there were 188 class actions filed; 50 percent of them were dismissed, mostly on the high-end pleading standards that Congress had enacted in the PSLRA. So it's not really for this Court's province to be imposing policy judgments about what additional requirements ought to be put on 23(b)(3); Congress made that judgment. And these proceedings that have gone along in -- in this way, were perfectly sound by -- both the district court and the court of appeals. If the Court has no further questions?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our position is that the stipulation is binding throughout the \"civil action filed by the putative class representative.\" I want to focus on the words \"civil action\" because there has been no civil action filed by any -- absent class members. The only civil action that the district court is being considered for jurisdiction is the civil action that has been filed by the putative class representative. So, if the class is later not certified, the stipulation would only bind the putative class representative. If the class is certified --",
  "No.",
  "What --",
  "And what 1332(d)(1)(B) does, Justice Kennedy, is define class action in terms of the civil action that was filed, so long as it was filed pursuant to Federal Rule 23 or an equivalent State statute. What the complaint here does in the prayer for relief, and in paragraph 11 of the complaint, is to say that this civil action is not going to be worth more than $5 million.",
  "Well, that would be one outcome that a State court could come to. A second outcome could be that at that point, if an alternate class member comes in and files an intervened complaint and says, this case really is worth $10 million, at that point section 1453(b) applies and they can remove to Federal court.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Well, what's very clear, Justice Scalia, is that Congress was not attempting to address the adequacy of class representation issue when it decided this statute and enacted it.",
  "A putative class representative makes all kinds of strategic judgments about how best to maximize value for his clients and for the class. And that entails judgments about whether to assert various legal theories. Here, and Mr. Chief Justice, this goes to your very first question, this complaint renounced a claim for punitive damages. But there are some cases out of the Tenth Circuit, the Frederick case, not associated with me, and in the Seventh Circuit, the Back Doctors case, they say essentially if there is a claim for punitive damages you have to make an estimate for amount in controversy purposes. As I understand their theory in -- as they express it on page 11 of the reply brief, it's very uncertain as to a case like ours where we have renounced a claim to punitive damages whether or not a Federal district court is, nonetheless, supposed to take that into account.",
  "Well, my objection would be at the class certification stage, Mr. Chief Justice, where the requisite of typicality, numerosity, the contrivances that are being done are -- are going to whether or not those represent -- representatives are adequate. It does not speak to Federal jurisdiction --",
  "I misunderstood, Mr. Chief Justice. I think that for Federal jurisdiction purposes, the Court has always had -- that kind of legal strategy is perfectly appropriate under the master of the complaint --",
  "Sure. Justice Breyer, if you look at the report that went along with the statute, what Congress was most concerned about was the situation where each individual class member would not be able to exceed $75,000, but there might be a million of them. And so you might have a million class members, each of whom had a claim for $50,000, and there was no way to get that to Federal court because of the Zahn non-aggregating rule. Congress was not concerned about having the master of the complaint altered in this class process; and, in fact, Congress rejected a proposal that would lower the amount in controversy for class actions to $2 million because the congressional budget office said, if you keep it at that low, virtually every class action will be in Federal court and Congress has not appropriated additional funds for the Federal courts to deal with all of the class actions that would occupy this space.",
  "And I'm telling you that his focus on the word \"claims\" is insufficient because there are no claims by absent members until there is a civil action that has been filed. And that is why if you look at the definition of a class action, it is a civil action that is filed pursuant to one of those rules.",
  "No, the 5 million --",
  "Well, Justice Alito, it means we have to determine, and the district court has to determine, whether or not the 5 million has been satisfied on the basis of the well pleaded complaint and an aggregation where, as a factual matter and as a stipulated matter in paragraph 11 of the complaint, the class representative here said, this case is not worth more than $5 million. And we know that that's true because even under their estimate of all of the class members in the State of Arkansas, the damages only equal about $3 million. And so --",
  "Not so long as there is a binding stipulation that says so long as this civil action is in place, it is not going to be worth $5 million.",
  "Yes. Well, Justice Breyer, Congress could have addressed any number of those kinds of issues with the specific terms that it used, but the well-pleaded complaint rule and the master of the complaint rule is a very subtle part of our diversity jurisdiction. And that is so because we want these jurisdictional inquiries to be simple, not complicated. Under their approach, they would take all the conceivable legal theories that might be brought over a -- conceivable period of time, and ask the district court to make very nuanced judgments about -- what --",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, let me try it this way, which is that for the large case, the one that I gave in my hypothetical where there are a million class members, and each of them has a claim of $50,000, we know that prior to CAFA, that case was staying in State court because of this Court's Zahn rule. But that might be a nationwide case. It might be worth hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. That was the kind of problem that Congress was trying to get at. But the case where there's a stipulation that actually might be meaningful, where the amount in controversy is debatable as to whether it's really $5 million, that's the kind of case where jurisdictional simplicity ought to encourage --",
  "That's correct because -- and Justice Ginsburg, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but that's precisely because we want the ability to make legal judgments and strategies to reside in the person who's bringing the complaint. We don't want --",
  "Not where there are allegations about what the aggregated damages are about. That's why -- to address this in the language of the civil action, those absent class members haven't filed any lawsuit. We don't really know what claims they might conceivably bring if they are were to be hypothesized. What we do know is that there is a civil action, it has been filed by a putative class representative, that putative class representative in good faith, the district court found had acted in good faith in stipulating to a lower amount than $5 million -- and the question is should that be given legal effect, where everybody knows it will be binding if the class is certified, and it will be binding on the class representative if the class is not certified.",
  "Well, you were referring to a statute, Justice Alito, that was recently enacted, in which it does say that the presumption shall be that the amount pleaded in the complaint is subject to disproval. But that's reversing 200 -- well, 100-plus years of settled removal law, after the reforms of the 1870s created the removal jurisdiction the way it is more currently constructed. And so in that interregnum between the 1870s and that statute passed just a couple of years ago, the rule was well-settled that the individual case pleading amount was fine. And under St. Paul Mercury, if there was a stipulation that had been filed contemporaneously with the complaint or prior to removal, that that would be given legal effect. Here, the stipulation was filed with the complaint. There is no doubt that this was done in good faith. The district court found that -- and I don't think that's really an even arguable proposition here, where they were asserting a 40 percent attorney's fee on this -- and so really the question is, where you have an aggregated estimate, should that be given legal effect.",
  "Well, as a policy matter, we might have a debate about the various virtues of that, but they were not enacted in the same piece of legislation. So what we do know is that for CAFA, Congress had not adopted the rule that you're positing. Nonetheless, we do not attempt to argue that they have no basis for making arguments about amount of controversy when they remove, but it is subject to the rule that a binding stipulation shall be given binding effect in the civil action that has been filed. And if that is later proved to be inadequate --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, this is important that you and I understand each other on this point because it is binding in the civil action filed for all purposes. So whoever is covered by that civil action will forever be bound by the $5 million stipulation. What we do not know is who will be members of that class until the certification hearing is done. Whoever ends up being covered by that civil action will forever be bound by that stipulation. That is what the district court knows.",
  "Well, for two reasons, because there are protections that are in the statute that protect both defendants and absent class members. And the protection for the absent class members is it that if that stipulation is insufficient to adequately represent their interests, the district court, the trial court and State court will not certify the class.",
  "And -- and as a matter of judicial estoppel, what is absolutely clear in every State that I am familiar with is that it follows this Court's basic formula in New Hampshire v. Maine, which looks at whether or not a change in position would prejudice the interests of the other party if the Court had relied on the original position of the litigant, and that will estop that person. Now, it may -- it may well be that there are due process issues associated with class representative and the adequacy of a class representative is a continuing concern throughout a litigation precisely because of due process concerns.",
  "Actually, I think Mr. Chief Justice, with all due respect, the economic incentives are completely reversed because if a class representative is bound by a stipulation that this case is not worth than $5 million, the bidding starts at 5 million, but it goes down, it doesn't go north because the defendant knows that no matter whether we go to trial or not, this case, this case -- this civil action is only going to be worth $5 million.",
  "Well, certainly, Mr. Chief Justice, Congress could have drafted a statute that allowed for the removal of every State class action and dealt with that issue if it was deemed appropriate to have Federal courts decide all class actions, but that wasn't the statute that Congress enacted. And Congress also could have expressed concerns and difficulty with this idea of having the Master of the Complaint Rule applied in the class action context, but it didn't address that either. And so when Congress is only addressing a very narrow problem of dealing with the non-aggregation principle so that class actions that were worth more than $5 million would be allowed to be removed to Federal court, I don't think it would be appropriate for the Court to try to infer a larger set of --",
  "Well, these kinds of stipulations are well known and in fact, as we quote on, I think it's page 5 of our brief, Congress was aware of factual stipulations. They concede in their reply brief that it's perfectly fine for their to be a joint stipulation between the putative class representative and the defendants. And, yet, I would think that that would raise even more problems and concerns by you because that would lead to the kind of collusion between a putative class representative and the defendant without knowing what the other interests of the absent class members are. And so here, where a good faith effort is made to quantify the aggregate claims and that good faith effort leads to the stipulation that the case will not be worth more than $5 million, the interests of jurisdictional simplicity, the interest of fairness to the class members, the interest of understanding what the civil action is all about so that the defendant is on notice about what will be claimed in this civil action are all things that should be given respect.",
  "Well, there are two tools that -- that we describe in our brief and that I think are reasonable ways that Federal courts address these matters. One is to look at whether or not it violates Rule 11 and there are -- there's a frivolous assertion of a stipulation, which Federal district judges deal with Rule 11 motions all the time. The second is the concept of good faith, which is what St. Paul Mercury addressed when it said that a stipulation for less than the jurisdictional amount, if made in good faith, is something that will be treated as dispositive for jurisdictional purposes.",
  "No. If I'm understanding Justice Breyer's hypothetical, it's at the amount of controversy stage and so there is litigation at that stage and the defendant presumably would bring to the judge's attention, I think this is being done in bad faith and I have these arguments for why this is deceiting -- deceitful, misleading, et cetera.",
  "No, I don't think so because there are lots of tactical reasons why litigants might want to limit their claims or might have a good faith basis for saying, I've only investigated this time period, I do not have a good faith basis for asserting claims in a different time period that I have not investigated that does not serve the court.",
  "Well, the -- the -- the notion that I have distilled from St. Paul Mercury and the idea of good faith and looking at cases that have addressed bad faith, which is obviously the converse of good faith, is whether or not there is something misleading or deceitful in the way that this stipulation would be framed. And I think that that is as good a guidance as I can give you absent briefing.",
  "There -- there could be a strategic reason, Justice Sotomayor, why --",
  "Well, but there are reasons because, in Arkansas, for instance, there is a direct appeal for the State supreme court. We could finish this case in many fewer years than it would take to wind its way up through the Eighth Circuit and up to this Court. That is one salutary reason. The second is we're talking about State law claims that are breach of contract claims for a State-regulated industry. The State insurance board would be looking at how State insurance is done here. So there are very good reasons why a -- why a lawyer would want this case to be in State court and not want it to be removed to Federal court wholly apart from the ad hominem attacks that they make about Miller County, which were not brought to Congress's attention and in fact are false. As we have put into amicus briefs, it is false. The arguments that they talk about abuse involve all cases that predated CAFA.",
  "Because these are Texarkana lawyers who filed on behalf of all Arkansas residents and Texarkana, Arkansas is a jurisdiction in Arkansas.",
  "Well --",
  "Sure. In his hypothetical, that's true under Federal rules, too. If you're applying Federal Rule 23 and you have a large number of class members and the case gets settled for X dollars, the individual class member is held to the duty of deciding whether to opt out because that individual class member thinks I may have been able to get more than what is being offered in this class settlement or to attack the adequacy of the representation because the aggregate amount is not high enough. It's a problem that applies in both Federal and in State court. It's not unique to State court at all. If the Court has no further questions, we'll submit.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start with the questions that you and Justice Alito posed about State law because it's important to understand, before you have impossibility conflict preemption, to understand what the State duty is here. I think it was conceded that it would not be impossible to have an absolute liability regime. So the question here is because New Hampshire actually makes it somewhat easier for manufacturers to evade liability, that that somehow creates a different kind of preemption problem. We would submit that it doesn't. What the State law is seeking to do here, Mr. Chief Justice, is to impose liability where there is proof of an unreasonably dangerous product. That unreasonable danger entails evidence of a risk/benefit analysis that looks at the overall risks to the population against the overall benefits that are provided to the drug.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Yes, it is. And notably, the FDCA doesn't preclude that. Wyeth v. Levine affirms that principle. And what's important here is that under State law, there's not a duty to change the design or to change the label. It is, Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, exactly as you postulated, that if there is an unreasonably dangerous drug, that the people that are harmed egregiously, like Karen Bartlett, will have an opportunity to compensation --",
  "Well, of course, Mr. Chief Justice, Mutual put in their defense in this case -- they rested after the plaintiffs put in their case. So it's not to say that in another case, they wouldn't have an opportunity to prove that there is some benefit of their drug.",
  "Well, there's no claim preclusion effect of a jury verdict, and that is why there is no offensive collateral estoppel that would be applied, Mutual can adopt a different trial strategy. It is often the case, Mr. Chief Justice, that in these kinds of cases, the defense applies different tactics to how they defend this case. In this particular case, they chose to waive their comment k affirmative defense. They chose not to put in any affirmative evidence itself. They chose after the trial in their Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law not to challenge the warning instructions that were given to the jury -- as Judge Boudin noted and as the district court noted -- they had waived their preemption warning argument. And so what they seek to do here after not being able to show, which they cannot show under New Hampshire Supreme Court precedent, Vautour and Kelleher, cases that we cited in our brief, that New Hampshire imposes any duty to change any conduct by the manufacturer whatsoever.",
  "Let me address that because I think that's the hardest part of this case to understand, and why this is different from Mensing. In a strict liability case in New Hampshire, the warning is not relevant as a -- as an element of the claim. What the jury is required as an element of the claim is to prove unreasonable dangerousness. And District Judge La Plant, who presided over this very complex and difficult trial with a lot of skill, understood the difference between the concept of adequacy of a warning which describes the risks and efficacy of the warning which limits or minimizes the risks. And all over the pretrial instructions, he made very clear to the counsel, you are not to argue about adequacy of the warning because that goes to the comment k defense that they waived on the eve of trial. Instead, once the jury finds that the drug is unreasonably dangerous, it may use the warning as a way to limit or minimize the risk. In other words, the warning could only benefit Mutual because liability was going to be found in spite of the warning and not because of the warning.",
  "It is not.",
  "No, absolutely not, Justice Breyer. The evidence here was clear. No warning would have made any difference to lessening the risk. And that is because, and this is on --",
  "All that they -- in terms of minimizing the risk. Justice Breyer, here --",
  "The case as it was litigated up until the day before the trial was with a comment k defense, which allows as an affirmative defense the defendant to say if the drug is unavoidably unsafe and it has an adequate warning, i.e. it adequately describes what the risks are, complete immunity from suit. They abandoned that comment k defense on the eve of trial. And so as the judge understood and instructed the jury, the only role that the warning actually played was whether it could lessen the risk to patients who took the drug, i.e. in the risk/benefit analysis, it's somewhat less risky in weighing it against the benefits.",
  "That's correct, that's correct. And as the Le Blanc case held in the New Hampshire Supreme Court, the New Hampshire law treats failure to warn cases as distinct from design-defect cases. Here, no words would have made any difference because the scientific --",
  "Yes.",
  "Where is it in the record?",
  "Well, I would direct you to two --",
  "-- two pieces. The JMOL order that the judge issued, which is in the petition appendix, goes through this very clearly. And Judge Le Plant understood how the different roles of warning apply, and he instructed the jury, and this is in the pre-formal colloquy that he's giving to the jury orally, you can find this at 496 of the Joint Appendix where he says, \"Adequacy is not an issue for -- the adequacy of the warning is not an issue for you to decide.\" He then goes further to explain that \"You will only consider the warning after you have considered the unreasonable danger\" -- that's at 513 to 514, and then on page 516 of the Joint Appendix, he says, \"You only consider the warning to minimize the risk,\" i.e. to benefit Mutual in the assessment of whether or not in a risk/benefit analysis this drug has greater risks than --",
  "Justice Breyer, a chemotherapy drug has got a huge benefit. It potentially saves you from cancer. A nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, of which there were 16 other types, is not at all analogous to a chemotherapy drug.",
  "But that's why when the jury gets evidence that aspirin and acetaminophen, Tylenol produce the same kind of pain relief, but they do not produce the kind of SJS/TEN that Ms. Bartlett -- that caused 60 percent of her body to burn. I mean, that gives you a very clear contrast.",
  "No, because the evidence at the time of approval had not yet been ascertained. What was clear from the unpublished Pharmacia report that went into evidence in this case was that between the time of 1980 and 1997, the adjusted reporting rate of these adverse incidents went very high, and it was of a rate that was comparable to Bextra, which went on the market several years after that study ended, in which the FDA, in looking at a comparable adjusted adverse reporting rate, concluded should be taken off the market.",
  "That is true, but what the FDA did not take into account, and this is what the district judge instructed the jury on September 22nd, 2010, I think it's page 108 in the charging colloquy, is the evidence in this case was that the FDA did not have that evidence. So what the Solicitor General seeks to argue here is evidence that was not in the record and in which Mutual's own expert who created this evidence testified in deposition he didn't give it to the FDA. And then Mutual never put him on the stand to be cross examined. And so now what we have is a trial record that shows this evidence was not given to the FDA at all.",
  "That is incorrect. That the FDA, if it considered it, there is no record of it doing so because in the response to the 2005 citizen petition and in a later memorandum, it never mentions sulindac. So if you are to take any kind of regulatory preemption here, it surely has to be on the basis of a considered action that the FDA takes after notice and comment rulemaking. That was the kind of standard that was advocated in the concurring opinion in Wyeth v. Levine, that is absent here. And, in fact, this case has even a weaker case for that kind of considered and rejected than in Levine itself where there was evidence that Phenergan had caused some arterial exposure.",
  "You can do that. Yes, Justice Kennedy, you can do that. It is a factor for the jury to consider. It is not an element of the claim. And what PLIVA makes clear --",
  "The warning can be a factor. What that --",
  "And Justice Kennedy --",
  "Yes, it was relevant as in this case. But, Justice Kennedy, if you were to take the position that mere evidence that is a factor for the jury to consider, even though there is no need to change any legal duty, you would be adopting field preemption under this statute because the whole thrust of PLIVA --",
  "No. And let's be clear on our nomenclature here. A duty is a legal requirement imposed under State common law, a duty to use due care, a duty to change the label, which is what was conceded in PLIVA and Mensing. Here New Hampshire law does not require a duty to change the label or to change the design. All it does, Justice Kennedy, is to say, if the jury finds that the risks outweigh the benefits, it may consider whether the warning would have lessened the risk.",
  "Well, when there is a comment k defense, Mr. Chief Justice, you may be off completely. And that's why the role of comment k is so critical in these strict liability claims. All --",
  "There is a difference, and the difference is this, assume in the Diana Levine case there had been a strict liability claim that went all the way through. The question under a strict liability law would be would a -- would -- did the warning lessen the risk that she would have had gangrene and amputation of her arm? The adequacy of the warning under a strict liability law simply goes to did the manufacturer adequately describe the risks that the patient might incur. In the Levine case it very well might have been that the warning adequately describes that there's a possibility of gangrene, but it didn't do enough to lessen the risk that she would sustain. And because there was a way to change the label to lessen that risk, she got a judgment for a failure to warn. Because the manufacturer's conduct was such that it could have improved the label. Here we acknowledge and the evidence shows there is no way to change the label here. Some -- some -- some number of people, maybe some in this room, might take sulindac and get SJS/TEN. We don't know who they are, and we can't write words that would tell anyone in this room, you have a lesser chance of getting that horrible disease.",
  "Let's be clear, Justice Breyer. There is a difference between the application of impossibility preemption, which I don't think anybody here can argue with a straight face that simply paying a judgment in strict liability is impossible in light of the Federal regime, an obstacle preemption. Now, it may well be that there could be cases out there like your life-saving type drug, which by the way has a special regulation under a special statute to ensure that that is on the market, and some other drug where the risk/benefit equation is -- is such. But surely in our system we have to trust district judges to be able to grant or deny judgments as a matter of law, where they conclude that the evidence would not be sufficient to show that the risk outweighed the benefit. And here, the judge made very clear that because Mutual had not put in any evidence of the benefit of its drug at all and arguably couldn't have done so because this drug is like aspirin -- except that it causes these horrific injuries -- it's reasonable to suppose that a jury which can decide misbranding actions under the FDCA, and that has been acknowledged by the majority in Wyeth v. Levine, can make the very same risk/benefit safety determination that Justice Thomas in his concurring opinion said also is -- enabled the States to make. The States are not precluded under the FDCA from making that kind of judgment. So in the hard case, Justice Breyer, there is a mechanism for preemption. The FDA has to act. It has to act pursuant to notice and comment rulemaking. It has to identify which drugs it thinks would not be subject to these kinds of strict liability claims, but it hasn't done that here. All it's done is to say, we happen to have some evidence in our files, ergo preemption. Well, preemption doesn't work like that under the Supremacy Clause.",
  "Yes.",
  "It is. The label changed after Karen Bartlett sustained the injuries that she did in this case. In fact, that was one of the arguments that -- that at the time, this was before PLIVA, okay? So there was a lot of failure to warn being argued because the regime, as the case came into trial was under Wyeth v. Levine, it was not under the PLIVA v. Mensing case. So Justice Kagan, that's why it's perfectly reasonable for the trial lawyers here to think that the warning is an appropriate thing because this Court's case that had just been decided made that perfectly clear. But what was interesting here was that Judge La Plant made a very clear distinction between the role that the warning would play, appropriately so, under a strict liability regime. Now, I would like to note that the avocado case is one that did not entail the State banning avocado sales. Judge Boudin is absolutely right when he says that there is nothing under the FDCA to preclude the State from making a reasonable safety determination that might lead to the withdrawal of the drug. Now, admittedly, that is a rare circumstance. And that is not what New Hampshire is doing here, and in his post-trial orders Judge La Plant made clear that is not what New Hampshire is imposing here. All New Hampshire is imposing here is a duty to pay compensation if your unreasonably dangerous product harms a patient.",
  "No, because the -- the duty here, if there is any duty to stop selling under New Hampshire law, it can be complied with by not selling the drug. There's nothing in Federal law that requires or mandates the sale of these drugs.",
  "Yes.",
  "It would be very dangerous.",
  "Well, it would be dangerous to try comply with both at the same time. But certainly if --",
  "Yeah. If the difference -- right. But the difference, Justice Alito, is what is the content of the substantive duty. If the content of the substantive duty is you -- the State says to do one thing and the Feds say do the opposite, that's impossibility conflict.",
  "Right, but our position, Justice Scalia, is if you that follow PLIVA to what it says in its logical extension, you look at the -- you look at the content of the duty there, the content of the duty was to change the label. What the majority opinion says is that Minnesota and Louisiana law said you must change the label and the Federal government says, you cannot change the label. So here --",
  "Actually we dispute what they say, and we've got an -- an excursus about Mensing in our brief, and what is clear is that as the case came to this Court, the only duty that was being litigated was the duty concerning the warning label. There was not a strict liability claim in the sense of a design defect. Mind you, there are strict liability claims in -- in failure to warn as well. That is essentially what comment k gets at. This case however, was tried as a design case only, and the State law duty made very clear there was no duty to change the design of the drug. And so therefore, under Mensing, there can't be impossibility because State law is not telling you --",
  "Justice Breyer, that's not an impossibility hypothetical. That's an obstacle hypothetical. And in Wyeth, I think six justices said there is no obstacle under the FDCA of having State law remedies to compensate injured patients. So you know, the reason why it's important to keep these concepts of preemption distinct is that they ask you to grant cert on whether or not it is impossible to comply in light of PLIVA, which was an impossibility preemption case. That was not an obstacle preemption case. Now, having -- you know, I think gotten a deeper view of what State law requires, they're seeking to shift the case into an obstacle case, and virtually all of the Federal government's arguments here are obstacle-type arguments. It is because the FDA is so expert that it has this information in its files and that that should therefore negate and displace and nullify State law, which is a rather sweeping proposition.",
  "Granted --",
  "Yes, yes. Our position, and we -- we -- we made this clear that all they were asking in the cert petition was for an impossibility look at PLIVA. The obstacle argument has been waived in our view of the way this Court ordinarily takes certiorari cases and then decides them. So -- and on the impossibility point, I think that our position is clear. Now, Justice Kagan, the very first question out of the box was does this rule that they're advocating apply to brand name drugs and the answer unfortunately is yes. Because the premise of their argument is that simply because the FDA approved the drug and there would need to be some State law claim that would give rise to some alteration, that that necessarily would mean that it would be impossible to comply with. And so that applies to brand name drugs as well as generic drugs. We don't see a principal difference, unfortunately, to distinguish them. There may be some difference in certain State laws. I don't want to speak for all 50 States, but the basic gist of their argument is FDA approval über alles.",
  "No, the FDA requires a -- a new drug or an abbreviated drug application, I get the terms of them sometimes confused, but if there was to be a tweak to the design, they'd need to go to the FDA to get approval for that. I want to make one other point, which is that strict liability applies to distributors as well as to manufacturers. And so here it seems obvious that a distributor can't change the design and it cannot change the label. But under normal principles of strict liability, the idea is that if you are a seller of the product in your normal course and it is a dangerous product that causes somebody to be injured, you can be held liable in strict liability. That principle is very well settled. And so it would seem odd to suppose that the distributor who has no power to make any change in conduct that would make the product any safer also gets to be immunized from suit. I have no further points unless the Court has further questions.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I've never been in a case in my time arguing before this Court where somebody in a reply brief at the merits put in evidence that they did not put in at trial and they sought to persuade you that that was somehow relevant. Number 2, the issue here concerns sulindac manufactured by all the different manufacturers of sulindac, not just Mutual. Number 3, we never have seen that information. It was never served on us. We have no way to test it. I have no idea whether it is accurate or not. Number 4, if they are only making $7 million, they ought to withdraw from the market because their -- their product causes such horrific injuries it ought not to be sold. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I want to address the cable question, but before I do that, can I just say the three points I wanted to make are the text is very clear for Aereo, the interpretations of the text that they offer absolutely threaten cloud computing, and third, this case is really a reproduction right case masquerading as a public performance case. Now, we are not a cable service. The reason we're not a cable service is because cable takes all signals and pushes them down. There's a head in. It's defined by statute. There's a very particularized regulatory structure that deals with taking a lot of content and pushing it down to consumers. Aereo is an equipment provider. Nothing happens on Aereo's equipment until a user initiates the system. The user initiates the system by logging on and pressing this is the program that I want to watch. That then tunes the antenna, activates the recording that will be made, and then the user is then able to play back that recording.",
  "Well ­­",
  "Sure.",
  "Well, your hypothetical, Justice Sotomayor, implicates the reproduction right. That is the exclusive right of the copyright holder to restrict the number of copies that is made. That is not a public performance right question. They abandoned their challenge in the preliminary injunction proceeding to the reproduction right issue because it runs right into the Sony decision. In Sony, this Court held that consumers have a fair use right to take local over­the­air broadcasts and make a copy of it. All Aereo is doing is providing antennas and DVRs that enable consumers to do exactly what this Court in Sony recognized they can do when they're in home and they're moving the equipment, the antennas and the DVRs ­­",
  "­­ to the Internet.",
  "Let me ­­ this is a very complex question, Justice Ginsburg, and let me answer it at multiple levels. There are technical reasons why the individual antennas provide the same utility at lower costs and functionality than one big antenna. But there are very practical concerns, too. As a startup business, Aereo is attempting to entice consumers to replicate on the cloud what they can do at home at lower cap costs and more efficiency. As a practical matter, and Judge Chin had no basis in which to make this statement at all in his dissent because these are facts not on the record and efficiency is not a consideration under the Copyright Act, you can't do multiple channels over the Internet anyway. You can only do a single video stream at a time. So whether you have one big antenna or whether you have lots of little antennas, you still have to compress the signal and only one can go over the Internet at a time. However, Justice Ginsburg, as a startup business, there is a very real consideration for why multiple antennas make sense. If you're in New York City, you want to put an antenna on top of the building, you've got to get a building permit. If you want to construct it, you've got to get a construction permit. If you want to put it up there with a crane, you have to get a subway permit before you can do all of the things to put a big antenna on a building in New York City to get broadcast signals.",
  "Well, the point of the copyright laws, though, Your Honor, shouldn't turn on the number of antennas. It turns on whether the person who is receiving the signal that comes through the Internet is privately performing by initiating the action of that antenna getting a data stream, having that signal compressed so that it can be streamed over the Internet through a user­specific, user­initiated copy.",
  "We understood ­­ yes, there is a reason, Justice Scalia. We wanted to tell consumers, you can replicate the experience at very small cost. You know you have a right to put an antenna on your roof and put a DVR in your living room. We can provide exactly the same antenna and DVR for a fraction of cost by putting it over the cloud.",
  "Well, some of the consumers do. The record is clear that some are statically assigned to particular users. But Mr. Chief Justice, that doesn't answer the question, the statutory interpretation question, which is, as in CableVision, as Justice Kennedy noted, there is a user­specific, user­initiated copy that when viewed by the user is a private performance. That operation of the system works exactly the same way. And the fact that CableVision is able to compress its signals to make them Internet­accessible through a single antenna and Aereo chooses to do it through multiple antennas to avoid all the hassles that go with having a big antenna should not matter for the copyright laws. We're still talking about renting equipment, that consumers have a right to get over­the­air signals that are free to the public, using public spectrum that the ­­ that the government has allocated so that broadcasters ­­",
  "That would probably violate the reproduction right, Justice Kennedy. It would not violate the public performance rights.",
  "Aereo would not be a performer. The question would be ­­ and this does go into the technical details. And here, the position between the parties is quite stark. They say the facts don't matter. We have a well­developed factual record. There, Justice Kennedy, the fact that would matter in your hypothetical would be whether or not the initiation of the advertiser­free had been somehow done by the consumer or whether it had been done by the cloud provider.",
  "Right. I understand ­­",
  "Because the ­­ the action of who is a performer turns under the statute on who is making ­­ who is acting to make the sequence of sounds and images perceivable. Where you're talking about taking out advertising, what you're doing is you're altering the copy, and you are abridging, infringing, the reproduction right. That is not something that you can do in the Aereo technology. I have no brief to defend that. That would be a very difficult reproduction right question. But it doesn't matter in terms of who is exercising a private performance, because that is being done in the home with a user­initiated, user­specific copy.",
  "Yes.",
  "Possibly.",
  "It can't be used for distance, but it implicates ­­",
  "No, because HBO is not done over the airwaves. It's done through a private service. But Justice Scalia, let me answer your distant signal hypothetical this way. That would implicate again the reproduction right. It does not implicate the private performance and public performance distinction, because, even if you were to take distant signals and make them available in the home, it's still through a user­initiated, user­specific copy of distant programming. The question then becomes, is there a fair use right to be able to do that. What Sony said, because Sony was dealing with local over­the­air broadcasts and making a copy of local over­the­air broadcasts, it said that consumers have a fair use right to make a copy of that. Sony did not address the distant signal, and the question then would become in balancing the various fair use factors whether it was appropriate for a consumer to be able to get access to that programming without being able to otherwise implicate the free public spectrum. Now, the way Congress has addressed that, Congress has addressed that by saying that when there are distance signals that then get pushed through a cable system, there is a copyright royalty that gets paid. But I want to make absolutely clear. Satellite, cable, do not pay copyright royalties for local over­the­air broadcasts. Why? Because the local over­the­air broadcast channels wanted it that way. They didn't want to be in a situation of having to figure out how to divvy up all the copyright royalties to the various holders. So when they talk about how Congress supposedly overruled Fortnightly, what they ignore is that in Section 11(d) and in Section 122(c) of the Copyright Act, Congress said the retransmission of local over­the­air broadcasts through satellite and cable shall be exempt from the copyright regime. And so when they talk about the retransmission issue, they're really trying to conflate a totally different regulatory system ­­",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, the person who sells an antenna to me at the local Radio Shack doesn't pay copyright royalties either. And a ­­ and a company that provides a rental service for me to put an antenna in my home and install it, they don't pay copyright royalties either. And the question that it really boils down in this case is how significant should it be how long the cord is between the antenna and the DVR being ­­",
  "Well, let me address ­­ I think I ­­ let me try to make it their problem.",
  "I think I've addressed the distant signal, and I think you can reserve that case to say that might raise a different issue, but on the facts here would not entitle the company to an injunction enjoining Aereo from providing the service. Now, with respect to the second aspect of this, the reason why their interpretation of the Transmit Clause causes so much problem, so many problems for the cloud computing industry, is that ­­ is twofold. Number one, they are conflating performance with work in the Transmit Clause. What they are saying is that, so long as the work is always perceived in some fashion through a performance that is privately done through the playback of a recording, that that ­­ because the initial work was disseminated to the public, that implicates the public performance right. What that does is it means that every time somebody stores something in the cloud, whether it's a song, a video image or ­­ or the like, if it happens to be something that somebody else has stored in the cloud, the act of one person initiating it and perceiving it is going to implicate the public performance right. And that's why the cloud computing industry is freaked out about this case because they've invested tens of billions of dollars on the notion that an user­specific, user­initiated copy when perceived by that person is a private performance and not a public performance. The second thing that they do that's wrong with the statute is they aggregate performances. Instead of where the statute says \"transmit a performance,\" they say \"transmit performances.\" Because they acknowledge that the way the technology works for Aereo is that it is an individual, user­specific, user­initiated copy. But they say no matter if you add enough of them together, you can aggregate that to become a public performance.",
  "Well, that's where the issue about replicating what happens in the home matters, Mr. Chief Justice, because if I'm in my home and I start the program two minutes in, using Aereo's technology, I missed the first two minutes, I never get to watch it. It happens to be when I push the button to initiate the copy, just like if I'm at home watching on a DVR, the same principle. And so that copy will always be different because I have control over it versus ­­",
  "But that is ­­ that is the key distinction between video on demand and the service that Aereo provides, the kinds of equipment and technology that Aereo provides. We don't have a brief to defend the master copy because in the master copy situation, that is indisputably public because there is no right to exclude anyone else. With Aereo's technology, if I'm making a copy using Aereo's system, no one else can look at it. Even if you happen to have watched the same program, you can't watch my copy, I can't download it ­­",
  "Correct.",
  "It is much simpler if you're a start­up to add components, to add modules when you're starting up, ramping up. And what we're talking about in any cloud computing industry is you're starting with one group of servers and then you add them, almost like Lego pieces, as you are adding the number of people that you're using. That is a technological reason why the cloud works the way it does, Mr. Chief Justice. So with Aereo's antennas and its DVRs, we can, with about the length of the size of this counsel table here, service tens of thousands of people in the New York area. We can provide the antennas and we can provide the DVRs and it's a very compact, small space. And then if we expand and we're able to continue to be in business and we get more subscribers in Brooklyn, we might add another row that would be the size of ­­ of the counsel tables behind me. That aspect of the technology goes to the modules that are used for cloud computing where you basically can add additional servers, add additional hard disk space and then when new consumers activate ­­ and let me just be clear about this, when they sign up, their system is completely empty. There's no content being provided. There's equipment that's being provided. So when they activate the system and they say, I want to watch the news at 6 o'clock, they then start the process that then fills their individually assigned storage with the 6 o'clock news. But until that happens, there's no content being provided. So the notion that they have in their reply brief over and over that we're somehow a content provider would mean that everybody who provides an antenna or a DVR is somehow a content provider. And if that's true, then the implications for the equipment industry are obviously quite massive and you can understand why that would frighten the cloud computing industry because that turns them into public performers whenever they are handling content. Now, the government says ­­",
  "It's no different, Justice Ginsburg, than if I'm at home and I have an antenna or rabbit ears on my TV and I know what channels I can get.",
  "Right. But the menu, Justice Kagan and Justice Ginsburg, is simply what is technologically available. There are broadcast signals that are available in a local area, and they are limited because that's what the broadcasters make available. And simply providing a user guide that says you can tune to this channel or you can tune to that channel, if you want to pick up one program or another, can't be the difference between a content provider and merely ­­ merely facilitating the use of your equipment.",
  "I think that your argument, Justice Breyer ­­",
  "Let me ­­ okay. Let me try to correct this. There is no compulsory license with respect to music or video. There are different compulsory licenses with respect to satellite and cable that capture all signals and push them down to everyone.",
  "No. Where it's going to be a problem with the cloud is if you say ­­ if I'm watching a particular program and you're watching a particular program and Justice Sotomayor is watching the same program, we are engaging ­­ and the company that has allowed us to make a copy of that is engaging in public performance. Where you have to deal with infringement is the concept of ­­ of volition and the idea of who is doing the act. If I'm simply making equipment available, then ­­",
  "But let me ­­ let me ­­ let me further answer your question about music, because I omitted a key distinction, which is that for local radio broadcasts, there is a music distribution license. It's under Section 115 of the Copyright Act.",
  "Right. But that's the whole ­­ that is exactly the same way satellite and cable work, as well. So that if you're broadcasting in the local area, it is for free. It is like a copyright­free zone. And the reason for that in the music world is because they want local radio broadcasters to play songs because that drives sales of the records. That's a totally different business model, of course, than in the television world. But the reason why this matters for your perspective is that what the court ­­ the Second Circuit in CableVision did was it said user­specific, user­initiated copies are private performances. They are not public performances. And the only way ­­",
  "Yeah. The difference is that they do not exclude anyone. And the difference ­­ the public­private distinction from property law is whether or not there's a right to exclude. If I have private property, I exclude others. If I have public property, I'm not excluding others. Netflix, Hulu, those other services, they're not excluding anyone. As a user of those services, I have no right to exclude anyone else. And so they are making their product, their content available to all without exclusion other than the subscription that you pay. What we're doing is providing the equipment that enables people to access it.",
  "Sure. And if we went around to a 1,000 or 10,000 homes in Brooklyn and we put up antennas, installed their DVRs for them, and we sent them a monthly bill every month to pay us because we had performed that service and provided that equipment, it would be the exact same position, Justice Ginsburg. And that can't be a copyright violation. Now, the only distinction the government has offered for why CableVision decision in the Second Circuit, and this goes to your question, Justice Kennedy, somehow should be different here, is in the supposed lawfulness of the first instance in which that content is received. That distinction can't work and would imperil the cloud. Here is why. When a person is accessing local over­the­air broadcast television, it is doing so because that is free public spectrum. And Sony says we have a fair use right in order to make a copy of that free use. The government in the Fortnightly case argued that there is an implied­in­law license when a person accesses local over­the­air telecasts in that way. So it can't be the distinction between our situation and CableVision that there is somehow some difference. Because if I'm watching local over­the­air broadcast TV in my home, I don't have to pay a royalty for it. And that's exactly the analogy that would be appropriate there. Now, how would that affect the cloud? Well, if you turn every type of performance that an individual makes from some content that gets downloaded or transferred from the cloud, the cloud provider can't tell what is legal or what is not legal. Some stuff could be up there pirated. Some stuff could be up there perfectly licensed. And what the position of the other side in this case is, those people are liable for direct infringement of the public performance right. And that's why the cloud industry is very concerned that if you have too expansive an interpretation of what is the public performance right, you are consigning them to potentially ruinous liability.",
  "Well, Justice Kagan, I note that my friend did not reference the words of the Transmit Clause at all when he offered that distinction. And that's actually quite important, because in order to get there, you have to make up words to put them in the Transmit Clause. But even if you were to think that that was good for a policy reason, you would still have to explain why the hundreds of thousands of people that are subscribers to Aereo's service don't have exactly the same fair use right to get over­the­air broadcast content that all of those people who are not Aereo subscribers but they happen to have a home antenna and a DVR. Those people have every bit as right to get that access. And the fact that they are doing it doesn't make their antenna or their antenna provider a content provider. As I said ­­",
  "Because if you don't have to buy a TV, a DVR and an antenna and a sling box, which might cost you thousands of dollars, you might pay $100 to rent it, or if you want to just look at programming selectively, you pay $8 a month, it's a rental service, Justice Ginsburg. That can't change the copyright analysis. And just because you rent equipment does not transform the person that is providing that equipment into a public performer, particularly when you are the one who initiates every set of signals that activates the programming and the content. If there are no further questions, we'll submit.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me start with your question, Justice Kennedy, because there absolutely will be remand proceedings on the presumption that you affirm the judgment of the Eighth Circuit so that the money can be allocated, and we know the names of every single person who would be entitled to an award based on a very long spreadsheet that Dr. Fox compiled in conjunction with Dr. Mericle's analysis. And so you're right, Justice Kagan, that there is a pot of money based on the jury verdict that will be allocated, assuming that the Court affirms the class certification judgment.",
  "Well, there are two ways, and I would submit that they ­­ neither is slap­dash. Ordinarily, we would defer to jury verdicts, and we would say that if the jury evaluated the evidence within the realm of what was presented at trial, that is going to get special deference in our legal system. So when those monies get allocated, ordinarily a district judge is going to do so on a basis either of pro rata for all of those ­­ all of those plaintiffs who were found to be injured, and the 212 who were identified by name, by Dr. Fox, Tyson knew about them before trial, did not move for summary judgment as to those 212, could have easily severed them right out before this case went to the jury. The second way is that Dr. Fox did an analysis using Mericle's averages and then added them to the number of minutes worked by the particular employee, and so based on that, a vast number got above the 40­hour threshold. Now, the evidence at trial that it came in by Tyson's own witnesses was that the average worker worked 48 hours per week before you even got to any of the counting of the donning and doffing, and that the plant ran on Saturdays 60 percent of the time, which would be a 6­day work week. And so the evidence as the jury was considering it found the vast majority of the class members were already going to be in overtime status, and that's why the fulcrum of the case came down to whether putting on this gear, which was standard sanitary gear for every single worker in the class, was compensable or not. We're ­­",
  "Well, and Tyson had an opportunity to ask for more specific instructions. In fact, their instructions were the ones that ended up governing the trial. So to the extent that they had a complaint ­­",
  "Well, I don't ­­",
  "Yeah. Well, on the substantive part, Mr. Chief Justice, let me say this. That in all these instances where there is a challenge between an aggregation or something where you could ask the jury for a more particularized decision, there's always a tactical and a strategic decision that the counsel on both sides are making and the parties on both sides.",
  "No, but ­­ but ­­",
  "Substantively, the way this is handled typically is that you would do a pro rata distribution of the jury proceeds to the members who are found to have been injured. That's the substantive answer. We have it the way ­­",
  "Well, let me ­­ let me address that question in this way because I do want to ­­",
  "I ­­ I think it is not.",
  "Because we ­­",
  "Because we had additional information testimony. And Mr. Chief Justice, on the variations, I think it's important to take into account what actually is going on with these Dr. Mericle observations about the 30 seconds versus the 10 minutes. What Dr. Mericle observed using the videotape in the men's locker room was that some of the men put their gear on in the locker room, and then they went down to the line. That might take them 10 minutes to do. Some of the men put on part of the equipment, and then they carried the rest. And they put it on while they were walking to the production line or while they were on the production line itself. And they were not counted.",
  "And that's what the district court rejected. The district court said there was not evidence to support that, that the ­­",
  "It was minimal. What the district court and what the court of appeals found was that the differences in equipment were ­­ were minimal, and that they would not drive the difference. And what Dr. Mericle testified ­­ and this is at 340­ ­­ 346 to 350 of the Joint Appendix ­­ he explained that the donning and doffing was occurring in different places and that what they argued about this 30­second­to­10­minute difference was, in fact, not an accurate depiction of the actual time that it took. Because the time clustered around the average; that was his testimony. And that if you took into account the fact that they might be doing it in different places, you then see why averaging works. And the reason averaging works is because the workers were rotating among different assignments. Some of them might start the day in a non­knife capacity, and so putting on all the protective gear before they started their shift didn't make sense. They would carry it to the production line. They would be pulled off the production line, told you're going to be in a knife capacity, get your gear on. They would put their gear on at that time. So when Dr. Mericle is observing in the locker room how long it takes for people to put their gear on and take it off, he's not counting, he's not ­­ he's not counting ­­ he's not taking into account the variations in the work style mandated by the company.",
  "Well, they were walking to a different part, and they were divided into ­­ they did have additional equipment in that one. But we divided them by departments, and we can identify the employees in the two different departments.",
  "There was rotation among ­­ and their own witness testified to that effect. That's at JA 236. He said they rotated quite frequently. And what he was explaining was that you might start on a particular assignment ­­ and ­­ and Dr. Mericle is taking a two­day snapshot, right? He's looking at video. And the ­­ the workers themselves were testifying that the actual donning and doffing basically clustered around the average. That's what Dr. Mericle observed.",
  "That's what the ­­ both courts below found. And ­­ and so when you are based with a factual record here that comes up here with both courts below, the ordinary presumption, particularly in a jury context, is you're going to interpret the facts in the light most supportive ­­",
  "Well, had this ­­ had the employer kept records, this would be a completely easy case for class certification purposes because every single issue would be done by common proof.",
  "It's actually simpler than that, Justice Kennedy. It's where you place the time clock. Had they put the punch clock right outside the locker room so that the workers, as soon as they went in the locker room, punched in, this problem would have been eliminated. Because at that point, when they were putting on the protective gear, the sanitary gear, and then they are walking ­­ and the walking is uniform for all class members. The sanitary gear is all uniform for all class workers. So when they're putting on their equipment in the locker room, if they punched in, the company has satisfied the FLSA and this problem goes away. And then the question is, is the walking and donning and doffing work? And that's what the trial was all about.",
  "Right. But if you take the sanitary ­­ I'm just saying, if you ­­ for the question of commonality and predominance, which I'm trying to address the first question ­­ the sanitary gear is all the same for everybody. The walking is all the same for everybody. And then the question is, can you use averaging because of the peculiarities of the fact that the doffing of this ­­ basically, the same gear was occurring in three different places: in the locker room, walking down to the production line, and on the production line itself.",
  "Well, I wouldn't expect that.",
  "But the ­­ what the district court found, and they didn't show ­­ look, we're talking about a difference between a Kevlar belly guard and a Plexiglas belly guard or a mesh, metal mesh belly guard. We're talking about the same basic kinds of gear. We're talking about different kinds of gloves. But those variations were presented to the jury, found to be minor. And the district court concluded that they were minor differences.",
  "Well, the question is ­­",
  "That's ­­ that's ­­",
  "That's correct. And the knife issue was solved ­­",
  "Thank you, Justice Ginsburg.",
  "Hard hats, ear plugs, hair nets, beard nets, and basic smocks.",
  "And boots. Sorry. I forgot boots.",
  "Right. But the point was, Mr. Chief Justice, that if you were on knife duty at a particular point in time, you were going to rotate frequently during the course of a day or from one day to the next, and so you were charged always to have your gear ready to be put on if you were put in a knife­wielding capacity.",
  "We certainly ­­",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, I think Mt. Clemens answers the question in this case. I think that, given the way the evidence came in, the averages here are reasonable ones. So even if there was not a special Mt. Clemens rule where there's a burden­shifting framework, the answer should be the same.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, we do agree with that position, but we also agree with Justice Kennedy that, because of the Mt. Clemens framework overlay for Fair Labor Standards Act, this is an easier case than a case in which there was not that substantive law difference. Because if you were to take one individual and you were to use the same evidence, it would be representative proof; you'd have the same burden­shifting framework. That's why all these arguments about Dr. Mericle really are merits questions, they're not class­certifying questions.",
  "Well, actually, Justice Sotomayor, that's where I would disagree with you, because ­­",
  "­­ if ­­ if the worker, through habit, convenience, is doffing while walking, our study didn't double count. Our study only took into account the walking time. So he's not going to get credit for the fact that he's doing work by putting on the gear while he happens to be walking. If he is pulled off the line during gang­time while the hogs are going along, he does not get extra minutes because his supervisor says, we need you with knife so go put your gear on. He's counted as part of gang­time at that point. And so ­­",
  "I didn't say that, and if I did, I was ­­ I misspoke.",
  "Within the department, they would perform different tasks, some of which would require knife and some which didn't. And it was within the department that the averages that were being observed we believe are fair averages, in light of the fact that we're looking back in time, and we're trying to recreate what happened in a ­­ in a three­year period that, you know, was ­­ where there are no records. And so within the department, what the Court found was that there was consistency, and that the differences were minimal. The reason why there's a three­minute difference is because one is longer. It's a longer distance for walking to get to it, and there is, you know, more to be done. But I want to make clear that we ­­ we broke this down into the two different departments because we could discern those. But I would submit that the ­­",
  "I think what you write, Justice Kennedy, is that in this context, where there was an expert who said that the averages ­­ they clustered around the averages, and that based on observations where the work activity, the donning and doffing that is contested here is occurring in three different places, it's fair to treat the employees because the FLSA is a remedial statute that is designed to protect workers who can't keep these kinds of records. That's why ­­",
  "Well, I think every case is going to be different, as we would all candidly recognize, and an antitrust case is going to be different from a labor case. And that will be different from ­­ I think you do have to look at the substantive context in which the averaging is going to occur so that any deviations at least are explicable. Here ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "The averaging, I think you should infer from the jury's award of damages to the injured ­­ and it was instructed not to give damages to the uninjured workers, and was faithfully charged with that. The fact that it awards a lesser amount may be based on its own doubts about the number of minutes or the quantity. But those kinds of calculations, I submit, Justice Scalia, we have always deferred to juries in the way these kinds of damages are calculated.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Abood correctly held that States may reasonably insist that nonmembers pay their share of costs for the services provided by a union to the government and to all employees as their exclusive representative. Overruling Abood now would substantially disrupt established First Amendment doctrine and labor management systems in nearly half the country. Let me talk about what a collective bargaining is, and how the agreement is struck, and how it evolves over time. Because it's not simply one contract where there might be a severability provision, but it is really system of agreements that are established over time, and a body of relationships that build up. And if you look at the Joint Appendix, there are several examples of collective bargaining agreements. They are very long, detailed agreements that include a wide range of services that are negotiated between the union and the government. And some of these are monetary. Many of these are hot­button issues, to be sure, Justice Kennedy, but many of them are also mundane issues about health and welfare benefits, what times teachers need to show up, how long their lunch break can be without having to perform a duty, what the policies are for transferring teachers between and among school districts, and these are all basic services that require research, legal representation, conferring and consulting, communicating with members, trying to ascertain what the positions of all members of the workforce are before the union presents a ­­ a policy ­­",
  "Well ­­ and, in fact, in California, the overwhelming majority of the teachers are in the union, and it's only a small percentage that have opted not to. But I would go further, Justice Kennedy, in saying that what we are talking about here are a range of services that they're providing. We're talking about a service fee for the State law that provides for the exclusive representative to be the union when that is voted for by a majority of the workers. And here, this Court's cases have distinguished between citizens' speech, where the very teacher who might disagree with the union's position is free to go and speak publicly about that position, and employment speech, where this Court's cases have been extraordinarily deferential to the government in upholding restrictions on what speech employees may make.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, I think that it is fair to suppose that the government, in deciding whether it's going to establish a relationship with its workers and were to get input, is necessarily going to be dealt with a cacophony of views unless it comes up with a reasonable system of management to get those views collected and have them represented by an exclusive representative. And that is the basic trade­off that Abood recognized. And I would note that because different States have chosen, based on their history, their culture, their experiences with the labor management system in the private sector, to come up with different results. And here, I would say that Wisconsin and Michigan, which recently adopted alterations to their public management sector, established this point. Because on the one hand, the legislature in Wisconsin decided we're going to do away with public sector agency fees for school teachers and for government workers, but we're going to keep it for public safety officers, police officers, firefighters, because we determined there is a legislative interest in having agency fees. Why? The firefighters brief in this case explains that many States don't have safety regulations for firefighters. And so a lot of these regulations end up coming through the collective bargaining process, where firefighters work out negotiated rules to establish what is a safe way to fight a fire.",
  "Chief Justice, the necessity standard has never been the standard when the government is operating as employer or proprietor. It has always been a case that you would judge the agency ­­ the government's decision on the basis of what is appropriate or reasonable. And if you look at it from that standard, what the firefighters are saying here is that it's actually essential to have agency fees, because they are using those fees to benefit all of the workers in the ­­ in the unit through getting additional equipment that the county may not be able to afford, additional training so what when they're called upon to fight a fire ­­",
  "That's right. The union members and the nonmembers of the union in the ­­ in the unit are putting their money together through the agency fee process so that the union is supplying ­­",
  "Sure.",
  "Yes. The flip side is that the State briefs and the City briefs that have been submitted in this Court note what happened when the agency fee process didn't occur. In New York City, for example, there were strikes that were occurring all of the time until an agency fee ­­ fee system was put into place, and that enabled the City to better deliver transit services, school services, and the like. So you have both the positive story by ­­",
  "Because it enables all of the workers to know they are making a shared sacrifice for the purpose of working together to establish a coherent position with their employer. That's ­­",
  "I understand ­­",
  "No. What I'm ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "Justice Scalia, all I can report on in the absence of a factual record ­­ because this was basically brought as a facial challenge ­­ is what is in the amicus briefs. In cities, States, school districts, hospitals that are management­side have supported agency fees because they find it to be a more workable system by having ­­",
  "­­ employees buy into the policies that are being established ­­",
  "­­ through the collective bargaining process.",
  "No. What I'm saying, Mr. Chief Justice, is the States can make rational and reasonable judgments that for their workability of a system, they can have an agency­fee process. Abood recognized the very Federalism interests that are at stake here, where different States have different experiences, and this is an opportunity for the States to draw upon those distinctive experiences in coming up with a system that's fair for everyone.",
  "Well, the first thing I would have put in, it would have been a response to Justice Kennedy's question, which is that Ms. Friedrichs has said publicly she's happy with the positions the union is taking on pay. It would be anomalous to suppose that we're going to decide a case of this kind of constitutional import with a lead plaintiff who has said publicly she agrees with the union's positions on pay.",
  "No. I think that that's the point, Mr. ­­",
  "No. I think that there are undoubtedly ­­ there are undoubtedly issues in a hundred­page collective bargaining agreement in which reasonable people can say, we don't like where the bargain got struck. But the point here is government workability and assessing the reasonableness of the government's position.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, I guess the question is, are you going to decide a case of this constitutional significance on the basis of a hypothesis based on ­­",
  "I think that is a one of many points that a record would be helpful, but let me just say that we're talking here ­­",
  "And your decision in Garcetti, Justice Kennedy, allowed for the suppression of the speech by the prosecutor who objected ­­",
  "Those are all classic workplace situations.",
  "You are talking about workplace ­­",
  "­­ speech ­­",
  "That's correct. And the point ­­",
  "We submit that, given the four­decade history, they have the burden to demonstrate that the way the system has worked would be unworkable if it were to be ­­ if it were to be sustained. And ­­ and Justice Kennedy, back to your point. I appreciate that a prosecutor's memo might be viewed in your eyes as workplace speech whereas the teachers' position about what size the classroom might be may not seem the same way as workplace speech. But from of government's perspective, I think you have to assess that on the basis of the reasonableness of the system that the government ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "­­ their speech isn't silenced. They are paying a service fee so that a ­­ the exclusive representative can negotiate their health and welfare benefits, their mileage reimbursement, a whole set of things that ­­ voluntary teacher transfer policy, the questions about when teachers have to show up, how long their duty breaks ­­ duty­free breaks are during the course of the day. These are all relatively mundane points. I ­­ I think you would agree with me. And there's nothing in the agency fee process that suppresses the ability of teachers to speak out publicly, and even within the process because the law itself allows for merit pay to be a subject of bargaining if a minority of the teachers can convince the majority that this is a position that the teachers ought to take.",
  "On the second question presented, we think that the decision ought to be affirmed because Abood correctly recognized that here, where there was basically no burden on the person who wanted to opt out, that that was in itself a core question.",
  "It's administratively ­­ actually, in a system where the overwhelming majority ­­ and we're talking about more than 90 percent of the people are paying the fees, even those that are nonchargeable fees under the Lehnert line to support political activities, it's administratively much easier to count a smaller number. And the question is whether the suppression of their constitutional rights is such as to rise to the level of compulsion. Here we would submit that where there's a one­page checkbox, they can send it in, they are able ­­ and every Petitioner on the other side has successfully opted out of paying those ­­ that the burden is on them to show that the government has made an unreasonable choice as to the kind of administrative scheme that's been established.",
  "Well, let me just say that the perpetual opt out is not an issue in this case. And it ­­ had it been raised, it very well might be an acceptable way to do, to say I want to opt out until further notice. That's not been presented or argued here. If it were to be argued, there are reasons why that might be appropriate. But here, having an annual process follows this Court's Hudson decision where the union is required on an annual basis to provide notice of the activities that are chargeable and not chargeable. So from the perspective of getting notice to the potential objecting member, it allows more flexibility.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The European Union and 26 of its Member States brought this case in the United States against a United States corporation for the actions it committed in the United States and from the United States, that had effects in Europe. This was a completely logical and natural place for this case to be brought ­­",
  "Well, first, the fact that RJR has no subsidiary in Europe raised a question of personal jurisdiction that would have affected the enforceability of judgments. And you had an issue where you had 26 Member States that were being affected, and the logical place for them in working together would be in the United States court. For precisely the reason that when the legal advisor in 1982 testified after this Court's Pfizer decision about the applicability and reciprocity of having foreign countries come to United States courts, the legal advisor testified that the United States had brought cases in over 50 jurisdictions around the world.",
  "Justice Alito, what I'm saying is that it varies among the Member States. But what we do know is the defendant, the evidence, the witnesses are here in the United States, and the allegation is that they violated U.S. law. And it is the same kind of action that the United States has brought in European Member States for many, many years ­­",
  "We did ­­ we ­­",
  "Justice Breyer ­­",
  "Thank you for asking me this question. We presented information to the U.S. officials before the suit was filed, and were told that the U.S. would be neutral as to it. Furthermore, I can tell you that in 20 years of practicing before this Court, this is the single most comprehensively vetted exercise on my brief that I have ever had. EU officials have gone over every single line and compared with the positions taken by Member States in other cases. And the reason why this isn't important to the EU, and the consistency with which those positions is made, rests on four very important principles. When Congress extended RICO extraterritorially, there are one of four components that is present in every single one of the 40­some statutes that the Solicitor General puts in Appendix B: The victim is an American; the defendant is an American, the perpetrator; there is effect on U.S. interests; or there is conduct that occurs in the United States. Every one of those four components tracks with an important principle of international law. The extraterritoriality principle, the nationality principle, the passive protective personality principle, and the protective personality. So these issues are things that Congress was considering and was aware of when it made the decision to extend these crimes extraterritorially ­­",
  "­­ it posed a domestic requirement. Sorry.",
  "Sorry. In foreign courts, or in the United States?",
  "Well, not under RICO. I don't think that a foreign government or foreign country would be using the law ­­",
  "Not that I'm aware of.",
  "Because I'm not aware that ­­ that the English courts would apply RICO in this case. I have no brief to defend, Justice Kennedy, in this respect.",
  "No, what ­­ what it does, Justice Kennedy, and this is why it's actually important to go through statute by statute all of the provisions in the Solicitor General's appendix, and we've got a binder that's got every single one of them, and you can ask me about every one. Congress imposed a domestic proof requirement as to every extension of extraterritoriality for those crimes. The victim had to be an American. The defendant had to be an American. Conduct had to occur in the United States or there had to be some important interest of the United States that was at stake. If those four elements were not required or not part of the statute, then it would not track with the normal international law principles by which nations respect through comity the regulations of conduct emanating from the shores of that country.",
  "It is, but the Defendant is an American and conduct was occurring here in the United States. And if you look at the money laundering statute, Mr. Chief Justice ­­",
  "One of those four ­­",
  "All I'm saying is one of the four. Here we have two of them. If you look at the money laundering statute, conduct occurred in the United States and the defendant was in the United States national. And so international law is satisfied. Comity principles are satisfied. In those cases, like the Alien Tort Statute where you did not have a cause of action that had been drafted by Congress and so, therefore, you did not have a legislative determination of the effect on comity interests internationally, you're left with a situation where you had judge­made law, and this Court, I think appropriately, followed the guidance and advice of foreign nations which said, be careful how far you extend judge­made law. There is a different principle at stake when there is a considered legislative judgment and the limitation on that extraterritorial impact is one that has a very clear tie to the United States.",
  "So it's hard for me to see, based on your hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, which of the predicate crimes would be asserted as the underlying pattern of ­­ of racketeering. I've actually thought of a lot of them.",
  "I haven't found one.",
  "I haven't found one.",
  "Yes.",
  "But, Mr. Chief Justice, my point is that if you look at each one of the acts that is incorporated and has an extraterritorial component, there is a direct tie to the United States, and the crimes have to be unindictable under Federal or State law. So with respect, I think what you're hypothesizing is a situation that would be a null set, and that's where these crimes are occurring in Europe under European member State laws, and somehow there is going to be a tie in to RICO, that wouldn't be possible under a plain reading of the RICO statute.",
  "That's correct.",
  "That's correct. There are roughly three­quarters of the statutes that are incorporated into RICO that do not have an extraterritorial effect, and those would not be subject to a RICO case that would have extraterritorial consequences.",
  "Actually, treble damages are not at all the reason why this case was brought in the United States. And, in fact, if you want me to stipulate that we will not accept treble damages, I've been authorized by my clients to say that that is not what we are seeking here. What we are seeking here is a situation where an American company is operating through largely illegal cutouts and middlemen and organized criminal operators in Europe and in the Mediterranean and violating and affecting European enterprises. The complaint in this case, which is very detailed with respect to the introduction of cigarettes made and marketed in the United States are targeted to foreign country audiences, but they are being sold through illegal channels through Panama, through other countries and into Europe through organized crime and drug cartel operators. I have seen the evidence for this. I have looked at the documents from RJR. I can tell you this is the most serious misconduct, and it involves very, very serious allegations that have been proved by the internal documents of the company itself.",
  "Well, in fact ­­",
  "Justice Alito, if ­­ if the European nations know that they are eventually going to have to come to the United States to enforce the judgment and there is no ­­ there are no assets to attach in Europe by RJR, because it doesn't have subsidiaries there, the simplest thing to do would be a one­step process. This suit was filed almost 16 years ago, 15, 16 years ago and we are still at the motion to dismiss stage. You can imagine that from the perspective of litigation efficiency coming into the home forum of the defendant and saying, we believe you are violating U.S. law and we seek redress for that, that is perfectly appropriate. If I could turn to the injury question, the RICO statute incorporated language of the Clayton Act which, before 1970, had been construed to permit foreign plaintiffs to come into the United States and obtain foreign damages as a result of U.S. violations by the company in the United States. The Continental Ore case, which was decided by this Court in 1962, is directly on point. That case holds that injury suffered by Canadian entities could come in and come into the United States and get damages as a result of the violation of the Clayton Act. In Pfizer, the government of India, coupled with governments in Iran and the Philippines, came to the United States and alleged that Pfizer owned ­­",
  "I ­­ I would assume that the Belgium courts ­­ and I'm not going to profess to be an expert on the enforceability of judgments in Belgium, Justice Breyer, and so I give you that answer.",
  "To get a ­­ well, presuming that there was personal jurisdiction in the United States, assume ­­",
  "I ­­ I don't know the answer to your question.",
  "Here is the answer, though. The answer is that if those Belgium banks are in a conspiracy with RJR, it surely cannot be the case that U.S. law does not cover RJR. If there is a question about the enforceability of a judgment against the Belgium banks, presumably the Belgium banks will make that argument, and they will claim in Belgium that ­­ that somehow a suit prosecuted in the United States in which they were co­conspirators is somehow not going to cover their activity. Our point is that it can't be the case where, for centuries, the United States courts have been open to allow foreign plaintiffs to come in alleging injury caused by U.S. actors under U.S. law, that somehow we're going to read the Morrison principle as a way of constricting the available remedies. Nothing in Morrison suggests that you would do that kind of extraterritorial slicing and dicing, where once you had concluded that the underlying action here was one that observed and respected international norms and went to extraterritorial lengths provided in this case, that there is a tie to the United States. And whatever remedies are available are available. And after Pfizer, a number of U.S. companies were concerned about it, and they went to Congress and they asked Congress to restrict it. And the hearings that we have laid out in our brief ­­ and this is page 45, note 11 ­­ goes into the legislative history of this. And the State Department, Justice Breyer, took exactly the opposite position, because the State Department said, reciprocity demands that we be allowed to go into other nations' courts and the availability of our courts for foreign nations to come in for violations of the U.S. And if you look at footnote 13, which is on page 55, the State Department testified to Congress that the United States had brought more than 50 actions in nations around the world. So the idea about comity is one that, respectfully, is a decision that is made by Congress, and it is not for the executive branch to change its position for the purpose of trying to snuff out a remedy that otherwise would be available to a foreign plaintiff.",
  "That's true.",
  "It could. And, Justice Kagan, if you were to decide that the three verbs that are in 1962(a), (b) and (c), which are influencing, buying, or investing in, had to have a domestic component, we still would satisfy that, because our allegations in the complaint are that RJR from its corporate headquarters in New York and Winston­Salem was engaging in those conducts to effect and corrupt the foreign enterprise, or the domestic enterprise, as was the case with Brown & Williamson.",
  "So, Justice Alito, I would have two responses. '64, 1964, incorporates directly 1962. So there is a direct reference to the definition of \"racketeering\" that has the some 46 predicate acts that have a clearly textual extraterritorial effect. So I think that by incorporation, you would interpret it that way. And the second thing is that when Congress used that language in 1964, it was tracking the Clayton Act. And the Clayton Act had a ­­ a predetermined and pre­understood meaning as to what those words meant.",
  "No. My position is that the ­­ the extraterritorial application has gotten stronger over time, but if you were to adopt the normal canon of construction, which is that when Congress adopts words in a statute, they carry with it the meaning that this Court has given those words. The same words are in the Clayton Act as they were adopted in 1970, and as Justice Kagan pointed out, the case has only become stronger with the Money Laundering and post­PATRIOT Act additions of those predicate acts. But the third answer I would give you, Justice Alito, is that even in Morrison itself, the Court's opinion says once we have found there to be extraterritorial application, it's not for us to be deciding that there are different provisions that shouldn't have that. And that's essentially the argument that is being made as to take an extension of Morrison beyond where the Court was ­­",
  "And my answer is, Congress has addressed some of those concerns in the antitrust area with various amendments that affect ­­ that ­­ that only go to conduct. And classically, what Congress is getting at is conduct, not remedy. But in the conduct area, what Congress has done in one of the antitrust amendments for the Sherman Act was to say, we are only going to affect foreign conduct if it has a domestic effect, but it is still a focus on conduct and not on remedy. Congress is very well­equipped to deal with this issue should it proceed that ­­ there to be a concern, but Justice Breyer, I would point out that it would be odd to suppose that Congress is intending to turn the United States into a place where criminal activities could occur from the United States that was affecting our closest allies and there was nothing those allies could do about it by going into the United States and trying to vindicate and ­­ and seek redress for those harms. That would be a very, very stark departure from this country's long history of having respect and ­­ and provide a remedy for foreigners who are harmed by actions of the United States and its citizens. If I could just address the ­­ I think I've addressed the Empagran question, because that's the statute that was affected. And if I could just note that the PATRIOT Act ­­ footnote 10 of our brief points out that then­Senator John Kerry, now Secretary of State, was very conscious of the effect that this would have on foreign nations and foreign litigants. And when the PATRIOT Act extended certain of these predicate acts into RICO, he stated on the floor ­­ we cited the provision in our brief ­­ the reason for doing that was to give foreign nations that had been affected and who were treaty allies an opportunity to come and seek redress in our courts. The last point is that Mr. Katsas noted the choice­of­law principle, where there is a foreign injury and there is a decision to apply foreign law, and he says, why shouldn't that apply here? That only applies where there is a conflict between the laws that would apply here ­­ we are asserting that there is a U.S. statutory violation by a U.S. company for actions that it committed in part in the United States. There's no reason to apply a choice of law, because you have a foreign company that is ­­ or foreign interests that are asserting a violation of U.S. domestic law. In every instance where Congress made the decision to apply RICO extraterritorially, it imposed important domestic proof requirements. That is the limiting principle on which the Court ought to decide this case. Thank you."
