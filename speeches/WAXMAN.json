[
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question was -- reference was made to the caption in the Senate report, and it also appears in the House report, of Congress' conclusion that the State remedies were inadequate, a conclusion that was also supported by the 50 State Governors' committees that examined this issue, and the question I think that Justice Scalia asked was, inadequate to do what, because that, after all, is the issue. Now, this is a case where a statute was enacted before Seminole Tribe and before Boerne, and therefore the paradigm that this Court has created for the words, the precise magic words that we would now expect Congress to use didn't -- can't, I think, fairly be imposed on a coordinate branch of Government. But the answer, Justice Scalia, to the question, I think, is determined by reference to what the legislative record before Congress, not only when it conducted its eighteen hearings and amassed seven separate complete reports in enacting the ADA, but also when it investigated the problems that led it to create the CRIPA statute, the Constitutional Rights of Institutionalized Persons, and IDEA, and others, but looking just -- looking --",
  "I absolutely --",
  "Justice Kennedy, I agree, and I would say therefore that the question fairly put is whether the Disabilities Act sweeps more broadly than Congress could reasonably have deemed necessary to remedy and prevent the constitutional problem it found applying this Court's definition of the standard, and what it found were four things. It found, first, that there is pervasive and widespread discrimination against the disabled, which is often the product of hostility, overbroad and irrational stereotypes, and deliberate selective indifference, the hallmarks of unconstitutional intent.",
  "No, I -- well, I don't think a court would -- a court would not find that invalid, applying a rational basis standard, because this Court has had -- has held that under rational basis review of legislation one looks at whether there is a conceivable rational basis that would support a distinction, and that, in fact --",
  "Well, Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, this Court has made clear that as a paradigm of --",
  "Was -- if your question was whether I also understood Mr. Gottesman to say that, I --",
  "I do not agree that a legislature that could have had a -- a legislature that could have had a rational reason for doing something which, in fact, was motivated by invidious discrimination would be struck down if this Court applied rational basis review, but Cleburne, it seems to me, and the other cases in which this Court has dealt with and remarked on discrimination against the disabled points the way to the correct resolution of this case, and before I -- I do want to address that, but first I'll finish --",
  "In Cleburne --",
  "Well, there is a great debate about the answer to that question, but I will answer the question on the assumption that the Court in fact applied rational basis review, but what the Court explained was that rational basis review is contextual, and context, just like applying the proportionate and congruence test, is contextual, and it requires a reference to the historical context in which it arises. And what this Court said in Cleburne is, we are not going to look first at the facial constitutionality or unconstitutionality of this statute. We're going to require, in the unique context of a history of pervasive invidious discrimination against the disabled, what this municipality's reasons were. And having looked at that, it concluded that the -- that it must have been motivated by an invidious intent, because the proferred reasons were not, in fact, rational. Now, Cleburne, in the context of many other cases in which this Court and Justices of this Court have remarked on the history of pervasive invidious discrimination against the disabled, provided -- essentially gave Congress the blueprint in which it acted in this case, and here's why.",
  "Our argument doesn't depend on it, but I think the answer from Cleburne is yes, because in Cleburne what this Court said -- and I don't have the exact words in front of me -- was that because discrimination against the disabled is such a complicated issue, that is, because there are reasons why differential treatment is sometimes permitted and, indeed, perhaps the Constitution sometimes requires it, that we have to give broad deference to the legislatures, and we have to let legislatures deal, as they more competently can, with this difficult problem, unless --",
  "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but what this Court said in Cleburne is, because of that unique history, absent congressional direction, we will apply, as a paradigm of judicial restraint, rational basis review.",
  "That --",
  "And I'm not suggesting to the contrary, Justice Kennedy. I was responding to Justice O'Connor's question about whether a legislature could instruct a court to apply a different level of scrutiny, and the language in Cleburne that says access --",
  "We -- I believe, as Cleburne says, absent congressional direction we apply rational basis for review.",
  "I agree that that's not necessarily the case, but if I can simply point out, Justice Kennedy -- this actually does go back to Justice Scalia's original question -- that not only was -- I mean, it is important, it is critical here to understand that not only does the Congress find a massive record of discrimination based on states of mind that are the hallmarks of constitutional intent, but also that this discrimination is the legacy of a not-too-distant past in which Government practices deliberately isolated, segregated, and withheld from the disabled fundamental rights and the chance to participate in mainstream life. When Justice Marshall wrote, in his separate opinion in Cleburne, a statement that no Justice contradicted, that a regime of State-mandated segregation and degradation that in its virulence and bigotry rivaled and, indeed, paralleled the worst excesses of Jim Crow --",
  "Not at all, Justice --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, the point I'm making is more broadly that Congress itself had before it a record not only of what was going on currently, but what had produced it. The Civil Rights Commission prepared a report --",
  "I'm -- as an observation of historical fact, Congress could certainly rely on it, and he was not the only one in Cleburne to make that observation. Justice Stevens, writing for himself and the Chief Justice, said that through ignorance and prejudice the mentally retarded have been subjected to a history of unfair and often grotesque mistreatment.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, so that I am not -- I don't want to be misunderstood. This is not an -- I'm using the -- Justice Marshall's categorization because I think it well-reflects the evidence that Congress itself heard. The Civil Rights Commission report accommodating the spectrum which was submitted to Congress at its request details at great length, and was decided -- and was issued before Cleburne, the history of State- sponsored intentional, pervasive isolation and segregation and --",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. Forced -- yes, it does. Forced sterilization, refusal to allow --",
  "The --",
  "The Civil Rights Commission report uses the word, unconstitutional, but whether it does or not, the practices -- I don't think anybody -- I don't think that Mr. Sutton would conclude that the historical practices -- and I'm not suggesting they persist, but we're talking here about a section 5 authority not only to deal with a pervasive current problem, but to remedy the effects of past intentional unconstitutional discrimination. The remedy for past segregation and isolation is integration, and that explains in part why the Disabilities Act admittedly reaches some conduct that a court applying rational basis review would not deem unconstitutional. It's both. It's that --",
  "The one thing one can certainly say, whatever words one uses, and Justice Stevens in his concurrence in Cleburne, as I recall it, basically says, I don't really know whether we have three distinct typologies. I consider all of this rational basis review. It just depends on how high the justification is and how great the reason there is to suspect that something unconstitutional may be going on. But it is clear that what Cleburne did was, in looking at the actual administrative bureaucratic decision, as opposed to the legislative choice, require an articulation of the actual reasons in the context of alleged discrimination in this unique historical area. And what Congress did essentially was to generalize what this Court did in Cleburne. It took this Court's specific inquiry in Cleburne in the light of the Court, many instances in which the majority of this Court has remarked about the history of discrimination in Choate, Alexander v. Choate and other cases, and it applied it to what Congress had in front of it, which was on the one hand a body of half-a-dozen or a dozen comprehensive studies detailing a widespread problem and historic unconstitutional practices, and over 5,000 narrative accounts that the congressional task force accumulated of individual instances of discrimination against the handicapped, 600 of which addressed State or local governments which for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment and State action have to be considered as one.",
  "May I --",
  "May I answer?",
  "At footnote 11 in our brief we cite some of those decisions but, as this Court recognized in Watson v. Forth Worth Bank & Trust there are many, many instances in which subconscious attitudes and prejudices cannot be proved to a judicial exactitude. Thank you very much.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are two principal issues in this first case and, with the Court's leave, I'll address each in turn. First, the Clean Air Act does not violate the nondelegation doctrine. The Act prescribes the following: EPA must set national ambient air quality standards for a limited set of ubiquitous pollutants. The standards must be requisite to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety. They must be based on criteria that reflect the latest scientific knowledge about the identifiable effects of the pollutant in the ambient air, and the administrator must consult an independent body of scientific experts and explain any significant departure from its recommendations. For 30 years, successive administrators have applied the Act's terms consistently. Requisite means sufficient, but not more than necessary to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety. Public health addresses not all biological effects, and not even all medical effects, but only those adverse health effects that threaten populations. And identifiable effects means those that are shown to exist not hypothesized. The Court of Appeals --",
  "They do; that is, the legislative history -- says that they must be adverse, which the administrator and the Court of Appeals means medically significant. Now, they have to be also medically significant to a sufficient population to constitute a public health effect. The Court of Appeals held that the Constitution requires more, specifically the articulation of what it called a determinate criterion to govern the setting of the precise standard for each pollutant. That is contrary to this Court's precedents which require that the Court articulate only an intelligible principle or, as the Court has otherwise put it, that the Court delineate the general policy, the public agency that is to accomplish it, and the boundaries of the delegated authority.",
  "I believe I can say it in one sentence, Justice O'Connor.",
  "For a discrete set of pollutants and based on published air quality criteria that reflect the latest scientific knowledge, EPA must establish uniform national standards at a level that is requisite to protect public health from the adverse effects of the pollutant in the ambient air. Now that, in our view, means that Congress has made the fundamental policy choices, and it is also articulated both substantive and procedural constraints on EPA's application of the specified standard. The Constitution simply does not require more. There is a second issue in the case, if I can outline what our position is.",
  "No. Absolutely not. And let me answer your direct question first, and if I can and if it would be helpful to the Court, quickly outline the steps, the serial steps, that the Agency must go through every time the administrator has to modify it.",
  "The Agency looks first based on the criteria documents at the identifiable effects. Those are effects that science has identified will happen to people not hypothesized risks about what might happen. That's number one.",
  "Number two, it then looks at whether those demonstrated effects rise to the level of medical significance, not whether they are -- there is some effect on the biology of a cell, but whether it rises with respect to any person to the level at which a physician applying in this case the standards of the American Thoracic Society would determine that that person requires treatment, that that person, if you will, is ill or manifesting a significant medical symptom.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, requisite has been defined by the Agency, and it's supported both by the legislative history and the D.C. Circuit, to mean sufficient, but not more than necessary. That is, the Congress could not have been clearer that zero risk or background levels of a pollutant, that is levels that exist in the ambient air without man-made activity, is not what the administrator is aiming for or what the Act is designed to protect.",
  "Well, perhaps I -- if I may, perhaps I can, to answer your question by reference to either or both of the two pollutants that are at issue here. With respect to particulate matter, for example, there was a preexisting standard that was set in 1987. The Agency pursuant to the Act's requirements that the standards be reviewed every five years in light of the latest scientific knowledge went back and collected all of the medical and scientific study and prepared them in a criteria document, which is a multivolume set that is reviewed by CASAC, the independent advisory committee, which agreed that it was what it called the best ever compilation of the health effects of small particulate matter on public health. The EPA then created a -- what is called a staff paper. The staff paper distills the science and organizes the data in a series of recommendations. That, too, was reviewed by CASAC, which agreed that the ranges of concentrations -- and this I think is what you're getting to -- provided the appropriate parameters for the administrator's decision. Now, with respect to particulate matter, the staff recommended, and CASAC agreed, that it was important to separately measure particulate, fine particulate matter; that is, matter that is equal to or less than 25 micrograms per cubic meter. And if the staff with CASAC's approval set both the upper bound and the lower bound for the administrator's decision based on what the science revealed.",
  "Well, a couple of reasons, Justice O'Connor.",
  "First of all, as I think we'll probably address in some detail in the next hour, the EPA uses costs and feasibility standards in many, many of the things that it does, and it uses the information, this information that CASAC provides for that purpose. For example, in all -- the Act essentially creates a two-part process. The first part is the setting of these national standards that set a floor for ambient air across the whole country and do not apply of their own force to any source of polluting, whether it's me driving my car or the utility plant that generates my power. The second part of the Act is implementation; that is, how do you go about achieving these standards, and the states and EPA have vast authority and discretion to determine how that's done, and costs and other implementation factors, like technological constraints, are used at that point to determine what's reasonable. This Court in Union Electric in 1976 pointed out that costs and technological considerations are amply used in the implementation process, so long as they don't avoid it.",
  "Yes, since --",
  "The legislative history and the text of the '70 Act are absolutely clear, and the EPA and the D.C. Circuit have been unanimous for 30 years that in the first part of the Clean Air Act, that is in setting the standards, the EPA is to consider only what the criteria documents reveal as the effects on public health and welfare of the pollutant in the air, and that costs are determined at the implementation phase by the states, by EPA, and by Congress. Now, your point about CASAC, I think is very important to understand. The CASAC was created in the 1977 amendments, and it was directed to do two things, and it's reflected at pages 112-A and 113-A of the appendix to our petition. First, in 109(d)(2)(b) it is told to review both the criteria, which I was just discussing, and the national ambient air quality standard that EPA proposes in light of its scientific knowledge and what the criteria document reveals, and that is part of the NAAQS standard-setting process, and in this case the CASAC issued what they called closure letters, both with respect to the criteria documents on PM and ozone and with respect to the staff papers on particulate matter and ozone. You have directed my attention to a separate section of the statute which says that such committees shall also, and then it lists a series of things that it should do. That section, the section that relates to implementation technologies, et cetera relates to the implementation process of the standards. The EP -- for example, with respect to the PM and ozone standards, the CASAC has not yet issued any of that information because the Agency has not yet either begun to implement the eight-hour standard or the 2.5 standard, or indicated in notice and comment rulemaking how it will go about doing that. The provision that you have questioned, Justice O'Connor, ties in perfectly with the provision in -- also in Section 7409, I can't remember which subsection it is, which requires the EP -- or maybe it's Section 7408. In any event, I'll explain to you what I have in mind. The 1970 Act, which required EPA to set national standards for the first time under the 1967 Act, they were set by the states. In the 1967 Act, the states were told to set them by reference to two things that EPA's predecessor, HEW, would supply them. The first was the criteria document accumulating the science data on health effects, which is the same thing we have today. The second thing was a description of costs, pollution control technologies, feasibility, et cetera, and the '67 Act told the states that they were to conform their standards to both of those documents. Now in 1970, the Congress did two very significant things. First of all, it gave, it made the requirement to set standards mandatory and upon EPA, that is, on a national basis, so we would have a national floor. Then the second thing which is really significant to your question is that it separated out the two things that EPA was collecting and providing. And it provided that EPA was to still do the criteria documents, but that the NAAQS, the national standards, would be based on those criteria documents only, and the Act provides that at the time that the criteria documents are issued, EPA shall also provide to the states and to Congress information about costs, implementation, and available control technologies so that they can use that information in the standard-setting process that this Court reviewed in Union Electric.",
  "I can talk until interrupted, but I would prefer to answer questions, of course.",
  "I do believe it is their main point, and it is -- it fundamentally misconceives both what the Act requires and what every administrator since 1970 has done. As I was saying before, when the administrator gets the decision, it gets a staff report validated by CASAC that shows the upper bound and lower bound of where a standard should be set based on the application to the latest scientific knowledge of the standard requisite to protect public health, and in this case, you gave the ozone standard, the standard was at the upper level .09 parts per million over an eight-hour period and at the lower level, .07. Now, the question about why the administrator chose one number within that range is, of course, the question that the Court of Appeals under Section 307(b)(1) to which it will apply the arbitrary and capricious not in accordance with law standard that it has not yet done in this case, but I can articulate for you why both why no one thought the range should be below .07, that is regulating down to zero risk, and why the administrator chose .07 versus .08. I'll start with the second first to make sure that I get to the salient point. .07 was, and this is reflected in the Federal Register notice promulgating the rule at pages 38863 to 38868. .08 was chosen over .07 because one, there were no demonstrated adverse health effects below .08. Two, the average responses, even at .08 were typically small or mild. Three, the most certain effects at or below .08 were transient and reversible. Four, .07 is at or slightly above peak background levels in some locations. And five, not one single member of CASAC recommended .07 and in the legal challenges in the Court of Appeals to the standard, no party has challenged the administrator's decision not to go to .07. .07 was viewed by CASAC and the EPA staff as within the lower range because with respect to two of the six testable health effects or end points or lung function, that is, the ability to exhale, the volume you exhale in one second and symptoms, it was possible to extrapolate from studies done at and above .08 to levels all the way down to zero just by using an arithmetic extrapolation.",
  "There may be certain --",
  "Justice Scalia, there is no evidence in the record and no basis for an assertion that either CASAC or the EPA or the administrator have done what they have said the law does not permit them to do. That is, to take economic or cost effects into account.",
  "When there is an observed symptomatic -- as I said, there are six different health effects that are measured, and these are reflected in the staff papers. They range in level from very serious to potentially not serious at all. The first two are mortality and emergency room hospital admissions. The middle two are: is there inflammation in the lungs, and do the lungs manifest an unnatural responsiveness to pathogens or infection, and the two smaller ones which I addressed as to which there is data below .08 are, does it limit the amount of volume you can expel?",
  "There may be some transient effects. Inflammation in the lungs for -- a hospital admission may reflect a transient effect, but the administrator since 1970 has viewed that as by definition adverse.",
  "No, I may have misspoken. But there are -- if you are -- EPA concludes that if epidemiological studies show that you are required to go to the emergency room, they deem that to be an adverse health effect. That is, a medically significant health effect. What the administrator does when she gets the data within the range is to make a judgment. The statute requires her to make a judgment within that range by reference to three factors. She looks first, Justice Scalia, at the nature and severity of the health effects. A cough is not like a death, obviously. She looks at --",
  "Coughs may count.",
  "The criterion --",
  "The criterion -- nothing that -- anything that does not rise to the level of a medically significant health effect does not count.",
  "As I explained earlier and as the Agency has explained and the D.C. Circuit has explained, it is a health effect that rises to the level at which a medical professional would deem it to be a concern that should be treated. In this case, with respect to pulmonary effects, the Agency has always applied the standards of the American Thoracic Society. I understand, I do understand the question. You are asking for a determinant criterion, but this -- this Court's precedents have not and cannot require an agency with respect to an area where there are many different pollutants, many different kinds of health effects, many different kinds of health effects and many different kinds of science and scientific uncertainty to provide that criterion. She exercises her judgment and explains in the record in detail why she made the choice within the range provided her that she did, and for 20 years, the D.C. Circuit has had no problem applying arbitrary and capricious review to that.",
  "Justice --",
  "Of course. For the arbitrary and capricious review, she has to explain why she made the decision she made, given what the scientific data showed, what the legal factors are, what the -- and that's test --",
  "No, it's not.",
  "That is correct. May I reserve? May I reserve the balance of my time?",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The state of Ohio is asking this Court to rule that the administrator may not revise national ambient air quality standards for ozone, and that even if she can revise them, that she cannot implement them either for primary or secondary standards. The District of Columbia Circuit held, in a judgment that no one petitioned from, that the clear language of the statute requires EPA to revise and, as appropriate, promulgate new standards for ozone, and that nothing in Section 181 in any respect impairs her ability to enforce the secondary standard, which is identical, and we think, therefore, that those questions are not properly before the Court. What is before the Court is the question of whether, having resolved the legal question before it, which is the challenge to EPA's authority to revise and provide a new standard, the Court of Appeals acted properly in going beyond that and opining, based on some preamble language, to the new rule that EPA promulgated, that EPA could either not implement the new primary standard, or implement it only in conformity with subpart (2), which are the specific implementation provisions that Congress enacted in 1990 for the 1-hour ozone standard. We think -- we have two submissions. First, there was -- the Court of Appeals did not properly address the issue of how EPA will implement the new standard that it said it had authority to set, because EPA has not undertaken any final agency action to do so, and the time for doing so has not yet come. Second of all, the question is, because it hasn't engaged in the notice and comment rulemaking about how to implement the 8-hour standard, the EPA has not -- the Court of Appeals decision is perforce phrased in terms of such a high level of abstraction that not even any of the respondents can agree what the Court of Appeals meant when it said in its third try at this that EPA may implement the 8-hour standard only in conformity with subpart (2), and therefore we think that the Court of Appeals should not have reached this issue. The administrator will engage in notice and comment rulemaking specifying how the Act is to be implemented at the time that she promulgates the area designations that the states have provided to her and sets the schedule for what are called state implementation plans, and at that point she will have issued a rule and undertaken an action supported by an explanation that this, or the Court of Appeals could review. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court. For 30 years, the EPA has consistently interpreted the Clean Air Act to require that NAAQS be set solely by reference to the effects of a pollutant's presence in the air. Costs and other factors relating to removing the pollutant are accounted for under the statute in the process of implementing the standards. That interpretation reflects the plain meaning of the statute and the intent uniformly expressed both by the D.C. Circuit and the legislative history of this technology-forcing act.",
  "The EPA -- we concede that the EPA can consider countervailing health concerns that derive from the presence of the pollutant in the air, for example, the health, the health cancer problem, but we do not concede, and the Court of Appeals has unanimously upheld our determination that we cannot consider any factors, economic or health, that don't derive from the presence of the pollutant in the ambient air because that's what Section 108(a)(2) requires.",
  "Yes.",
  "We can --",
  "No. We don't concede that.",
  "Here's the difference.",
  "I'm not sure it's important either, but if it might be, I'll address it. The UVB question, that is the question about whether, well, this tropospheric ozone might be even at elevated levels that cause people to die might be protecting against skin cancer was a case of first impression for the EPA in this case. It had never, there had never been such a claim made for any of the other six criteria pollutants in any of the five-year reviews. The EPA's initial determination, which it defended in the Court of Appeals, was that it was not appropriate to consider that, but the Court of Appeals held otherwise, we have acquiesced and the EPA is in fact very well along in the process of evaluating and characterizing those countervailing health effects that derive from the presence of the pollutant in the air.",
  "It's -- you're referring to the --",
  "-- standard that is set for ozone.",
  "And I don't think that the standard --",
  "I believe it is --",
  "I am certain that in either the criteria documents, the staff papers, the CASAC concurrence letters or the preamble, it specifies that in detail, but I'm afraid that I can't tell you the answer. When CASAC -- CASAC concurred unanimously that an eight-hour measuring period should be substituted for the one-hour period.",
  "I believe that's right, but I am not a -- I'm not even in the realm of being a scientist, and I -- I would want to be more certain before I said it, but it's not, it's not just --",
  "It is in fact the three-year average of the annual fourth highest daily eight-hour average, if that's clear.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. Both by the agency --",
  "Okay first of all, costs are -- the statute requires the EPA to do a risk assessment analysis which was referred to earlier, and that be provided to the states and Congress, and Congress routinely reviews this to determine whether to adjust the enforcement burdens that the statute applies.",
  "Yes, it can, in the following respects. First, if a state fails to create a SIP, a state implementation plan, EPA must do it and in doing its own implementation plan for one of the 3,000 areas in the country, it must reference all of that data, as if it were a state. Secondly --",
  "I have a whole list.",
  "Which I hope will answer your question. Leaving aside question of postponement of the dates and extensions of time, the EPA must use that data to determine what control technique guidelines will be imposed with respect to ozone in particular. It must use that data in determining what requirements to place on light duty truck emissions. It also must use that data to set performance standards for new stationary sources of air pollution and for new motor vehicles. The theme here is, as I said before, we have in essence a two-part statute. Part one is set the standard. And part two is implementation, which also imposes lots of regulatory obligations on EPA itself.",
  "No.",
  "It may not make that judgment, and the reason is, as you suggested in I believe in an earlier question that that judgment was specifically and expressly left to Congress. The Senate report which accompanied promulgation of the 1970 act, at pages 2 and 3 and 10 expressly reflect Congress' judgment that that determination is to be left for Congress upon reviewing a technology-forcing statute in which costs will not be considered.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. They cannot -- EPA can --",
  "They can't. Congress has provided, for example, with respect to attainment of the standard under a state implementation program that attainment must be achieved within five years, but EPA can extend it for another five years and then give two additional one-year extensions, all by referencing questions of costs, feasibility, etc. The EPA -- I want to address the legislative history in a moment because the history both before and after the 1970 acts is very revealing here.",
  "No. I don't think so at all. The first thing that Congress did after it passed the '70 act was to provide in 1977 that the standards should be reviewed and revised every five years. Now, that is a provision that is codified in Section 109(d). It's a new provision, and it's significant because what it says is that the revisions shall be made in the same manner as the original standards are set, by reference to the criteria documents and Section 109(b). Now, I think that one of the things one can glean, one of the many things one can glean from the legislative history, is that when Congress did that in 1977, it knew repeatedly without any doubt and from a commission that it itself asked to look at this question, that the EPA was setting the standards without reference to costs or other implementation factors, and yet, it required the EPA to revise the standards every five years and expressly said that they are to do so in the same manner as which the original standards are set. There was, in particular, a 1970 Congressional Research Service Report, 1975, Congressional Research Service Report that was asked to look at this question, and outlined the debate over whether to retain the effects of the pollutants as the sole criteria of standard setting, and Congress did that in 1977. But it went further, Justice Kennedy. It also directed that another commission, an independent commission, be established to look at this question, and that commission reported to Congress in 1981, and it said, \"the current statutory criteria and requirements for setting air quality standards at the levels necessary to protect public health without considering economic factors should remain unchanged.\" And when Congress revised the statute in 1990, that's exactly what it did. And both the House and the Senate reports accompanying the 1990 legislation said that primary NAAQS are \"set at a level that protects the public health with an adequate margin of safety without regard to the economic or technical feasibility of attainment. This Court itself said in the Union Electric case, construing the Clean Air Act, and I'm quoting, \"when Congress intended the administrator to be concerned about economic or technological feasibility, it has expressly so provided.\" And in the Benzene case, which my opponent has cited but which I think strongly supports us, the Court said, and I am quoting, \"when Congress has intended that an agency engage in cost/benefit analysis, it has clearly indicated such intent on the face of the statute.\" Now there, this Court determined that before OSHA could lower the level for a particular toxic material or hazard physical agent below an existing standard, it had to determine that there was a significant risk to safety. And that determination was to be made without reference to cost/benefit analysis, and if I can just say one thing with respect to the previous argument, that standard, significant risk to safety, has no more countervailing extraneous factors imported into it than the public health adequate margin of safety requisite standard that exists here. In fact, this Court went on at length to say that it doesn't require mathematical precision and there will be a range of factors and that judgment has to be rendered and that the court will simply have to review whether the decision is arbitrary or capricious.",
  "Well, the EPA reasonably interprets the Clean Air Act as not either requiring or permitting it to set levels that are at or below background levels, and it has never yet, I mean, you know, science inexorably creeps forward, but the EPA has never set, found a level necessary, for example, to eliminate the internal combustion engine. In fact, with respect to ozone, the first time the EPA changed the standard, it changed the standard from a .08 one-hour standard, which is much stricter than what we have here, to a .12 one-hour standard. That is, it relaxed it and of course, it was, this goes to Justice Scalia's question from a while ago, it relaxed it and of course the American Lung Association and others came running in and saying that's ridiculous. You know, how can you be relaxing the standard? Health effects could occur. And you know I commend the D.C. Circuit's opinion, in, it's called American Petroleum Institute vs. Kostill for an analysis of why there are, in fact, countervailing factors that would permit an administrator exercising judgment within the zone of reasonableness to raise the standard. Now, I want to say something about your, your earlier question about what if the costs were so astronomical to require us to deindustrialize, although deindustrialization would be quite unhealthy, and was quite unhealthy. I want to say two things. First of all, Congress has made a rational decision that with respect to what it viewed and characterized as the most serious problem facing America in 1970, which was air pollution, that it wanted to create an agency, an expert agency that would rely on science and the latest scientific knowledge to do as step one, just tell us. We recognize this is going to be hard. We recognize that some of these chemicals are \"nonthreshold,\" but tell us, based on your best judgment what level would be safe to set for the whole country. And then, establishes a program for how to achieve the levels by balancing the burdens between cars and stationary sources of pollution. But secondly, the EPA was -- the EPA has always done cost estimates at the time that it promulgates the criteria documents so that the states can use them in implementing. And retrospective -- looking retrospectively, every single one of those cost estimates has vastly overstated the actual cost/benefit analysis of what it took to meet that level.",
  "Well, Justice O'Connor, the reason is that when it sets the standard, it is -- and this is, I'm making reference to the language of Sections 108 and 109 of the act, which are reprinted at pages 109-A through 112-A of the appendix to our petition. They're in several other places. The standards must be set, it says this in 109, based on the criteria. And in 108(a)(2), it says that the criteria shall accurately reflect the latest scientific knowledge useful in indicating the kind and extent of all identifiable effects on public health or welfare which may be expected from the presence of such pollutant in the ambient air, so that does not look at --",
  "-- so that does not look at -- it does -- when it sets the standard, should it be .08 or .09 or 3.5, when it sets the standard, it does not look at, are there electric cars or not electric cars or are there scrubbers for SO2 emissions or not? It sets the standard at what is requisite to protect public health from the effects of that ubiquitous pollutant, but once those standards are set, it is then up to the states and EPA to determine one, what areas within our jurisdictions don't meet those general standards, and then --",
  "It's not a consideration in setting the standards, and the point that I wanted to make. I didn't successfully make it. Is that time and again with respect to each one of these standards, there have been complaints that this would require 10 horrible things. With respect to the original standards, which then authorize the EPA to set tailpipe emissions for new cars. This is discussed extensively in some of the amicus briefs. The automobile industry stated publicly that it was impossible to meet those standards, and if it were possible, the companies would go bankrupt. As it turns out, the standard -- the companies did develop the technology. They met the standards well ahead of the schedule that EPA and Congress had revised and as a result with respect to all six of the criteria pollutants, the health in this country is vastly better now than it was in 1970, even though we have a much bigger population and we have a much greater level of industrialization.",
  "Well, I don't think -- well, this is a --",
  "Well, Justice O'Connor, that would be a question for Congress because everybody understands and Congress has said that it does not expect or allow the EPA to regulate to zero biological risk. It regulates to a --",
  "It does. It does. With respect. It says that standards must be set at levels that are requisite, that is necessary, but not more than necessary to protect against, not all effects, but public health effects arising from the presence of the pollutant in the air, which the agency and the courts, supported by the legislative history, interpret as meaning effects that are of medical significance that affect a sufficiently significant proportion of the population that the administrator in her judgment can conclude reasonably that it constitutes a public health effect. Now --",
  "That is correct.",
  "Treatability is a -- is one of the factors that goes -- that builds into the accepted medical profession's definition of what constitutes an adverse health effect. But it would also -- may I just finish the answer? It would also never be required because the EPA, the statute, this is not a statute that requires or permits the EPA to take our society to zero, to take our society below what otherwise occurs in the air without all of this man-made pollution-inducing activity.",
  "That is correct. She is --",
  "I don't know whether or not it's possible or not, Justice Breyer, but I will say this. In 30 years under this act, and this act is -- this act is the premiere example of the point that Justice Kennedy was expressing for the Court in Loving of cooperation between two different branches under the separation, under the permissible separation of powers to achieve a result. Congress has over and over and over again adjusted implementation issues in response to problems of cost and feasibility, but never, it has never done either of the following two things. It has never changed a NAAQS. Never said no, that's too low, we'll have to deindustrialize, and it has never changed the factors that EPA considers and doesn't consider in setting NAAQS.",
  "Not that I'm aware of, although in some of the rate-making cases, I think it was probably apparent from the context. I mean, my colleague cites Hope Natural Gas, which was not a nondelegation case, but it was apparent from the context. But I think the interesting point, Justice Kennedy, is that this Court has decided many cases in which it is clear that it was neither necessary nor important. Benzene is the best possible example of that. But it is also true in other cases. I mean, if one can go all the way back to --",
  "A cost/benefit analysis in determining in either making the statute constitutional under the nondelegation doctrine, or providing a sufficient principle for determining what is a significant safety risk. But the other case that just comes to mind is, in many ways -- the first nondelegation case of the last century, the Stranahan case, Buttfield vs. Stranahan in which Congress passed a law that told the Secretary of the Treasury for some reason to set uniform rates for the quality of tea and to prohibit the importation of any tea that did not meet those standards. Now, there's no indication in the record in the case that cost/benefit analysis went into the determination of what an appropriate standard for tea quality was, and it's frankly hard to imagine how it would have been done so. In my few remaining minutes, I would like to address my comments to the argument that somehow the words public health requires this Court, notwithstanding 20 years of D.C. Circuit precedent to the contrary, to require some form of cost/benefit analysis. And I have five points to make with respect to that in my remaining time. First of all, the legislative history, the 1970 legislative history reflects that Congress intended the plain meaning of public health to mean to protect populations, not the most sensitive person as is the case in the OSHA Benzene context. Number two, if you look at Section 108(a) of the act, which determines what criteria are, it is the effects on public health of the presence of the pollutant in the air that is being ascertained and costs does not make sense in that context. There are also, as Justice Scalia pointed out, many provisions of the Clean Air Act that require consideration of both costs and public health, and they are collected in the brief of Massachusetts and New Jersey at page 29. Well -- penultimately, the Winslow definition, the 1951 definition that ATA cites is a definition of the profession of public health, the discipline of public health. There is no showing in this record or in the legislative history that that case, that that definition was ever even cited in -- by 1970, much less brought to the attention of Congress. And there is no showing whatsoever in the legislative history that that definition was interpreted that way before 1970. I mean, it would require Section 109(b) to say that NAAQS must be set at the level requisite to protect the profession of public health with an adequate margin of safety. And in fact, there is a reference to the fact that all public health organizations agree you can only determine this with respect to costs, at page 36, footnote 27 of our principle brief on this appeal, we reference and describe the expressed views of the American Public Health Association which is the national umbrella organization for public health professionals, which specifically has endorsed the process that EPA uses for setting the NAAQS standard. In short, there is nothing in Section 108 or 109 that permits EPA to set a level inadequate to protect the public health because of the costs of compliance. If there are no further questions.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: I think perhaps I'll -- I've had enough questions in the first 15 minutes to keep me fully occupied --",
  "I would welcome any and all questions as always. I want to start first by -- I do want to address the Pentagon Papers point and the point that Justice Kennedy made about using information obtained on the radio to talk with his own wife or make his own decisions and Justice O'Connor's question about what difference does it make how get it. I first want to make the point because there is been some suggestion I think here that it is the Government's position that the First Amendment does not -- the First Amendment interests here don't require heightened scrutiny. That's not our position. We do recognize that there is an important burden on First Amendment rights here, but we submit that the appropriate level of scrutiny is intermediate-level scrutiny because this is a totally content-neutral law of general applicability that protects fundamental values of privacy and private speech and denies third parties nothing that they otherwise would have had if the act's prohibition on interception itself was fully effective --",
  "Well, I think that is so here, and I also think that that is not an accurate characterization of all the intermediate-scrutiny cases. I mean, it was not true, for example, in Cohen v. Cowles Media or in Zacchini and Harper & Row.",
  "That's exactly right and that's --",
  "Right. And that's why -- that's why we think that unlike Cohen v. Cowles Media where the Court applied no heightened First Amendment scrutiny and the dissenters objected on that ground, we think that heightened scrutiny is appropriate here, because there is a restraint on speech. But it is not a restraint on -- with respect to any topic, any viewpoint, any speaker. If these -- anybody who gets wire tapped information or information from a bug planted in my home or my conference room -- gets the information otherwise, the identical information is fully available for speech or other use. In other words, what's missing here --",
  "That is absolutely true and that is why heightened scrutiny applies. It is our submission that it's significant that if the same information comes from any other source, it can be used or disseminated with impunity which is another way I think, of what I'm trying to suggest, which is that there is no suggestion here, unlike the Pentagon Papers case, or the Florida Star line of cases of a censorial motive by the Government, an effort to take certain facts off the table, and the reason that the --",
  "Justice Kennedy, I'm not suggesting that we win because intermediate-level scrutiny applies. I have three reasons that I'd like to articulate why we think we do, but I certainly acknowledge the fact that the -- a restriction on speech under intermediate- level scrutiny may fail just as heightened scrutiny like in cases like Bursen v. Freeman and Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce can sometimes prevail. My point here is, and this goes to the distinction with the Pentagon Papers case and I think to Justice O'Connor's initial question about why we should care how the information came to be, is that the knowing use of illegally intercepted private expression implicates other constitutional values as this Court recognized in Cox and Florida Star and in particular the distinction between information that is leaked from the Government or otherwise that is leaked as the result of a failure of a trusted responsibility, which was at issue in Florida Star and perhaps at issue in Landmark and certainly was at issue in the Pentagon Papers case, where this Court has said repeatedly that in that instance, where we're talking about information that was not unlawfully obtained, but instead was disclosed to the public as a result of a failure of a trust relationship, there is quote, almost -- there are almost always less drastic means of resolving the problem, both because you can be more careful about who you trust, and secondly, there is a much smaller universe of potential violators. Here we're talking about an interception which almost by definition is impossible of detection. People don't even know that their conversations at home or at work are being overheard, let alone who did it and this case is a perfect --",
  "Well, I don't think -- I do understand your point Justice Kennedy, I would quarrel with your characterization of this as tainted speech that you can't do anything about. Again, because it doesn't look at the topic or the subject or anything. It simply says that if you know that this is the result of an illegal intrusion into a zone of conversational privacy, you cannot use it until it becomes publicly known. And I also -- I'm not sure that it is fair to say that there is no precedent for taking speech like this off the table. I think we have talked about Seattle Times and Cowles and Harper & Row and Zacchini but there is also the San Francisco arts case involving use of the word Olympic. There is trade secret law which relates to fact and not expression. There are grand jury secrecy rules and rules under the Conic Pickering test about what employers --",
  "-- and employees may or may not say.",
  "Well, I think that that's wrong; that is the scarcity of cases shows it because if you look at the cases, for example, that are reprinted in the appendix to our reply brief and in respondent Vopper's brief, a very large number of those cases involved use -- at least if you take out the marital cases -- involved use by third persons, and the deterrence or disincentive point which is one of the three points that we make support the importance of the use and disclosure provisions as a means of protecting conversational privacy, I think, depends just by the way just as the statute's exclusionary rule in 2515 does, it depends on the -- the common sense point that if you prohibit all means of exploiting stolen information, whether they are expressive means or not, you will lessen the incentive materially for many people to engage in the interception. Now, it's true there will be people who as a hobby just like to eavesdrop or intercept other people's conversations and the use --",
  "Well, we think, as we indicate in our brief that both the meaning of the word disclose which is in the statute and the legislative history demonstrates that the statute no longer applies once it is public information or common knowledge. And we also think -- we also think that -- well, that's our answer with respect to how far it goes, and it would also be an answer to Justice Kennedy --",
  "Excuse me?",
  "That's the -- the statute precludes that use of it. It's not addressed in this case, but the statute precludes all use of it. Now --",
  "Now, if there was --",
  "Well I -- there has never been a case, a reported case which is --",
  "There has never been a reported case in which there was either a prosecution or a civil suit brought here, and of course the plaintiffs in this case did not sue the school board members that were told about it. But the point it seems to me, is that what Congress was trying to protect here was not private facts and not to restrain speech on its own, but to protect the sanctity of what we all know to be critical to our society, which is the ability to speak in an uninhibited candid fashion. May I reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Questions about the extent of the necessity defense which we mentioned in our reply brief or the meaning of the word disclosure are all, of course, questions of application that will be given judicial interpretation in appropriate cases where they arise. The salient point here is that the respondents have not made a case, either in their briefs or here, that going solely against the wiretapper is going to significantly protect privacy. And contrary to their representation, the legislative history does, in fact, reflect both great solicitude for the privacy rights involved and that's quoted at page 3 of our reply brief and also repeatedly the recognition that wiretapping and bugging and now of course we have hacking into e-mails is almost completely impossible of interception or even detection. The nominal fine that Mr. Levine referred to Levine referred to is, of course, $5,000 which is not nominal with respect to most people, and in any event exists independent of the civil remedy under 2520 that Congress thought was appropriate and Congress said in the legislative history was appropriate to vindicate the privacy rights of the people whose privacy interests were not vindicated. The notion that there is a limiting principal for facts of public significance, I think, is fatal. First of all, if there were such an exception, that would not -- that would deprive the statute of being content neutral. And second of all, there is almost no way to draw the line, as Justice Scalia suggests, for what is publicly significant. This Court has already held twice that the name of a woman who has been raped, not the fact that there was a rape or the name of the perpetrator, but the victim is a matter of public significance and public interest. So we don't think that there is a constitutional way to draw a line here. The Daily Mail principle that the other side bases its case on is distinguishable from this case and this law in five critical respects. Those were laws that applied only to the press and not to nonexpressive uses. They were content based laws reflected a determination that society should not know certain information. They reflect -- they dealt with information that came from the Government that is not in the hands of private parties and there are, we understand, reasons to respect a sensorial motive when the Government seeks to limit disclosure of information about its own activities. They did not -- they all obtained -- involved information that was lawfully obtained. Every single one of the persons who gave that information to the person got it lawfully.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For over 25 years, courts have afforded injunctive relief against violations of Title VI regulations against State officials as well as other public officials and private officials. That practice is consistent with the expectations of the Congress that enacted Title VI, particularly considering the legal and social contexts that existed in 1964, and successive Congresses have validated the private right of action.",
  "Well, among other things, Mr. Chief Justice, the persistent practice of many local jurisdictions in evading the dictates of this Court and of Congress with respect to a variety of civil rights issues, the most prominent one being --",
  "Yes, local and State jurisdictions. For example, the kind of thing that prompted the Voting Rights Act of '65.",
  "Are you talking about against --",
  "Against States, or generally speaking, because the answer is yes --",
  "I think that it is utterly embedded. The cases, the decided cases are collected in Mr. -- in two appendices to Mr. Schnapper's brief, but with respect to States in particular -- I mean, let me speak first to the regulations issue and then to the States issue, which I take to be the State of Alabama's principal points. There is no case of which I am aware in which this Court has ever even suggested, much less held, that in determining the scope of a right of action, whether expressed or implied, that a distinction should be made between rights articulated in a statute itself, and rights articulated in substantive regulations that the statute mandates that the agency promulgate.",
  "This is a separation of powers issue.",
  "That's --",
  "I would like to make two points, Justice Souter, in response to that observation, with which I agree. First of all, the implication of drawing the kind of distinction that's been suggested here has very, very broad ramifications beyond enforcement of civil rights statutes. If you look at the cases, either implied or under 1983, in which private parties have sought to enforce against State agencies obligations under the medicare and medicaid statutes, those are regulatory obligations. The contemporary legal context in which Title VI and the other civil rights provisions of the '64 act were enacted, as this Court recognized in Cannon and, in particular, in then-Justice Rehnquist's separate opinion in Cannon, were enacted in a regime in which it was understood that legislative silence with respect to a statute that created substantive rights for the benefit of individuals would be enforced by the courts in an implied right of action, and that existed in regulatory cases. We've talked about Borak. Merrill Lynch was decided somewhat later in 1982. The --",
  "Well -- no, no, no. It's quite right that those weren't against States, and Mr. Schnapper has cited some of the Title VI and Title IX cases that have operated against States. My only point on distinguishing between regulations and statutes for purpose of implying a right of action is that you will run into this Court's decided case law under the medicare and medicaid statutes whether under implied rights of action or under 1983, the Wright, Wilder, Blessing --",
  "They were --",
  "I wish I were more expert in medicare and medicaid regulations. My understanding --",
  "If --",
  "I will gladly take guidance from you, Justice Scalia, on this, but I believe that those statutes, like others in 1983 actions against State officials, involved both substantive and interpretive regulations and, of course, if you were going to draw a distinction here, it would drive a wedge right through the heart of this Court's cases, including Chrysler Corporation v. Brown and Chevron, that hold that substantive regulations that are mandated by statute have the force of law. Let me go to the State point, the notion that States --",
  "Well, I don't think I can do better than simply to repeat what I -- the point I hope that I had made, which is, there is no case suggesting that for purposes of enforcing a Spending Clause obligation there is a distinction in recognizing a cause of action based on a statute, or on regulations that the funding agency is mandated to put forward. The principle --",
  "Correct. What we have on our side is, I believe, a completely unbroken practice of enforcing obligations under both the Spending Clause and otherwise equally, whether they arise within the four corners of the statute, or under substantive regulations that are mandated by the statute. Now, I understand that this -- that our position puts great weight on the validity of these regulations, but that point, as the court of appeals noted, was expressly conceded by the State below, and we don't think that it's at issue here. With respect to the implication of a, an implied private right of action against a State official, which was Mr. Sutton's first point, Mr. Schnapper cited some of the cases under Title VI and its cognate statutes, but I think it's also important to recognize not only the long line of 1983 cases, many of which enforce Spending Clause statutes and their regulations in injunctive action, but also the point that Justice Kennedy made in his dissent in Golden State Transit for himself and Justice O'Connor and the Chief Justice, which is that there may be instances in which a healthy disagreement may arise as to whether a particular provision of Federal law creates a right, privilege, or immunity, but when what is being sought is injunctive relief, prospective relief only against a State official, the courts have long recognized a cause of action under the Supremacy Clause, Sections 1331 and 2201, including in Spending Clause cases which we have cited and discussed probably too briefly in footnote 12 of our brief. Cases like Blum v. Bacon and Lead-Deadwood are Spending Clause cases -- Blum was, even involved a regulation -- in which a suit was brought by a private party against the State official saying, look, the State has a policy. It's reflected in a regulation or a statute that operates in a manner that's inconsistent with Federal law and therefore it is preempted, and the background principle, the principle of law, I respectfully submit, that Mr. Sutton is advocating runs directly contrary to the particular cases we cited under Title VI and its cognate statutes and 1983, but also this more underlying, long line of cases that includes but goes well beyond Spending Clause precedents. Our position fundamentally in this case is that for 25 years, it is true, Mr. Chief Justice, there is not a holding directly on point that says, you may have a private right of action to enforce the Title VI regulations, but there -- for 25 years at least there has been a shared understanding among the three branches, reflected in a unanimous set of, body of case law from the federal courts, from successive congressional enactments. In addition to the attorney's fees amendment, the Rehabilitation Act amendments, and the Civil Rights Restoration Act, Congress has enacted 11 cognate civil rights statutes in which the funding agencies are expressly directed to promulgate regulations patterned after those under Title VI, all against a backdrop in which, at least since Lau v. Nichols and running up to the present, implied rights of action against State public agencies and other public agencies have been adjudicated, and the executive branch across administrations -- I've pulled out briefs filed on behalf of the United States by my predecessors, Robert Bork and Rex Lee, explaining to the Court that the implied private right of action to enforce these cases, and I believe that the former one was in Alexander, which was a case against a State, are important for the -- an important complement to Federal enforcement officials. Our brief in Darrone said, quote, the award of individual relief to a private litigant who has prosecuted her own suit is not only sensible but is fully consistent with and, in some cases, even necessary to the orderly enforcement of the statute. If there are no further questions, we'll submit.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Perhaps with that observation, I would -- it would behoove me to address the quest -- the appellate jurisdiction of this Court first, as much as I would like to rush into why there clearly is subject matter jurisdiction in this case, regardless of whether the plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief are viewed as separate and distinct or common and then divide it. So let me first address why I think the Ninth Circuit and this Court had appellate jurisdiction, and it is straightforward. That is, there is an appeal in this case from the dismissal with prejudice of a consolidated complaint which was filed voluntarily by the plaintiffs in this case seeking -- as against plaintiffs that are different than any -- than the constituent State court actions, including different plaintiffs seeking different causes of action and seeking a different form of relief, that is, specific performance of the Ford rebate program. And it is very clear, both from the cont -- the --the four corners of the consolidated complaint and from an express representation that my friend, Mr. Berman, made at the oral argument in the class certification stage, that the consolidated complaint was filed for the purpose of obtaining, in front of Judge Dwyer in the Northern Dis -- the Western District of Washington, a judgment on the merits in the case. That is, it was different than the treatment, the maximum treatment, that he would have been permitted to provide under the multi-district litigation panel's reference. That is --",
  "That is --",
  "Indeed, and that, Justice Scalia, is the -- is the question I believe, the specific question, that the Court directed the parties' attention to in its request for supplemental briefs. Now, it is clear that a prevailing party normally cannot appeal, but the operative word that this Court has recognized, at least since the Electrical Fittings case, is normally. And this Court and the lower courts have applied a rather particular test to determine when normally doesn't apply, and that is, is the nominally prevailing party sufficiently aggrieved by a decision in its favor that it retains a, quote, stake in the appeal? And that's -- that test was articulated by this Court in Guaranty Trust v. Roper --",
  "-- and in Forney v. Apfel.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, the appealability of the dismissal with prejudice of the consolidated complaint does not depend on whether the consolidated complaint, quote, did away with the other actions. The reason -- we would, of course, readily concede that under 1447(d), if all that had happened was a removal of the six State court actions, a transfer for pretrial purposes to a multi-district litigation court and a determination by that court that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the complaints, there would be no appeal because the remand of removed State court actions for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, Congress has decided, is not a determination that may be reviewed by Federal appellate courts. But here -- and this, I think, is the salient point. Here, the judge did not require the plaintiffs' lawyers in the six cases to file some sort of concordance or a consolidating document that often is ordered so as to facilitate pretrial proceedings. What the judge said is if anybody wants to file a consolidated complaint, they may. The consolidated complaint that was filed in this case avowedly invoked this Court's 13 -- the Federal court's 1332 jurisdiction and sought not just pretrial consolidated proceedings on discovery and motions, they wanted a full trial or a full resolution on the merits. In other words, it's -- it's as if the judge, having had the six cases transferred, said expressly, look, I'm going to deal with all of the pretrial matters that are the subject of this transfer order, but if you all like me --",
  "No, no, no. I'm -- I'm not explaining myself correctly. The -- the order doesn't say these six removed cases are here for trial purposes, and if it did, it would exceed the court's authority under 1407 and this Court's specific holding in Lexecon. On page 41 of the joint appendix, the court under a heading say -- entitled consolidated complaint says, should plaintiffs in all or some of the consolidated actions decide to file a consolidated complaint, you have to do so within a certain period of time. Now, that raises the question, since they did it voluntarily, whether what they were filing was something that, in essence, sort to -- as I said, to be a concordance, to consolidate in one document all of the various parties and all the various claims and all various theories so that a court can meaningful and -- meaningfully and efficiency -- efficiently manage the pretrial proceedings.",
  "That -- that's true, Mr. Chief Justice, although there are instances where the court -- where the transferee court has ordered the filing of something called a consolidated complaint. But here, there are two salient -- at least two salient differences. One is this complaint has different parties. It has different causes of action. It seeks a different type of relief. And at the motion -- and -- and it seeks quite clearly, based on the conduct of the parties and the representations, this is, in essence, saying thank you very much for having -- having us here for consolidated proceedings on our underlying state court actions, but we have decided we like you, Judge Dwyer, and we want you to try a case, and we're going to file a brand new Federal action that is docketed in the Western District.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, it certainly could have been, and if it were ordered by the court, that is the most that it could have been. But in this case, that's not what it was. There are parties, claims, and requests for relief, and particularly the -- what is really the object of the litigation, the request for specific performance of the Ford rebate program --",
  "That -- I think your premise -- the premise of your question, Justice Stevens, with respect, is incorrect, which is if we had asked for a dismissal on subject matter jurisdiction grounds and prevailed -- that is, we would have --",
  "If we had asked for it, then we would have gotten all that we could possibly have expected. What we asked for -- what happened in this case was they voluntarily filed it. They asked for trial and judgment on the merits. The court sua sponte said, I don't think I have subject matter jurisdiction, and we have the right to appeal that because we are sufficiently aggrieved that we have a stake in the case. And the --",
  "Yes, because of the amount in controversy. It refused to apply -- it followed prior Ninth Circuit precedent and refused to apply the defendants' viewpoint in a class action seeking injunctive --",
  "We would have been aggrieved in the same way -- because what we sought was -- what we wanted was litigation in a single forum, in a forum which had already conducted substantial pretrial proceedings and a Federal forum. We sought judgment in our favor on the merits. What we -- which would have produced a dismissal or a judgment with prejudice. What we received, but did not ask for, was a result that permits the -- either these plaintiffs or anybody else in the country to continue this litigation in State court. And -- and their -- the lower courts in the cases that we've cited are --",
  "Well, I think, this Court's decision in Forney v. Apfel stands for that proposition. But it would -- this is an easier case because we did not seek to dismiss this for subject matter jurisdiction grounds. We wanted to be in Federal court. We were the ones who removed the underlying State court actions here. As it turns out, they decided they wanted to be in Federal court too. But there are a long line of cases, and really an uninterrupted line of cases, in the lower courts that have interpreted this Court's jurisprudence in Forney and Guaranty Trust and Electrical Fittings to mean that where there is a dismissal on -- of State law claims, not on the merits, but for lack of jurisdiction, defendants are aggrieved in a practical sense. And we've discussed a --",
  "Not -- with respect, Justice Ginsburg, maybe I -- perhaps I'm not understanding you. I -- there's an interesting epistemological question in this case whether the underlying State court actions continue to exist or whether they had been, in fact, superseded but the --",
  "You mean --",
  "Well --",
  "I -- with respect, Justice Souter, if -- there are plaintiffs in two of the State cases who are not even named plaintiffs in the Federal case. There are defendants. There is a defendant.",
  "Well, the -- all of the cases seek a nationwide class.",
  "Well --",
  "There are -- I'll go to door number two. There are claims. There are causes of action in the underlying State cases that are not included in the consolidated complaint and vice versa. In short, the -- the -- from a case management perspective, whether both a Federal case and a State case that are both in existence can go forward simultaneously or whether one should follow the other is something that happens all the time, and it has never been understood to divest one court or the other of jurisdiction. And our submission here is that we have something that is distinctly new. It was --",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, in point of fact, Justice Souter, if this Court reverses the Ninth Circuit for the -- for -- for one of the two errors of law that it committed, and on remand, the conclusion is made that there is subject matter jurisdiction and the case can proceed, we will be in precisely the same posture that we were in at the time that the plaintiffs filed the consolidated complaint.",
  "And -- well, the State cases have not yet been remanded, but if the State --",
  "They had been removed.",
  "And they will remain removed if this -- if a Federal court concludes that there is subject matter jurisdiction.",
  "There is a single order in the case that says there is no jurisdiction. And it's in the -- in the joint appendix. There is no subject matter jurisdiction over the consolidated complaint or over the six removed actions. And therefore, the consolidated complaint is dismissed, and the clerk is directed to remand the underlying State actions back to the States. Now, that order was stayed by the Ninth Circuit at our request pending the outcome of this case. That is, if --",
  "No. After -- yes, it was stayed prior to argument there and --",
  "It would have except that we moved for a stay of the mandate. The mandate issued before the court ruled on it, and the court then recalled the mandate and directed that the remand of the underlying State actions not proceed until this Court -- at least until this Court -- has resolved the question. But ultimately --",
  "Not true, Justice Souter, for two reasons. I'll give the broader one first. If we had filed as all parties in the case and the Solicitor General as well agree is the complete functional equivalent of the consolidated complaint -- if Ford and Citi had filed a declaratory judgment action in Federal court, even after the State cases had been filed, before or after they had been removed, and we asked for a declaration that we can terminate the Ford rebate program, there would be no question that --",
  "I -- as I'm standing here, Justice Ginsburg, I -- I can't bring any cases to mind. I'll -- I'll -- I'll -- I'll try and bring one to mind prior to my rebuttal. But I don't understand what the objection would be if, before terminating the program, we said, we're going to terminate this program --",
  "-- and we want a declaration that --",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, if we were to have filed such a case -- and my submission is it would be the functional equivalent of a consolidated complaint -- it would not disempower plaintiffs or plaintiffs' representatives from filing their own class actions in State or Federal court. And if that were the case, there would then -- there would be -- thereafter be a determination made by the courts involved --",
  "-- as to whether it makes sense --",
  "I am -- I am sure that there are many such cases. I can't cite you one as I'm standing here.",
  "That's correct. I -- I know that our brief and the red brief and the Solicitor's General brief all address this scenario, but I can't bring to mind the cases. But just to get back to Justice Souter's question again, let me give you the ex -- in terms of whether, if we proceed here, a State case could go forward and -- and would go forward, If you take, for example, the Alabama case where there's no Alabama plaintiff here, they have not only not sought specific performance, they have disavowed any specific performance and brought separate claims on different theories. Since they haven't sought specific performance, there is no subject matter jurisdiction over the claim because we are -- and this Court basing subject matter jurisdiction on the cost of providing that performance -- the Alabama case can and presumably will go forward.",
  "Under this -- yes. Under this Court's -- under the Court's current jurisprudence, yes, we would. The only -- it would only be if this Court were to resolve the question it left open in Free v. Abbott Labs that we would then have some argument, or that the Court determined that punitive damages could be accumulated. But since they aren't asking for a specific performance -- and neither, by the way, are I think four other of the six cases. Since they're not asking for a specific performance, we don't have an argument under this Court's existing case law for keeping the cases there. And they could --",
  "I -- I don't know that I have the -- all of the details of the underlying cases in mind. But if they are simply a claim for damages and punitive damages in which the amount in controversy is not $75,000, and they aren't asking for specific performance, I don't think, consistent with the law of this case, we would have any basis for objecting to them going forward.",
  "Well, it's -- it is clear, Justice Ginsburg -- and if it isn't clear from the complaint, it is utterly clear from the -- from the plaintiffs' red brief in this case at page 45 that what they -- the object of this litigation is reinstatement of the national Ford credit rebate program under which they can earn credits toward the purchase of a Ford vehicle. They -- they're -- they don't -- none of these plaintiffs have a liquidated claim for damages because they're not asking that they be paid rebates that they earned and weren't paid. Those were credited to them. They are all asking for reinstatement of a program, which doesn't exist, that will allow them to earn credits, based on purchases, toward the purchase of a vehicle. And on the -- on the question of subject matter jurisdiction, the court below made two errors of law. First, it held incorrectly that class actions joining separate and distinct claims for injunctive relief cannot be viewed from the defendants' -- cannot be valued from the defendants' viewpoint. And secondly, it erred in concluding that the plaintiffs' interest in specific performance cannot be viewed as common and undivided. And if the Court has no questions at this time, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time and perhaps address the merits on rebuttal.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor. I'll use 1 minute on appellate jurisdiction and I hope 2 minutes on subject matter jurisdiction. On appellate jurisdiction, there is no doubt whatsoever that what was intended here was a new complaint about new things to proceed to judgment at trial. At page 11 of the transcript of oral argument before the district judge on the class certification issue, the court says, \"if a nationwide class were to be certified\" -- he's talking about the consolidated complaint -- \"would there be any need for further MDL proceedings, or would the whole litigation just be there in this one case for trial or other disposition? \"Mr. Berman: That is my understanding. There would be no further -- everyone has consented. All the plaintiffs' counsel and defendants have consented to have this case here.\" Justice Ginsburg, in response to your question about cases in which a declaratory judgment action was filed where it -- the case could have been litigated by a plaintiff class in a consumer case, that was the case in the Greenwood Trust case filed by a bank in the First Circuit that ultimately produced this Court's decision in Smiley which was a consumer class action that came up out of California. Now, with respect to specific performance, specific performance is the object of this complaint. It is what they want. It is the thing they need in order for any of them to be able to realize the benefits. And as this Court said in Mississippi & Missouri River Bridge v. Ward -- in that case, it involved removing a bridge obstruction -- the removal of the obstruction is the matter of the controversy and the value of the object must govern. The complaint itself says they want specific performance of the national rebate program, and if there were any clarification needed, you look at page 45 of the red brief and they explain that that's just what they want. If there were any --",
  "It's -- it would not if -- the Court may or may not grant specific performance of the national program in response to a particular plaintiff, but it would certainly not be a frivolous claim. Cases like that are brought all the time.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, first, the cost is -- the test is the cost of supplying the relief requested in the complaint to any one plaintiff, and that is class-wide relief. It would also cost a sufficient amount even if it were only one plaintiff.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Hernandez v. New York described a hypothetical case, a case in which the evidence of racial discrimination during jury selection was so strong that, quote, \"a finding of no discrimination is simply too incredible to be accepted.\" This is truly that exceptional case, and therefore the Court should use it as a model, a model of the weight of evidence sufficient to render objectively unreasonable a trial judge's rejection of a Batson challenge. Indeed, whatever --",
  "I want to embrace them, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "I fully recognize, as an officer of this Court and somebody who has followed this jurisprudence, that even on direct -- that the deference that is paid to a trial judge in a Batson hearing is so strong that even in Hernandez, this case said on direct review -- and Hernandez made reference to the high standards of proof in habeas -- even on direct review, we are going to require proof that a trial court's finding of fact in a Batson hearing is erroneous by clear and convincing evidence. And to that, AEDPA enacted subsection 2254(d)(2), which says that you -- a writ may not issue unless the State court adjudication resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented. There are very good reasons to provide these dual levels of deference to the trial judge. The trial judge in the case, of course, is the finder of fact, and in Hernandez this Court has made clear that the ultimate finding in this case, the finding of whether or not the trial prosecutor engaged in intentional discrimination in making race the tipping factor, a but-for factor with respect to the strike of any peremptory -- of any juror under a peremptory challenge -- is a factual determination. But (d)(2) and the clear and convincing evidence standard are there for a reason. They are there for the truly exceptional case in which there are reasons to believe that the trial judge's findings are deluded, and there are reasons to believe that the evidence suggesting that the trial judge's finding was unreasonable are overwhelming. And I'd like to address the first first and the second second, because I think it is entirely clear that given the facts of this case and the way in which the -- the trial judge in this case conducted the hearing, that whatever this Court decides, this case is going to stand as a benchmark, either that these facts represent an extreme that cannot be tolerated or that even these extreme facts are tolerable under Batson. Now, let me speak first to the trial judge. The trial judge was conscientious and he was, of course, to some extent disabled by the fact that the trial in this case immediately preceded this Court's decision in Batson. That is, this is one of these few cases where the trial occurred before Batson, but the case was pending on direct appeal when Batson was decided. And so we have in this case a trial judge who conducted the Batson hearing over 2 years after the jurors testified and after the trial prosecutors gave their reasons for all but two of the jurors. And therefore, the one hallmark of deference, which is that the trial judge is a percipient witness of the res gestae, if you will, did not exist in this case. The -- the decided cases under the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reflect significantly more than a dozen cases decided by this judge in that 2-year interim period. He saw thousands of venire members and undoubtedly heard hundreds, if not thousands, of Batson explanations. And moreover, whereas it is true that the trial judge observes the demeanor of the witnesses and a prosecutor can certainly use as a race-neutral reason questions raised about a juror's fitness or suitability based on demeanor, the objections in this case, with one limited exception, the prosecutor said nothing about the demeanor. The prosecutor's stated objections to the 10 of the 11 African Americans who were struck were substantive reasons there on the record. In addition, the trial judge in this case did not --",
  "I can -- I -- I embrace that, Mr. Chief Justice. For many years before I entered this line of work, I was a trial lawyer and I can remember exercising peremptory strikes just because of hesitation. My only limited point here is that unlike many voir dire hearings -- and I've now reviewed many -- there was only one single isolated instance in which the prosecutor, in giving his reasons either at the time or in the Batson hearing, said he hesitated or his demeanor led me to question it. And so in that one respect, I -- again I think this case is more susceptible to meaningful appellate review. But I have two more points I think it's very important for the Court to consider about the way this trial judge conducted this unusual case.",
  "Oh, no. It was direct appeal. The case was tried. There was an immediate appeal taken. During the -- right after -- I think a month after the case was tried, Batson was decided, and 2 years later, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals abated -- the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals said 10 of 11 African Americans were struck. That raises an inference of discrimination under Batson. Remand it for a Batson hearing. And it was at that hearing that the judge made the findings of fact and conclusions of law that are reflected in the -- in the joint appendix. There was a subsequent habeas proceeding in the State courts, but the habeas proceeding didn't deal with the Batson issue because it had been fully exhausted. The trial judge, in evaluating Batson, did not look at the very substantial evidence of pattern and practice evidence with respect to what was going on in Dallas County at this time, evidence that the magistrate deemed appalling. He was told by the State not to look at it. He did not consider what the State acknowledges to be racially disparate -- disparate questioning of the jurors in venire on the question -- their ability to impose a minimum sentence --",
  "We -- we don't know to a certainty that he didn't. He was told by the State that all of that evidence was irrelevant. Indeed, the State took the position that a -- that comparative evidence between white jurors and black jurors was irrelevant. That was the ground on which they urged this Court to deny the petition for certiorari on direct appeal. All I can say is it's nowhere reflected in the district judge's opinion. The -- the trial judge's opinion addresses only the six jurors in question that my predecessor claimed were struck in violation of Batson.",
  "He did. And there's an ambiguity, and that's why we think, interestingly, that this case is a (d)(2) case rather than a (d)(1) case. In this Court, as opposed to in the State courts, the State of Texas is here before you saying the judge considered everything. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals considered everything. They don't have to discuss everything that they considered, and therefore, there is no legal error that was committed. And our submission to you is I don't know if that's right or not. It doesn't appear to be right, but whether it's right or not, the result that they reached, the conclusion that they made that there was no -- that -- that race was not a but for factor with respect to not one, not two, but six of these people. Under the record of this case and in light of the way they conducted the jury shuffle in this case, which cannot be justified on non-racial grounds --",
  "I'll address the newspaper articles first, I guess you were asking about, and also the manual.",
  "The newspaper articles -- there were two series of newspaper articles. There were three articles that came out in the first or second week of March which was either just as the 4 or 5 weeks of jury selection was closing or after it, but it was before the trial began. And those articles precipitated the -- what was called a Swain challenge but it -- what became a Swain-Batson challenge. There were -- there were other articles that were subsequently issued after the -- after the trial in the case but before the direct appeal and the Batson remand that looked at the racial percentages in capital cases which mirrored the -- in many ways the -- the March 9th article that examined jury selection in 100 felony cases. Now, the manual. There were two manuals in the case. One of them, the earlier, more explicit 1963 manual, was not offered. It is discussed in the March 9th Dallas Morning News article which was admitted in evidence at the Batson hearing. The other manual, the John Sparling manual -- Mr. Sparling testified. There was testimony in the case by Judge Baraka and one other witness -- and it may have been Mr. Sparling -- that they were not sure when the manual ceased to be used. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in a case called Halliburton concluded that the manual was in use at least through the early 1980's I think or in -- by 1980 or something like --",
  "This trial was '86 I believe. But one of the things that's most striking in the case is -- there's -- there -- it is clear that at least one of the two prosecutors in this case was trained by this office at a time when the manual was concededly in use. The other one may have been. But one of the things that I found striking, just going through the juror information cards yesterday actually in preparing for the oral argument, which appear in the joint lodging at pages 54 to 108 -- these are the juror cards that people get, the prosecutors and trial lawyers get, before voir dire begins. If you look at what is noted there, the race and the gender and religion and beards and things like that, there is a remarkable coincidence with the issues and factors that are specifically addressed in the Sparling training manual. It's not our submission that it's proof they were trained by it. It's not our submission that they adhered to it or they used it. We're using this pattern and practice evidence just as a --",
  "The answer must be that they were put on at different times. If you look at the notations that say -- the race and the gender notations, each one has it.",
  "Those had to have been put on before any questioning occurred because there -- they are on those cards for jurors that were never reached or were never questioned. There are other notations about answers that appear to be in different handwriting, and I don't think the record shows it at all, but you can infer that they were noted at the same time that the prosecution made notes on the jury questionnaires which are also in the -- in the joint lodging. But the -- the other point I just want to make about the trial judge is the -- we know -- there's not a question about whether the trial judge's findings are unreasonable in light of the evidence. Finding number 6, the trial judge said there was no disparate examination of any venire member. Well, in this Court, the State has totally disavowed that. The State acknowledges that when jurors were questioned about their ability to impose the minimum punishment for the lesser included offense of murder, they used two different scripts. And when they talked about the means of execution, they used a graphic script that went on in detail to explain how somebody is executed in Texas, and a regular script that just said, how do you feel about the death penalty? Now, they --",
  "I think it does. The one that we're -- that -- that you have to focus most directly on is number 10 --",
  "-- which is the -- the finding, which is the ultimate finding. But my point is that there are a number of findings that this judge made that are at the very least suspect and one in which the State has completely walked away from. And I want -- I want to spend, if I can, just a few minutes talking about the jury shuffle and the disparate questioning because I've been a trial lawyer for many years, but never tried a case in this system, and it was sort of a little bit confusing to me. But with respect to the disparate questioning, each of the prospective jurors was questioned about whether they could impose the minimum punishment if they found that the offense was murder and not capital murder, and the minimum punishment being 5 years. And they were also asked about their views about capital punishment. Now, some of those people who were asked about their views about capital punishment were first treated to a graphic description of how that punishment occurs. And some of the people who were questioned about minimum punishment were told in advance the range is 5 years to 99 years. Could you do either? And many of them were just asked, what do you think the minimum penalty is that you would impose for willful, deliberate, intentional, cold- blooded murder where there was no robbery? And our submission in our principal brief and below was that the State used those disparities in a racially discriminatory manner and that bears tremendously on the intent of the prosecutor in executing the peremptory strikes. And their --",
  "Not at all. They don't have to ask the same questions. They don't have to ask them in the same way. All that we're saying is that when they do ask the same questions and they ask them in a way which is acknowledged to be different and they acknowledge that they --",
  "I think I -- I managed to confuse even myself.",
  "The prosecution -- I believe that Ms. Bunn will confirm. The prosecution said we had two different ways of questioning about these two subjects, and we used them deliberately at -- with different jurors and we did it in order to remove jurors that we thought were weak on the death penalty. That is the reason that they give and that's the reason against which their justification must be judged, and it is --",
  "Sure, if you -- I -- if you -- somebody says, look, I -- there's no way I can impose the death penalty, and -- as a -- as a prosecutor I don't want -- I don't know if I can use a for cause strike, I don't want to use a peremptory, let me see if I can't get them to say something that will allow the judge to knock them out for cause, that's entirely legitimate. The question is why did they do it. Because it would be illegitimate if they were doing it deliberately disproportionately against black jurors because they were black and it would be legitimate if they were saying, okay, you know, people who expressed hesitation about the death penalty -- we're going to do everything we can to try and get rid of these people for cause. And let's just look at the State's own statistics. This is their statistics from their brief at pages 17 and 18 and notes 38 and 39. With respect to minimum punishment, seven of the eight African American jurors who were questioned about minimum punishment were not told in advance that the minimum punishment was 5 years. And when they were asked what they thought minimum punishment was, they said 20 years, life. One person said that he thought the death penalty was the minimum -- minimum -- punishment. For the whites, 36 white jurors were questioned. Two -- only two were not told that it was 5 years in advance. Now, they say that's not fair because you only need to compare those jurors who had expressed hesitation about the death penalty because that was our factor. And they identify in their brief 10 white jurors and 10 black jurors who expressed hesitation. Well, two things. Okay, we'll use your numbers. That means that of the 10 black jurors who expressed hesitation, 7 were given this trick questioning and 2 --",
  "Under Texas -- Mr. Chief Justice, under Texas law, that is grounds for disqualification for cause and the prosecution did seek --",
  "The inability to impose the minimum punishment -- to consider the minimum punishment that the law allows. And they did try and strike two black jurors for inability to impose minimum punishment, however odd that seems given the role of the prosecution in a case. They say there were 10 of each and even taking -- 10 hesitant jurors, and even taking their numbers at -- at their word, that means, nonetheless, that a black hesitant juror was three-and-a-half times more likely than a white to be struck. And it doesn't account for the fact that their 10 white jurors wildly understates the number of white jurors who expressed hesitation about the death penalty. It doesn't even include a white juror that they struck for cause for inability to impose the death penalty, Mr. Sohner. And there are at least 8 or 9 other jurors that we identify in our papers that are not in their list of 10. So even if you take their universe at its will, blacks were three-and-a-half times more likely to be tricked by this minimum punishment ploy than whites. Now, on the graphic script about the death penalty, they said, you bet, there were some people that we went through all the gory details of how execution occurs because we were trying to get those people off the jury because they were hesitant about the death penalty, but we did it with hesitant white jurors and we did it with hesitant black jurors. Let's look at their numbers. Eight of the 15 African American jurors were given the graphic script, 53 percent. Three of the 49 white jurors were given the graphic script.",
  "Well, it might -- it might be, but if couldn't be on this record because there were only 15 black jurors. So out of the whole -- I'm using the entire universe of everyone who was questioned. Let's then go to their explanation. They say it only applied to jurors who expressed hesitation about the death penalty. Let's just look at that universe. There was 10 of -- there were 10 of each. Okay. That means that 7 of the 10 black jurors that they say expressed hesitation were given this graphic script, and of the 10 white jurors that say expressed hesitation, 2 were given this. And that to us is evidence of conduct that occurred during voir dire that admits of only a racial explanation just as their conduct of the jury shuffle, which is a ubiquitous and unique Texas practice that exists only in the State of Texas. And we go through in our brief -- perhaps in as not as much detail as -- as would be appropriate but, nonetheless, given the page limits -- and show that the State on at least three occasions used the -- its prerogative to shuffle the jury for the obvious purpose of moving African American jurors who were in the front of the venire where they would be questioned to the back of the venire each week where they would not. And here it's important to understand something about the procedure in this case. There was a different venire called every week. Jury selection extended over 5 weeks. Each week either 40 or 50 new venire members were brought into the courtroom, and they were seated in order. And as soon as they sat down, the record reflects, the judge asked the State first and then the defense whether they wanted to, quote, shuffle the jury.",
  "I will try to tell you and I would respectfully refer you, in case I fail, to the Texas Bar Journal article that we cited in our reply brief by a professor at, I think, the University of Houston which explains this practice. But in Texas, jurors of course are -- venires are required to be chosen randomly, but there has always been a practice -- and it's now codified by statute -- that allows the -- the lawyers in the case -- this is in civil and criminal cases -- to look at the venire as it's arrayed in order and based on what Judge Holcomb explained for the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, based on, quote, visual preference, because they haven't questioned these jurors at all, the State and then the defense can say we want to reshuffle the order. We don't like the order. And it is well understood in Texas that the principal reason for doing that is race and gender.",
  "What happens is you take the -- the juror cards and it's either done in the central jury room or in the courtroom, and they are shuffled either by the clerk shuffling the way you would shuffle a deck or, in this case, they were apparently, according to the record, put into a metal basket and the lawyer would sort of run his hands around and they'd pick them out, and they would then be in a new order. And after the State exercised its shuffle or declined to exercise its shuffle, the defense could choose whether to shuffle or not.",
  "No. They are reseated so that --",
  "Indeed. Indeed, and it can be done not once, but twice. And it's particularly critical here because what the judge --",
  "Here's the -- here's the consequence. The way the jury was picked here, they questioned -- they questioned between 15 and -- generally between 15 and 20. One week they got to 30 jurors because they were doing individual voir dire. And so if you were not in the first 15 out of the 50 or certainly in the first 30 out of the 50, you weren't going to be questioned at all. In fact, the judge told them at the outset, that if they were -- when the order was finally set, if they were in the last two rows, they could just go home that day and never come back. And so the consequence of shuffling in this case wasn't the consequence you'd have if you had 50 jurors picked -- this is a capital case. We're going to ask all of you -- all of you -- questions, and it's just not that consequential what order you're in. But here the order meant everything. If you could get -- if the -- if the prosecution could get the black jurors out of the first 15 or 20 and into the back, they wouldn't have to worry about the disparate questioning or exercising peremptory challenges. And the -- the record in this case I think -- it doesn't involve an admission but it is very, very strong evidence. I -- I just want to say, before sitting down for rebuttal, a point that may be obvious, but it is surpassingly important for this Court to decide the merits of the Batson challenge. There are many areas in the law in which -- in which this Court delineates the contours of constitutional doctrine by demonstrating what result a given set of facts yields. And so too Batson's abstract rules, its doctrines about the burden of proof and the quantum of proof, can also only be demonstrated and meaningfully elucidated by a model. This is the kind of area like voluntariness, ineffective assistance of counsel, First Amendment actual malice in which this Court can and, I submit, under (d)(2) must model a case for the State courts and the lower Federal courts to show what quantum of evidence is sufficient to require a conclusion that a trial court's acceptance of a prosecutor as Batson's avowed reasons are objectively unreasonable. And I'll please reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you. I just have six short rebuttal points to correct the record. The -- while the graphic script was given at the beginning of the voir dire and therefore based only on the questionnaires, the minimum punishment ploy -- that is, trying to trick jurors about minimum punishment -- was done at the very end, after they had all of the evidence. And therefore, the relevant universe of whites who expressed hesitation is not 10, as the State says, but 19. And in any event, even with 10, they are three-and-a-half times as likely. With -- also, we did -- the trial -- the defense lawyers in this case objected over and over and over again to trying to trick these black jurors by asking them what minimum punishment they would give without expressing the number. The voir dire is replete with this. With respect to the graphic script, which did come at the beginning, well, the State now says, well, we don't have the questionnaires for all the people, so we don't really know how many there were. We know that we used the graphic script with three of them. Okay. The three that they used that they identified are jurors 27, 59, and 68. Two were excused by agreement, and one, number 68, was seated. But we do know what the juror questionnaires were -- I'm just doing a -- sort of a quick list on the back of my note card here -- for Mr. Vickery, Ms. Mazza, Mr. Gutierrez, Mr. Hearn, and Mr. Duke. Mazza, who is -- who features prominently here and who is not included in their 10, said in her questionnaire, it depends on the crime.",
  "It is that --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We rely on four propositions in this case. First, there is a long final judgment in the Agent Orange litigation that binds a class which by its terms includes respondents. Second, all of the judges in the direct proceedings, the trial judges and the appellate judges, concluded that all veterans should be included in the class and settlement, because all of the veterans, whether they were symptomatic or not, face the overwhelming prospect of legal defeat on issues common to the entire class, first and foremost, the Government contractor defense. Third, adequacy of representation was expressly considered several times, both generally and with specific respect to asymptomatic veterans, by both the district court and the court of appeals, and fourth, there is simply no question that Judge Weinstein, whose scholarship on class actions the 1966 Rule 23 Advisory Committee repeatedly cited, and who literally wrote the book on mass tort litigation, conscientiously applied the procedures of Rule 23, including, in particular, the obligation that he certify and thereafter ensure adequacy of representation. Now, the respondents may certainly challenge the res judicata effect of the judgment against them, and the question presented for this Court is the permissible scope and standard of that review. In our view, due process does not require and finality principles do not permit de novo relitigation from scratch of the adequacy determination made in this case.",
  "Well, Justice O'Connor, notice in this case -- I think as the case comes to this Court, the Court certainly cannot decide this case on the principle that the notice was constitutionally inadequate. In the first place, both the trial court and the court of appeals three times found the notice adequate under Rule 23 and under the Due Process Clause. The Second Circuit below suggested that this Court's decision in Amchem might have made the notice defective, but notice issues were not presented by the respondents in this case as an alternative grounds for affirmance in their brief in opposition, and what is more, their factual record in this case is completely inadequate to conclude that the notice was unsatisfactory with respect to the content. I completely understand the argument that they're making with respect to how the words, injured by exposure, would have been read at the time, but one cannot answer that question either in a vacuum, without looking at the external circumstances, or in hindsight. One has to determine whether, in 1984, an asymptomatic veteran, a healthy veteran, would, whether all of them, many of them, most of them, some of them, or some significant number would have understood that that includes me because exposure itself has been said to be injurious. Now, at footnote 12 --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, before I answer that, let me just give one more answer to Justice O'Connor, and I'll directly address your question. The only other point I wanted to make -- I'm afraid I'll forget it -- is that in footnote 12 of our reply brief we point out that at the time, that is, at the time of certification and before settlement, publications ranging from The New York Times to Penthouse Magazine, which we put at the end of our footnote, and newspapers, local newspapers in the states that these two respondents reside in, understood that the class included all veterans in Vietnam who were -- were or may have been exposed, and that's the factual issue that, without which you can't resolve the notice issue in this case adverse to us. Now, Justice Ginsburg --",
  "Well --",
  "Well, first of all, Justice Ginsburg, as you pointed out, the Metro North case, a) long post dated the final judgment in this case, and --",
  "No, I do understand that, and it was looking to traditional common law in order to make a ruling with respect to the FELA. Now, at the time, in 19 -- I mean, our submission essentially is, here the adequacy determination and the Article III claims sort of mesh together, but our -- our submission here is that injury in fact, which is what is necessary in order to include them in the class, is not dependent on the existence of a mature cause of action. They clearly alleged that they were injured in fact because, as New York State and other states recognized at the time, there was a mature tort for exposure, injury by exposure, and many, many states recognized that and applied that rule at the time, and in any event, whether or not they had a mature cause of action, they plainly had a present right at the time and a cognizable interest in the establishment of a -- of a fund that would be available to compensate them. That's the word this Court --",
  "Well, there -- I believe there are at least two separate questions --",
  "-- and I'll deal with the respondents in this case first. They allege that they never saw any notice saying anything at any time, which makes -- and of course we know from Dusenbery, and before that Mullane, that actual notice isn't required, so the wording of the no -- these are peculiarly inappropriate parties to be complaining about the wording of one of the many notices that went out in this case. There were at least three, and perhaps four notices that went out, and the notice that they are putting their attention on is the notice certifying --",
  "Not at all. We think that there clearly are -- since actual notice isn't required, we don't think that they lack standing to, on behalf of the 2.4 million people who were in the class --",
  "-- to say that we have -- Mullane requires that the content of the notice be adequate as well as the --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, this point, and indeed most, if not all of the points that the respondents are making in this collateral litigation, were made by my clients in the direct proceedings before Judge Weinstein and in the mandamus petition that went up to the Second Circuit from his class certification decision. We argued that there should be individual notice to all veterans. The Government represented, the plaintiffs claimed, and both the trial court and the Second Circuit expressly found --",
  "-- that there was not such a list.",
  "Asymptomatic?",
  "The named representatives were not asymptomatic, and by design. Judge Weinstein wanted to put in front of the jury the strongest, most sympathetic cases for causation, and there -- at the time of settlement in this case, the symptomatic representatives were completely representative of the views of all veterans, because they had the following overwhelming objectives: defeat the Government contractor defense which, as it turns out, was applied both by the district court and by the court of appeals to grant judgment against the people who actually opted out and pursued their claims. Secondly, to establish a defense to the company's defense that the Government had misused it, that the Government had prevented them from putting warnings on, and to prove general causation, that is, to establish proof by a preponderance --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, the distinction here, even at the distribution phase -- and remember, the parties, the plaintiffs' representatives and the plaintiffs' lawyers, recognizing the extreme weakness of their legal claims, however great the pathos was, and genuine anguish that they suffered, that their legal claims were so weak they were willing to settle this case and, on the assumption that Judge Weinstein and the Special Master would allocate the formula, and the -- I would say the proof in the pudding is that the named representatives included six veterans. I believe only two of them were ever given cash benefits in this case, as opposed to the general benefits that the class received from the $70 million class --",
  "They were all --",
  "-- they were all symptomatic, and our submission here is that, as Judge Weinstein found and the Second Circuit found, in response to precisely these arguments, the pervasive, overwhelming, common weakness that all of the plaintiffs had with respect to the legal issues made the representation of asymptomatic veterans representative. This is --",
  "Justice Souter, I -- I do at some point want to argue to the Court why we think that de novo relitigation of adequacy is not appropriate on collateral review, but even if it were, I believe I have a satisfactory answer to your question. First of all, the way that the distribution, the allocation proceedings occurred, with hearings, multiple hearings, multiple submissions not only by the class representatives whose proposal was uniquely rejected by Judge Weinstein, but by individual veterans, veterans groups, actuaries, scientists --",
  "That, to be sure. To be sure, but they were -- the class -- first of all, and Shutts itself stands for the proposition, Phillips Petroleum v. Shutts stands for the proposition that the court and the parties adverse to the class may supply the arguments and the necessary sharpness in an adversary system to assure that in the main the procedures followed were sufficiently fundamentally fair, but here I think it's very important not to character -- not to understand that in 1984 this looked like the type of futures versus presents that existed in Amchem and existed in Ortiz. First --",
  "Okay, for several reasons. First of all, the -- this -- in those cases you had a situation in which people who presently suffered from asbestosis and mesothelioma and the other -- the other tragic manifestations of asbestos exposure had valuable, demonstrably valuable -- there was a matrix to figure out how much they were entitled to, and the rest of the class, which, unlike here, included -- in the asbestos context included -- the entire civilized world who may or may not have been exposed to asbestos, had claims worth nothing. In this case the district court and the Second Circuit found repeatedly that what united these people was, none of them had a legal claim that was worth anything under the way the law existed at the time, and we think exists now. Secondly, the distinction between futures and presents was one of many, many, many different ways that you could distinguish among the class. The more salient one, we think, was between people who would recover anything under the settlement and people who would recover nothing under the settlement. For example --",
  "I think that there -- there -- Judge Weinstein recognized, and several people who appeared before him and provided testimony, written and oral testimony in the fairness hearings, in the distribution hearings, in the motion for reconsideration, and written objections, and a motion to certify a class, made him very aware that, and he himself was aware from reading the literature, that the latency period for many diseases is as long as 40 years, and there would be claims that would come up long into the future that some people would attribute to exposure to Agent Orange, and what he did was, he said, I will --",
  "Well, what Judge Weinstein found, and what -- the Second Circuit on appeal insisted that the settlement fund be entirely disposed of within the period. What Judge Weinstein found was, we have to make provision for all veterans who were exposed. I'm going to do it in two ways, given the size of the class and the indeterminacy of the law. Number 1, I'm going to set aside a certain pot of this money to provide cash benefits. It will be insufficient. It will be insufficient as a matter of insurance, although more than sufficient as a matter of proximate causation, since nobody can demonstrate that. I'm then going to take what turned out to be $70 million and use it for the benefit of the class as a whole, for educational programs, for counseling programs, for health programs, for the very kinds of programs that produced the enactment of the Agent Orange legislation that now provides, on a monthly basis, more money than almost any veteran got, period, and also funded the medical studies and scientific studies, or prompted enactment of legislation that funded the studies that now allow them to claim that there are -- that there is greater evidence of an association.",
  "As to the other -- as to the -- pardon me.",
  "Yes, I could. May I say one sentence in response to Justice O'Connor --",
  "-- and I will. With respect to the 75 percent of the fund that went for compensation, Judge Weinstein understood and did reserve a very substantial portion of that for people who manifested in the future, and the respondents in the case were just like the respondents in Ivy/Hartman, which is, they were asymptomatic. They didn't know whether they were going to become ill and, if so, when, and what Judge -- and many - - thousands of claims were paid of people who manifested disease in the future, and what Judge Weinstein said is, look, at some point, the time passage is so great that it simply becomes almost impossible, as a matter of causation, to be able -- we all get sick, and unfortunately we all die, and many of us get diseases, and as time passes, he ruled, it becomes less and less likely you could ever prove causation, and that's why he drew the line that he did. Mr. Chief Justice, our proposition with respect to the standard of review is threefold. First of all, it should not be de novo redetermination of adequacy. Second, because there was no showing of collusion or fraud, which are recognized exceptions to the res judicata effect of a judgment, and because the courts conscientiously applied procedures that Congress adopted specifically in response to Hansberry in order to provide procedures that in the main will provide fundamental fairness in all but the most extraordinary cases, that should be the end of the inquiry. That is the question on collateral review. And third, even if that is not true, and even if a court should take note of the substantive claim of inadequacy of representation, the prior determination should be subject to a highly deferential standard that is appropriate for a collateral attack on a 20-year-old judgment in which pervasive --",
  "-- finality and reliance interests --",
  "Well, the --",
  "Well --",
  "Justice Breyer, first of all the Second Circuit did not do that. Notably it didn't do it. It didn't do it in a case in which there are 60 reported decisions, something like 13,000 docket entries in the district court alone. What it said is, we're going to retroactively apply Amchem. We're going to conclude that Amchem was a due process decision, even though it explicitly disavowed that, and --",
  "Our submission that you --",
  "Certainly not.",
  "Certainly not.",
  "I'm just pointing out that Amchem didn't redetermine adequacy as a factual matter. It concluded that as a matter of law --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, with respect, we cited in our brief district court decisions in the 1980's that were --",
  "And --",
  "Both the Second Circuit in this case and the Ninth Circuit in the Epstein case on which we rely characterized Amchem as heralding a new era, or being a watershed decision, and our submission only is that for purposes of the new rules, doctrine that this Court announced, for example, in Teague v. Lane and following cases, the burden is on the party that seeks to invoke the benefit of a later-decided case to prove that a conscientious court prior to the announcement of the rule would have been, quote, compelled to conclude that futures could not be included in the class. Now, as to the standard of review, this Court's decision -- this Court even in Teague itself, which was a criminal case, the Court said, to be sure, in civil cases finality concerns are far, far more important, and in cases like Brecht and Herrera, this Court has emphasized over and over again, even when a defendant's life is at stake, that on collateral review, in a subsequent review of a final judgment, the showing has to be, quote, necessarily far higher to obtain relief than on direct review. This Court's decisions in the -- in jurisdiction cases, subject matter and personal jurisdiction cases, where we're talking about the fundament of the power of the original court to decide the case prove that, if there -- in Stohl v. Gotlieb, this Court pointed out that with respect to the first proceeding, even without any express discussion of it, we have to assume, and we will conclusively presume that the original court had subject matter jurisdiction unless it would have been a, quote, manifest abuse of authority to have done so, and with respect to personal jurisdiction, Durfee v. Duke and Iowa v. Baldwin and those other cases all stand for the proposition that if the prior court, quote, has decided the question of jurisdiction over the parties as a contested issue there will be no reinquiry into personal jurisdiction. We're not even advocating that rule in our second test. We're just saying, it should be deferential.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, this is a representative suit. There is a judgment that says, at this point, with respect, there is a judgment that said, these parties were there. Now, the analogy I think that would be appropriate here would be with reference to the -- the default judgment cases, where you can say, you can't have a default judgment on jurisdiction because no one appeared to contest it. That can't happen in a representative suit. As we pointed out in our blue brief, the judge cannot grant a default judgment in a class action. He has to --",
  "He has to make the determination that the representation was adequate, and it was made repeatedly and affirmed repeatedly in this case. May I reserve the balance of my time?",
  "Justice O'Connor, the -- the Isaacson case can't just be remanded, because we assert jurisdiction under 1442. Justice Breyer, it is not the case -- adequacy in general, and specifically with respect to futures was specifically raised and determined before the judgment became final as well as in Ivy/Hartman. The Second Circuit's decision at 818 F.2d 167 says, quote, appellants argue that the diverse interests of the class make adequate representation virtually impossible. We disagree. They were responding to a brief that particularly brought the precise issue to their attention, and --",
  "I -- we think that you should reverse the judgment --",
  "He is indeed bound --",
  "-- by the final judgment of this case both because he was adequately represented, and a determination after a full consideration was made. He was -- our submission is that there's no argument that -- that procedures that were enacted to protect due process in the vast majority of cases were followed, and therefore he's bound under Walters and those other, that due process line, and in any event, if you take a look at adequacy you should, a) give tremendous deference, and because the issue has been decided, because the consequences of not giving deference would be unbelievably unsettling. These adequacy determinations are not easy, and res judicata doesn't exist for the easy cases. The consequence of hundreds, if not thousands of other cases -- thank you, Your Honor. I see my time has expired.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The complaint in this case alleges that a national bank charged excessive interest. This Court has held repeatedly and consistently since 1875 that section 30 of the National Bank Act of 1864 provides both the exclusive standards governing the interest that a national bank may charge and the exclusive judicial remedies for any violation. And as a result, any claim that a national bank charged excessive interest necessarily arises under Federal law, whether that claim is brought in State court or Federal court. Any well-pleaded complaint would reflect that, and therefore, any claim of usury against a national bank, whether pleaded well or mistakenly or deceptively, falls within the original jurisdiction of the Federal courts and may either be filed there by a plaintiff or removed there by a defendant.",
  "Justice Scalia, with respect, I don't think that I would concede the premise of your question, that is, that a Federal cause of action ordinarily has an additional element.",
  "But leaving that aside --",
  "Your -- your hypothetical actually is an example of a very peculiar instance in which, with respect to nuclear incidents, Congress has imported in -- has federalized the cause. It created an express Federal cause of action --",
  "-- and said expressly that State law standards will apply and it will be the law of whatever State the incident occurred.",
  "If -- if --",
  "If -- if any -- I hope I can remember your hypothetical. The --",
  "It is definitely removable. It definitely is completely preempted if it comes within the scope of a cause of action that has been determined to be exclusive. Now, that's --",
  "Justice Scalia, there may -- in preemption cases, there are line-drawing problems at the margins about whether something is or isn't preempted. This is a heartland case and the example -- the hypothetical you're giving is let's say that State of Alabama or the State of Delaware created strict liability for excessive interest. The Federal statute says it has to be knowingly under section 86. There is no question -- no question -- under this Court's decided cases that a claim that a national bank charged excessive interest, with whatever state of mind or lack of state of mind, is governed exclusively by Federal standards and an exclusive Federal cause of action and that --",
  "Well, the --",
  "The -- the pleading -- the complaint in this case on its face does satisfy the Federal cause of action and --",
  "I think --",
  "It has to be one that if well pleaded -- I mean, a -- on a removal -- on a notice of removal, the Federal court is obligated, like any court determining its own jurisdiction, to read the complaint as if it were well pleaded. And if, when the court reads the complaint, it says there is a Federal question necessarily presented in here which has been inartfully not pleaded, the court then proceeds to adjudicate on the merits that claim. If the answer is no, if the answer is, hey, this guy pleaded a claim under State law and I have well pleaded it and it still doesn't raise a Federal question, then you remand. And it's that -- that's sort of -- I didn't mean to quibble with you, but the principle that we suggest is very straightforward is simply an application of this Court's decided jurisprudence, under arising-under jurisdiction, that removal jurisdiction follows original jurisdiction.",
  "Yes.",
  "Indeed. And the -- the perplexing thing about this case is the sort of almost Kafkaesque situation that we have that's exemplified by the amicus briefs on both sides where this particular instance where the plaintiff says usury under State law even though the Supreme -- this -- this Court has decided, since 11 years after the act was passed in the Civil War, that there is no such State claim, we now have a -- a group of plaintiffs' lawyers from California urging this Court to establish a right to plead something that in their own case they say is only, quote, defensively preempted.",
  "And no one has -- I'm sorry.",
  "Correct. There is concurrent jurisdiction as there -- as is the norm, as this Court has explained. And there are instances in which these cases are litigated to the merits in State court and instances in which they're litigated in Federal court either because they're brought there by the plaintiff, as the plaintiff could have here, or they're removed there as the defendant. And the other principle that this case reflects, as I said, is not just the importance of parity in Federal question jurisdiction between giving plaintiffs and defendants parity in invoking the Federal courts if they choose, but the requirement that this Court has stated over and over and over again that in -- in determining its own jurisdiction, the Federal court will construe the complaint as well-pleaded.",
  "No. Justice Scalia, I think it actually is very, very narrow. And we can go through in detail, but almost all of the statutory schemes that the -- the State's amicus brief cites are not, in fact, examples of complete preemption. But it -- it comes up only in the instance where there is not only substantive preemption by Federal law and the creation of a Federal cause of action, but the determination that that cause of action is, in fact, exclusive. And that is the difficult and close question that this Court --",
  "No, it wasn't a removal case. And in fact, depending on when in 1875 it was decided, there may or may not have been --",
  "-- there may not have been removal.",
  "I think it is a -- if I understand the reference, I think it is a white horse case in the sense -- in this sense, Mr. Chief Justice. We're not contending that the 1864 act evinced an intent to make these causes of action removable, even if pleaded under State law, because there was no general Federal question jurisdiction, and it wasn't provided in the law. The relevant question and the relevant question that this Court deemed to be close in Metropolitan Life in the ERISA context is whether -- okay, fine, Federal law has substantively preempted the field or by conflict or whatever. Is the creation of the Federal cause of action of such force that it should be deemed to be exclusive? And that, I think, is what this Court decided first in Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank by saying to the borrower in that case -- the borrower was maintaining that under New York State law, it was entitled to void not -- to forfeit not just the interest, but the note. And this Court said, look, New York State law has nothing to do with this. This is a claim of usury by a national bank. The Federal standards are exclusive, and the Federal penalty expressly will not permit forfeiture of the note. Only the interest.",
  "Not at all. And in fact, it was expressly contemplated. Then as now, these actions can be brought and are often brought in State courts. All that the --",
  "That -- that's correct, Justice Ginsburg. And the same is true for the types of ERISA claims that were at issue in Metropolitan Life.",
  "Correct. For example, the Copyright Act.",
  "The Copyright Act certainly is an example of complete preemption, but there's a statutory provision that --",
  "Here's -- here's why, Justice Scalia. The very difficult -- this Court made clear in Metropolitan Life, if it wasn't clear before, that it wasn't going to infer from congressional silence very lightly that when Congress created a Federal cause of action, it meant it to be exclusive so that it would displace State causes of action. There's a very strong and longstanding presumption to the contrary. But that difficult question was decided in the context of section 30 of the National Bank Act beginning in 1875 for reasons that are explained in this Court's opinion and in the Comptroller's report that the Government cites that precipitated the enactment of section 30, which is that this was war legislation. This was a -- the creation of the national banks was hoped by Congress and President Lincoln that it would provide the means with which the Government could continue to fund the war, and national banks would knit the country together when the war was finished. And the one thing that comes out of the history of this case and is reflected in this Court's opinions is that they feared, based on their experience with the first bank of the United States and the second bank of the United States, that jealous States, States that were jealous of their State-chartered banks, which were issuing paper at the time, would engage in predations against the national banks that were created at the very same time that section 30 was enacted and, in essence, smother this important Federal infant in its crib.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Yes. There has to be substantive -- Congress has to supply the exclusive substantive standards. It has to create a cause of action to remedy violations of those standards, and this is the hard part. And it also has to make clear that that -- that judicial remedy is, in fact, exclusive, that is, that it will not permit the existence or operation of State law causes of action, even those that import the Federal standards and my --",
  "You -- you have to find out what Congress had in mind, but I think this Court has made clear in Metropolitan Life that it is going to be the rare, rare, rare day when the Federal courts will infer from congressional silence that a Federal cause of action is to be exclusive. And the other examples in -- in which -- in the Federal law in which there is, in fact, complete preemption, the FELA or the Carmack Amendment as an example, Congress has gone ahead and expressly made those actions nonremovable. May I reserve the balance of my time?",
  "Justice Scalia, the answer to your question is yes, if there are --",
  "Your question was if -- if you -- you said this would take time, and it will. You pleaded all the elements of a Federal cause of action, but it also -- it also satisfies a State cause of action. If the Federal cause of action is not exclusive except in that rare instance, it is not removable. Justice Breyer, yes, indeed we say that you stop at point 3. That is, you determine whether or not this is the rare instance in which there's not only substantive preemption but exclusive Federal remedies. And the reason you stop is because we have Federal question jurisdiction. It says that removal is tied to original jurisdiction, and therefore, the question is, does the complaint well-pleaded necessarily state a cause of action? Justice Holmes indicated in a statement that is oft repeated and, if it's anything, is under-inclusive, as this Court indicated I think in Merrell Dow, that a suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action. If the cause of action is exclusively Federal, in that rare instance, it's under arising-under jurisdiction. Justice Kennedy I think asked what for me is the most difficult question in this Court's sometimes not fully explicated arising-under jurisdiction, which is the question that was addressed in Merrell Dow and in particular in footnote 1 in this Court's opinion in Merrell Dow, which is if you have a State cause of action misrepresentation, but it has embedded with it as a necessary matter a conclusion about whether Federal law was or was not satisfied, does that State claim arise under Federal jurisdiction? In Franchise Tax Board, this Court repeated dicta that suggests that the answer is yes. And in Smith versus Kansas City Title and Trust, this -- this Court seemed to indicate yes. But in Moore versus Chesapeake -- the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, the Court suggested that the embedded Federal question has to be central to the State cause of action and really important. And the result, as I -- as I think things stand now, is we have a very long footnote 1 in this Court's opinion in Merrell Dow that says many people have difficulty resolving our jurisprudence in this area, but in the Merrell Dow context, where there was a State tort claim that could -- may I finish my --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issues before the Court in connection with Title I and the rest of this legislation raise the most fundamental challenge for any, for any representative democracy. It's a challenge that this Court, beginning at least with Justice Frankfurter and the United Auto Workers case and extending through this Court's opinion in Shrink Missouri and Beaumont, has recognized that is the imperative of a representative democracy to retain the confidence of the individual citizens with whom we all share the franchise, that their vote counts, that big money doesn't call the tune, and that when Members of Congress and the President and Vice President make decisions on our behalf, they do so because they think it is in the best interest of their country and our judgment as constituents and their own judgment. And there was reference paid, reference made to the testimony of members of this, of Congress, respected members like Senator Simpson and Senator Rudman, and it is very important to focus on what those Senators said under oath. When Senator Simpson testified, he testified that too often, members' first thought is not what is right, or what they will believe, but how it will affect fundraising. Who, after all, can seriously contend that a $100,000 donation does not seriously alter the way one thinks about and quite possibly votes on an issue?",
  "He was -- his declaration is, his sworn declaration is in the joint appendix, Mr. Chief Justice, in the first volume. He was speaking in general and about all of us, and so, too, was Senator Rudman when he testified under oath that large soft money contributions distort the legislative process because they affect whom Senators and House members see, whom they spend their time with, what input they get, and make no mistake about it, this money affects outcomes as well, and millions --",
  "There was, there was a concession in this case that give, that there is no specific evidence that a particular vote was changed because of a particular donation, but of course, that, too, was not true in Buckley v. Valeo. Buckley v. Valeo, this Court made reference to the findings of the D.C. Circuit which dealt exclusively with excess access by the milk producers and others and ambassadorships and the record in this case so overwhelms the record before this Court in -- in fact, it overwhelms by several orders of magnitude the factual records that existed in Buckley and all of its progeny. Now, Justice --",
  "It certainly doesn't mean they're going to vote that way, but --",
  "The testimony --",
  "The giving -- this Court has said that corruption in the Buckley sense is the influence of large donations on the judgment and behavior of officeholders, and Justice Scalia, there is a mountain of evidence from experts, members, lobbyists, 60 pages of findings from Judge Kollar-Kotelly and almost as many from Judge Leon that access buys influence, and there are any number of ways that cannot be statistically observed to change outcomes besides a particular vote.",
  "You can go back and overrule Buckley v. Valeo, and every other one of these cases you have decided because that has never been proven. It is very difficult to prove, and what Cong -- what Congress needs to aim at, it needs to aim at the willingness of the hundreds of millions of people out there who think that their vote counts and think that Members of Congress will be responsive to them and who are justifiably cynical when they see that in the last presidential election, $500 million that law does not permit to be used for Federal election purposes was used for that purpose as the political party's own expert, Professor La Raja acknowledged that it almost all was used for Federal election purposes. This goes right to the question, it goes right to Justice O'Connor's question about state parties and I think the Chief Justice's question about the national ban, and I'd like to address those first.",
  "Yes. I have, I have several questions and that, that was my, the next point I was going to address after the first two, which is, it is wrong on about 10 different levels, but the bottom line is if it turns out to be an abuse, that is, if it turns out to be a phenomenon that creates corruption as this Court defined it, either in the case of individual contributions in Buckley or through corporate and labor union for the principles that were articulated by this Court in National Right to Work and Austin and about which we'll be visiting this afternoon, Congress can take care of the problem. The one thing that --",
  "The one thing --",
  "The one thing that we know for certain, Justice Scalia, in this uncertain world, there is at least one thing that is certain, and that is that the people who enacted BCRA and the people who populate the House and Senate, if they find that the national political parties are being disadvantaged or losing their central role, not only in our political system, but in our system of governance, they will be there to address it. General Olson --",
  "To be sure, Justice Kennedy, and if it were impaired, Congress could and would address it. The data already shows that this year the parties have raised more in hard money alone than they raised in the last presidential election in hard and soft money, and they are right on a trajectory to raise $1.5 billion in hard money for all of their activities.",
  "Well, it, my argument doesn't depend on if the, the parties, of course, aren't mentioned in the Constitution, but they are a fundamental aspect of our system of representative government, and I, I meant to cast no aspersions on the fact that they play a role not only in electing candidates, but also in organizing in particular the legislative process and the conduct of legislative business. My only point is that we can be certain that if something comes to pass that our experience so far shows is not going to come to pass, Congress can come to their aid or someone can come to this Court, but the fact --",
  "There is, there is no question that the, that telling the national committees of the, the national committees of the national parties that you are now required to accept only funds that are subject to the limitations, restrictions, and reporting requirements of the Federal election, Federal law is a limitation and it requires them to accommodate it. I'm only saying that you cannot strike this law down on its face based on a Chicken Little prediction that something that by all accounts is not happening at all does happen. And the notion that corporate and union money is just going to flow from, these corporations that gave a million dollars to each party at the same time, is going to flow to the National Rifle Association or the National Abortion Rights League, I think mistakes the important laudable role that the parties play, and mistakes the fact that the evidence in this case is that those contributions were strong-armed. You look at the testimony in the record and the amicus brief of the business officials, these people were not dying to spend millions of dollars to both political parties, in order to support democracy. And the notion that they are going to go running to the National Rifle Association or to NARAL, I think has no basis in the record.",
  "I'm not sure that that's true, but however they choose to use their shareholders' resources, I think is up to the democracy of shareholders.",
  "I have been told that there are ways to read this court's opinion in Colorado Republican I and II, to limit that distinction. That is, the concept of an independent expenditure to the one which the Court was presented, which is a circumstance in which the party, in that case the Colorado Republican Party, didn't have a nominee. And therefore, it was rather difficult for it to be coordinating. But I believe that --",
  "That is correct. And this does go to the point that the Chief raised and Justice O'Connor raised about 323(a) and 323(b) that I hope I will be able to address. On the state parties, you've heard the quote from Mr. Burchfield. He was simply stating the obvious which is, we are talking here, as the act defines it, about national parties that organize themselves in national committees, state committees and local committees. And all of those parties, all of those committees act together to elect their slate of candidates. And it is my friends on the other side of this case and not us that demean the role of the state and local committees by essentially attaching their activities to races for dogcatcher and state assemblymen, when in fact, they play the central role in our system in identifying, grooming and supporting candidates for Federal office. The candidate on the Ohio ballot for Republican for Senate is nominated and placed there by the Ohio Republican Party. And you asked about the Tamraz or Riatti contributions and what evidence there was about it. The evidence is that if 323(b) were not in place, that is, there were just a national -- the national committees are out of the soft money business, most of the poster children in the Thompson committee report, Mr. Riatti in '92, Mr. Tamraz, Carl Lindner, the Hudson Indian gaming casinos. All of the greatest hits that Senator Thompson came up with. Those were people that gave money to the state and local parties in exchange for benefits that they perceived from Federal officeholders.",
  "Yes, to be sure. And my point, Mr. Chief Justice, is that to understand why Mr. Burchfield was correct in saying that this problem, this massive loophole had to address the state and local committees, you need to -- it simply reflects the reality that those committees, at least before they became under the big soft money regime, what one expert called offshore banks of the national committees, they play a very important role in selecting who are going to be the Federal candidates.",
  "As to the former, we don't think that the contribution, the soft money contribution ban is subject to strict scrutiny, and therefore, the fact that there may be some other way to sort of carve out money that's given to the national committee purely for state elections is a constitutional deficiency. But the argument -- the complicated point that Mr. Burchfield was making about how the Levin Amendment works was simply mistaken. It was mistaken in several respects. First of all, there is no prohibition -- first of all, the Levin Amendment is an option. If each state and local committee doesn't want to have it, they don't have to use it. And if they do use it, nothing prevents them from spending it together. They just can't transfer money, this soft Levin money, from one committee to another to essentially recreate the problem that existed before, which is phenomenal amounts of soft money all being transferred to a few battleground elections. This is important. A national committee official may -- and the FEC has confirmed this repeatedly -- may in his official capacity, under the stationery of the national committee, solicit funds up to the hard money limits for any state and local candidate or any state and local committee. That is, it is simply false that a member of the Republican National Committee cannot raise $25 to support Haley Barbour's candidacy. They can. And they can do it in their official capacity up to the hard money limits into an account that Haley Barbour -- a Federal account that Haley Barbour has set up and would need to set up in any event under 323(f) and 323(b).",
  "This is -- yes. This is hard money. And in fact, the national committees, even for a local committee that's chosen to use the Levin soft money, the law permits the national committees to send hard money to that local committee, provided it is not the money that creates the specific match for the allocation. And the notion that -- a wedge is driven in the midst that sort of creates a rift in this integrated national organization is simply wrong.",
  "No, the homegrown -- the so-called homegrown requirement -- I realize the Levin Amendment provisions are technical. There is a reason that you are not allowed to do that, and that goes again to the point --",
  "That's not homegrown. And it goes to the point about why there couldn't be or perhaps why didn't Congress just say let's create a separate account for the national committees, which is that the people who gave these huge contributions, the corporations and unions, did not care where it went. They cared what it bought them. And the notion that if a member of the national -- if Terry McAuliffe comes to somebody and says, we really need $6 million, it's just going to be used for state and local elections, but we really need it, that just recreates the problem that Congress was trying to address. Now, I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, that in the course of that rambling discourse, I answered your question about the national ban. But if I didn't, I would love to address myself to it. You asked, Justice Scalia, at the outset, is every problem soluble. And the answer -- I hope that was a rhetorical question. In any event, this problem --",
  "I believe it is, but out of respect for the Court and in an effort to be responsive, I won't treat it as such. No problem is solvable and as this Court's jurisprudence shows in this area, no solution is permanently solvable. We have a dialectic going on here between people who want to use money to influence people in government, and the institutions that need to preserve a sense of integrity and faith in the process. And what my colleagues on the other side are urging here -- there has been a lot of debate about the sort of capillaries of the system, but very little talk about the core of it. What they are urging is that this law be struck down on its face. And that is a counsel of despair, and that is an approach that this Court and this Congress and this people cannot countenance. Thank you very much.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Buckley v. Valeo taught not that the so-called magic words test was a constitutional immutable. It taught two lessons that are much more enduring, that are profound, and that demonstrate just exactly why the electioneering communications definition and provision is constitutional. The first thing that Buckley taught in this area is that statutory requirements that cut right through core political speech, nothing more core than vote for Bush or Bush is a good guy the day before the election. Statutory requirements in this area must be clear, they must be illusive so that they will not, as this Court said, quote, dissolve impractical application. No doubt about this case. No one on the other side has suggested that there is any lack of clarity in this objective test. The second test, the second factor that this Court articulated in --",
  "I'm sorry, the four-part primary definition, that is, it has to be at 60 days before, targeted at the electorate, a specifically identified candidate in an ad that is broadcast as opposed to an ad that runs in a newspaper.",
  "Well, the FEC took comments on whether or not it covered, for example, the McCain-Feingold regulation or Roth IRA. And it has ruled. It considered whether or not an ad that is run within the period but says call your Congressman and has the Congressman's name without identifying him by name is covered, and it ruled that it did. Now, those applications -- one of those applications, that is, the call your Congressman, my clients, the sponsor of this bill, urged the Court to the urge the FEC to adopt. It didn't because it found that there were possibilities for circumvention and not an established record to demonstrate that it would cause a problem in any number of cases.",
  "The second test, the lesson that Buckley teaches that is enduring is that standards in this area must be, quote, directed precisely to that spending that is unambiguously related to the campaign of a particular Federal candidate. And so many we are talking about whether or not this law is overbroad or substantially overbroad, I suggest that the Court look to the standard that it articulated itself in Buckley, which is are these expenditures for communications that are unambiguously campaign related. And if the answer is yes, in the vast majority of cases, then on its face, the statute deserves to stand. There may be particular applications that may be in fact unconstitutional. The FEC can issue rules, as-applied challenges --",
  "The district court struck down the primary definition and upheld an altered version of the backup definition, Mr. Chief Justice. And it did so, based on its understanding and it was a misunderstanding of what the data showed with respect to the answer that was given to, I think it's question 6 in the Buying Time study. That is, our data that showed that for one of the two years involved, 14.7 percent of the ads, which constituted a total of six ads, were issue-related, not candidate-related.",
  "No, Mr. Chief Justice. In fact, Judge Leon, who was the swing vote, so to speak, specifically found that although there had been some criticisms with respect to the methodology with respect to this one question, he specifically found that the Buying Time study was credible, and that the results should be given credence. And it was on the basis of his interpretation of the answer to that one question that he determined that, well, this is 14.7 percent or 17 percent and that's overbroad. And what I would like to address myself to is why -- first of all, that analysis was incorrect. But more to the point, even if there never had been a Buying Time study, even if this question was never asked, Congress had more than ample justification for doing this. One of the wonderful things about a bright line objective test is it invites hypotheticals. But what Congress had before it, which is in strict scrutiny, after all, what we're addressing ourselves to, was the real world. And it had before it -- this is Defense Exhibit 48 in the record below -- the story boards of all of the ads that were captured by the CMAG database. That is, in the 75 largest media markets in the 11 months that led up to the 1998 campaign and the 2000 campaign. And we urge the Court to look through this volume because the real world of what these ads were does not reflect the hypothetical instances in which a corporation or a labor union is faced with an imminent piece of legislation that's going to be enacted the week before or the week after an election and it's only about changing votes. There may very well be instances, if that occurs, in which an as-applied challenge can be made and a court can determine whether or not the law can constitutionally be applied to that. But what is an amazing feature about this case is the remarkable degree to which the four-part objective test that Congress drew actually hits the observed reality of what Congress knew these ads were about. At page 11A of the appendix to our brief, we've reprinted a chart that is also contained in Judge Kollar-Kotelly's findings at special appendix page 848. And what the chart shows is a graph that shows, over the course of, I believe it's 2000. This was 2000. Yes. Weeks prior to the 2000 election. If you look at the dotted line which sort of waves back and forth very close to the bottom axis, those are the number of ads, issue ads, run during 2000 that don't mention candidates. It stays very constant throughout the year. If you look at the hard line, you'll see an enormous spike that comes right about week 9, nine weeks before. That's 63 days before the election. And what Congress found was that there was substantial evidence, both the ads themselves and through objective data that I'm now going to describe, that what common sense leads you to believe, that is, that ads that run just before an election, that mention a candidate that are targeted at that candidate's election, and that use broadcast media, that is the most expensive kind of media possible, are very likely intended to have, and overwhelmingly likely will have, an effect on an election. Now, Justice Scalia, you're quite right. You know, the hip bone is connected to the thigh bone which is connected to the knee bone, and that doesn't mean you can regulate the metatarsals. But we're talking about a -- what a terrible metaphor. We're talking about a test here that -- we're talking the test is spending that is unambiguously related to a campaign. And what Congress found, based on the ads, is that that was the case. And if you don't want to read through all of these direct ads, just look at the ones that the Plaintiffs have attached to their brief.",
  "Absolutely not. And that is not the reason that -- there is a lot of talk about attack ads. But the reality is they didn't ban attack ads and they didn't even ban attack ads by corporations and labor unions and nonprofits.",
  "That's correct. There were individual statements by members of Congress who were upset about this. But if you look at the test that Congress crafted, and the fact -- and it is in the record in this case that the vast majority of these ads were attacking not incumbents. The vast majority of these ads were attacking challengers. I don't think it's fair --",
  "There is no doubt about the fact that these ads -- there are ads here that both attack and praise.",
  "My point to Justice Kennedy was, by and large, the incumbents made out very well under the status quo ante. And it is -- Justice Scalia --",
  "The purpose of the legislation, and it is manifest, we included it in an appendix in our brief, and it's in the Thompson committee report and the page is cited by Senator Thompson's amicus brief, is that Congress was closing a loophole. It was closing a loophole that the political director of the National Rifle Association called a line in the land drawn on a windy day. She said that the express advocacy test was a wall built of the same sturdy material as the emperor's clothing. Everyone sees it. No one believes it. It was, in other words, serving the paramount interest in reducing a provision of law, a provision of law enacted by Congress following this Court's decision in Buckley that had made the law an object of scorn. And that is all over the record in this case. That what this was about was replacing a line in the sand drawn on a windy day with a line that everybody can see and that no one would miss. And the evidence before Congress was not just this question 6, but the ads themselves, the way they ran. There are statement after statement after statement from witnesses in this case that are included in the Joint Appendix. And objective studies from -- the objective data from the Buying Time studies, the Annenberg Center, Professor Magleby at Brigham Young University. And the internal documents -- and we have some of these discussed in our brief -- the internal documents of the corporations and unions that ran these ads. They have documents that showed that they were aiming at voters, they were using consultants and pollsters to try and figure out how to get voters. They tested these against voters. These were electioneering in every sense of the word. And here is -- just to put some reality, I guess, the real world example behind that chart, number 11A. Citizens for Better Medicare was an organization that ran a large number of these ads in 2000. Described itself as -- its official Web site as a group of concerned seniors and companies and associations concerned about Medicare. It was in fact funded almost exclusively by Pharma and the corporations that make up Pharma. Nothing wrong with them running issue ads at all, Justice Scalia. From January 1 until September 4, that is, until the 60-day period cut in, they ran 23,867 issue ads about Medicare and not a single one mentioned a candidate. On September 4, until election day, they ran 10,876 ads all mentioning candidates. And on election day, they stopped cold. And in our brief, we discuss this at page 50 and 52. That is a particularly striking example of no requirement to disclose to the public who's paying for this when it is, in fact, corporate treasuries.",
  "Well, again, Justice -- Scalia",
  "Well, I -- Justice Scalia, I'm right here with my brother, Clement, with Austin. And with the very same rationale that this Court adopted in Austin, which was explicated in the Auto Workers case by Justice Frankfurter, which was recited again by a unanimous opinion of the Court in National Right to Work Committee. The issue here is whether or not, when we're talking about campaign-related speech, when we are talking about who gets to speak when individual citizens are exercising their constitutional franchise to vote, the question is whether corporations and labor unions have to do it the same way all the rest of us do.",
  "With voluntary funds contributed by individuals for that very purpose. And the PAC issue that has been discussed -- you probably have heard more than you want to hear about this law in any event, and certainly about the PACs. But the PAC issue that I want to address and the media exemption. On PACs, we've heard about that the labor unions and how hard it is for the AFL-CIO and what evidence there is in the record. Okay, in the 2000 election cycle, labor unions contributed $53 million from their PACs in contributions and expenditures. And that's not including the treasury funds that they use to run the kind of electioneering ads that are included in our submission. I guess the other two organizations that were named were the National Rifle Association and the ACLU. The National Rifle Association had so much extra money left in its PAC in the last election cycle that it ended up spending millions of dollars on things that it wasn't even required to use PAC money for. It has 4 million members. If each of those 4 million members gives $10 a year, they will have one of the biggest -- probably the biggest PAC in history, $40 million. And there is no showing whatsoever -- they've just raised their dues from $25 to $35. If they just say the dues are still $25. But if you believe with us that political advocacy in this case and talking to candidates and voters who are voting the candidates about how precious the Second Amendment is, please give us $10. If and when a day comes when they can't fund their advocacy in this narrow window, with respect to broadcast ads targeted at particular races, the courts will be open to them. This Court has announced an exception to the PAC requirement in MCFL, and the courts are available to any corporation that wants to -- or labor union that wants to come in and say we don't --",
  "Indeed, Mr. Chief Justice, but in MCFL itself, for example, we have an as-applied exemption made by the Court in order to satisfy constitutional concerns. And our only submission is that on its face, this is in an area in which the need for legislation is compelling, but the drafting challenges are daunting. This effort by Congress at least deserves a chance to protect itself. Now, just to clarify --",
  "Well, it should have the opportunity to prove that the parade of horribles that our opponents, the type of hypotheticals, we won't be able to fund a PAC, or we want to run --",
  "How well I know. But in all seriousness, Mr. Chief Justice, I will be one of the happiest people on the face of the planet when I sit down today, however you decide. But we're talking about a facial challenge, a facial challenge. And the express advocacy test, the contribution limits and expenditure limits were not declared unconstitutional on their face when this Court found in MCFL that were some PAC burdens for some types of corporations that the First Amendment should not require to be borne. Now, with respect to the media exception, I think there may be a misunderstanding about what this exception actually says. It's not an exception for General Electric or people who own medias. It's on page 29A of the government's jurisdictional statement. It accepts a communication appearing in a news story, commentary or editorial distributed through the facilities of any broadcasting station. It's not an exception for General Electric or even the company that owns a broadcast --",
  "To the contrary. Anybody who wants to run an issue ad, General Electric can run it and it's going to have to run it through its PAC, just like anything else.",
  "NBC on its editorial or news story can say whatever it wants.",
  "May I answer? Thank you. When Congress finds what there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest exists, that companies that own broadcasting stations are misusing that privilege, Congress can and will address it. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Unlike the two cases in which you heard argument yesterday, and unlike Oregon v. Elstad, the original inculpatory statement in this case was elicited not merely in violation of a prophylactic rule, but of the Constitution itself, specifically the Sixth Amendment right of an accused to the assistance of counsel throughout his criminal prosecution, a right designed to protect equality in the adversarial process by a --",
  "Well, it's -- Your Honor, I guess I have a two-fold answer. First of all, the -- the constitutional right involved is the Sixth Amendment right, unlike in Miranda, the Fifth Amendment right of self-incrimination. And in -- in Oregon v. Elstad and Chavez v. Martinez, this Court recognized that although the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination right is not completed until the statement or its fruits are introduced at trial, the primary illegality, as this Court has used the phrase, is the coercion of the confession, and the Elstad rule doesn't apply where the primary illegality is constitutionally-proscribed conduct. And here, this Court has not formally decided whether the Sixth Amendment is violated at the time the uncounseled, post-indictment statement is deliberately elicited, or only when the statement or fruits are admitted, that briefs of both sides rehearse for the Court somewhat conflicting statements in different opinions. We rely on the cases cited in footnote 5 on page 8 of our reply brief, but for purposes of this case, Your Honor, it doesn't matter, because in Elstad, this Court made clear, and reiterated in Chavez, that although the Fifth Amendment violation is incomplete at the time a confession is coerced, nonetheless the fruits of that confession have to be suppressed under the derivative evidence rule, unless the Government carries its burden to prove sufficient attenuation of taint. And therefore, even if the conduct deliberately eliciting from Mr. Fellers his inculpatory statement at a time when the officers knew he had been indicted, and the prosecution knew that he had a right to the advice of counsel, the fruits of that statement under Nix and Wade have to be suppressed. That's a rule that this Court has applied in Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and Sixth Amendment cases.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, I don't -- I don't think I would call it fiction. I'm no more able to -- to testify than the member of this Court would be as to exactly what training the police are told. But this Court has long established, long maintained that the Sixth Amendment cuts very bright lines. It is specific to the offense and it begins only when, but when, the state makes the unilateral determination to change its formal relationship with an individual from one in which the individual may or may not be under investigation, but the --",
  "Well, they -- they aren't, Your Honor, and I don't think this is a matter of technicality or formality. It is a matter of formalism, but the two different amendments -- the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, and the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel throughout criminal prosecution, protect very different things. The first protects voluntariness, and the second protects the right of someone as to whom the Government has formally set its face and invoked a formal adversarial process.",
  "Your -- Your Honor, it's -- it is entirely true that if the Court agrees with -- agrees with our submission here, that the Government can very easily conform its conduct simply by not conducting uncounseled interrogations or elicitations prior to changing its status. But the -- the -- we have to examine, this Court has exhorted counsel over and over again to be clear about what the underlying right is protected in determining what the appropriate remedy is. And the right here is not coercion. The right here is not just addressed at police. It's addressed at the prosecution. And there is a difference. You may call it technical, but it is in fact the hallmark of our adversary system that once the Government decides to invoke a formal adversary process, it proceeds on the supposition that each side deals with each other, A, at arm's length, and B, assisted by the advice of counsel, who will prevent each side, and in particularly the defendant, from, as this Court has explained in -- from conviction resulting from his own ignorance of his legal and constitutional rights, and that's what's being protected. The unindicted individual, as to whom the Government may be conducting an investigation, doesn't have that formal right, but once the Government invokes our adversarial system, it invokes a set of protections that protect, not an individual's right to be protected from coercion or involuntariness -- that's protected no matter when the custodial -",
  "Oh no, of course not. Your Honor has made clear for the - in his opinion for the Court in Patterson v. Illinois -- I believe it was Your Honor -- in any event, the Court made clear in Patterson v. Illinois that the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel doesn't prevent the Government from eliciting statements from an indicted defendant. It requires that the accused either have counsel or make a waiver of the right to counsel, and the Court --",
  "There only is a violation of a right, Your Honor, if what -- if the police statements and conduct amount to what this Court has deemed deliberate elicitation. That is, that what the Court has said in a half a dozen cases is that the Government may not do without counsel is deliberately elicit incriminating statements in the absence of his lawyer.",
  "I am -- I am absolutely certain that that's what happened here, and the --",
  "Yes. The magistrate who heard that police officers, Justice O'Connor, found specifically that officers --",
  "Yes. He said it was, quote, designed to elicit a response -- I'm quoting from page 103 of the joint appendix --",
  "It is.",
  "Well, it's - I think, Your Honor, Justice Scalia, it's -- this is a mixed question of law and fact under Miller v. Fenton and Thompson v. Keohane. But because --",
  "The Eighth --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, the Eighth Circuit -- two judges, the majority, the panel in the Eighth Circuit, concluded that it wasn't interrogation. The concurring judge --",
  "-- pointed out, Judge Riley pointed out, that under the Sixth Amendment, unlike the Fifth, interrogation is not the standard. The standard is deliberate elicitation, or, as this Court has also phrased it, whether the prosecution, quote, intentionally creates a situation likely to induce the accused to make incriminating statements without the advise of counsel.",
  "That is -- the -- the -- I don't believe the Eighth Circuit made any such finding, but the magistrate who heard the two officers testify and evaluated their credibility made a determination, Justice Scalia, that is a mixed question of fact and law. The inquiry under the Sixth Amendment, deliberate elicitation or intentional creation of a situation, or purposeful conduct, which are the words this Court has used, involve a determination, among other things, about the credibility of what the officers said. And when the magistrate concluded that they -- that their conduct was designed to elicit a response, and that it was not made for any purpose other than to get a response --",
  "There was no debate about what they said, but -- but there was a credibility finding made by the magistrate, because the --",
  "Well, when you have -- when you -- because there is a subjective intent here, the subjective intent of whether Officer Bliemeister, he came to the house knowing that this man had been indicted, and said, we are here to discuss with you your involvement with methamphetamine and your involvement with four individuals.",
  "Your Honor, I'm -- I'm simply reciting back for -- for you the court's instructions, and -- and saying that if the standard is deliberate elicitation and intentionally creating a situation, it essentially, in terms of providing a line, it proscribes what the police may not deliberately do, and --",
  "-- but deliberateness, I think, is a finding of the magistrate, which -- to which the Eighth Circuit and this Court owe deference.",
  "Your Honor, perhaps, but designed to elicit, it strikes me as including a subjective component. But even if I'm wrong, I submit that the magistrate was correct as an a priori matter in saying, look, these people -- these officers -- these agents of the prosecution, came to this man's house. They not only knew he had been indicted, Officer Bliemeyer had been the witness --",
  "Bliemeister -- had been the witness before the grand jury, and he comes --",
  "I don't remember what the officer did in Elstad.",
  "Well, that --",
  "I -- I actually don't agree. I think -- I think for other reasons, that is, the -- the fact that this is a Sixth Amendment it doesn't matter. But I do think --",
  "-- when the police officers come and say, we are here to discuss with you the following things, which happened to be the precise things that he has just been indicted for, that is a paradigm -- paradigmatic deliberate elicitation.",
  "And --",
  "Well, if -- if -- Mr. --",
  "Because the functional analysis depends on the right being protected. The Fifth Amendment right does not embed a policy against deliberate elicitation of information from suspects. In fact, our system embraces that. And if there was a violation in Elstad, it was --",
  "It -- the difference is what's being protected. What's being protected in the Fifth is coercion. What's being protected in the Sixth in this instance is precisely what --",
  "Well, yes. And what the Sixth Amendment protects in terms, Justice Souter, is that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to the assistance of counsel.",
  "Absolutely. And that gets us right to Elstad, and the line that this Court drew in Elstad at the very outset of its opinion, which is that the consequences of an interrogation in violation of Miranda differ importantly from the consequences of a violation of the Constitution itself, that is, primary illegality that goes directly, without prophylaxis, to what the Constitution proscribes. And this Court said over and over and over again in Elstad that we will not apply a derivative evidence rule where the violation is only the former, but we will apply it in the latter. And that is the key distinction in this case. The distinction is not that the statements that they elicited from Mr. Fellers at his home didn't also violate Miranda, if he was in custody and the court found that he was, they did.",
  "But --",
  "But Justice Kennedy, I submit to you that it doesn't matter as a matter of constitutional prophylaxis. It may very well -- what the police officers know is, they knew they had to give him his Miranda warnings there. That we can be sure of. And they also knew that there would be consequences for not doing it, and this is not just the police. If it -- if it please the Court, this is the prosecution. Once there is an indictment, the police are not acting on their own. The police are part of the government prosecution, and if police don't know that, and are trying to game the system the way we heard it yesterday, it's the burden of the prosecution -- the prosecution and the Government to make sure that they do understand that. What we're talking about here is the preservation of -- as this Court has said it -- equality -- equality of each side once the Government unilaterally define -- changes its posture with respect to someone so that that person is accused, and when it does that, it has to make -- it has to take steps to avoid interfering with the ability of the defendant at all critical stages and all confrontations to proceed based on ignorance or misapprehension of his rights or the legal consequences. I realize this sounds like --",
  "Yes, Your Honor. Now, the -- the Eighth Circuit was incorrect, because it applied the wrong standard. It asked whether there was interrogation, when this Court made clear in Rhode Island v. Innis that that is not the test under the Sixth Amendment for good reasons, and in any event, this was the, quote, functional equivalent of interrogation. I mean --",
  "No. It -- it said -- what the Eighth Circuit said is, look, we don't think that there was a primary illegality, and therefore, we don't have to discuss --",
  "-- what the fruits consequences are.",
  "I don't think so, Your Honor.",
  "Because the question presented in the petition, the second question presented in the petition is, okay, assuming that there was a violation of the Sixth Amendment in the first interrogation, does the invocation, the mere invocation of Miranda warnings, cleanse that taint?",
  "That's correct.",
  "I would.",
  "Well --",
  "Okay.",
  "I'll -- I'll answer Justice O'Connor's question first and then your question. Justice O'Connor, the -- the -- the point here is that this Court has uniformly held that where there is conduct that constitutes primary illegality in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, or Sixth Amendments, not just a prophylactic rule, but the constitutional requirement itself, the remedy is, you apply the derivative evidence rule, which puts the burden on the Government to prove that the taint has sufficiently attenuated.",
  "He absolutely can. And our case doesn't --",
  "He --",
  "Our -- our case, Your Honor, doesn't depend on any argument or showing that the second statement was either involuntary or that the waiver of the right to counsel was not knowing and intelligent. Our submission is that the second statement is the fruit of the poisonous tree, just as if it were a piece of inanimate evidence. There's nothing wrong if somebody said -- with what the -- if police going and finding the body in the Nix case, the Christian burial case, but it's tainted because they got the -- that information derived from a violation of the Sixth Amendment. I had not up here --",
  "Well, you -- you have never held in a Sixth Amendment --",
  "You've never held the -- the precise question that's presented here for sure. But you have held that where there is conduct that violates the Sixth Amendment, this is Nix and Wade, the fruits of that conduct, regardless of what happens thereafter, are excludable as fruit of the poisonous tree, unless the Government shoulders its taint-attenuation burden. And you have also held in a variety of cases that, starting with Wong Sun, that where the fruit is testimonial evidence, it too has to be excluded with the understanding that the administer -- the intervening administration of Miranda warnings are potent evidence, but they are not sufficient in and of themselves to establish taint attenuation. You said it in Brown. You said it last term in Kaupp v. Texas. You've said it in Dunaway and any number of other cases.",
  "The first statement in the first -- I mean, as a -- that -- this is a sort of a common sense, practical analysis, but in the first statement he was -- he acknowledged that he had used methamphetamines and he had associated with the four individuals that the police officer named. And you, Justice Breyer, the indictment was conspiracy to possess methamphetamines with intent to distribute and to distribute. He made very inculpatory statements. Thirty minutes later, he executes a Miranda warning -- waiver -- in the station house, and he is asked, okay, tell us more about this possession and tell us person by person about your association with those four people. They then go on and ask more questions about other people, but in this case, the link between the two is as direct as one can possibly imagine. I mean, this Court has established a -- has long recognized a presumption that where the -- when the Government acquires evidence in violation of the Constitution, any substantially similar evidence obtained by the police subsequent to that derives from it unless the Government can prove it doesn't. That was waived.",
  "The taint --",
  "Your Honor, the taint --",
  "The taint, which this Court in Elstad, in part IIa of its opinion in Elstad, said was insufficient -- IIb -- was insufficient to prove involuntariness, is in fact what demonstrates that there is fruit of the poisonous tree here in the link, and that is the accepted, common sense proposition that an uncounseled accused, from whom the Government deliberately elicits an unwarned, incriminatory statement after it institutes adversarial proceedings, is erroneously likely to believe that there is little to be gained and much to be lost from attempting to avoid further incrimination.",
  "This Court recognized it in Bayer, in Brown, in --",
  "Well, in Brown, for example, it said that the second warrant statement, quote, was clearly the result and fruit of the first. The fact that Brown had made one statement believed by him to be admissible bolstered the pressures for him to give the second, or at least vitiated any incentive on his part to avoid self-incrimination.",
  "It is the same thing. In that case they were talking about the second statement, which was preceded by a waiver of counsel, and making not the, Your Honor, not the legal judgment that the second statement was there for coerced or involuntary, but the practical -- what this Court has described as the psychological and practical disadvantage of having confessed a first time can be regarded as a fruit of the first.",
  "Yes. That's -- as --",
  "-- as -- as Justice Harlan stated in his concurrence in Darwin, which is only a concurrence, but I think is sort of the --",
  "You rejected it, Your Honor, as evidence or as constituting or -- or eliciting a presumption of involuntariness. But you did it only after -- in part IIa of your opinion in Elstad, you said, derivative evidence rule doesn't apply. Fruits are not going to be excluded from Elstad -- from a Miranda violation. Now, the Court said in part IIb, now we have to deal with the contention that he says it's involuntary, and his only evidence that it's involuntary is that it was the cat out of the bag and there was this psychological compulsion. That's too attenuated and hypothetical to constitute a presumption of compulsion, but it is precisely what this Court has recognized in Brown and Dunaway and Bayer and Taylor and Harrison as being a psychological fact --",
  "Right. And the -- the only burden in the -- in the case yesterday that I don't have is that the primary illegality was a violation of Miranda, and not of the Fifth Amendment prohibition against coerced confessions itself. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is whether section 209(a) of the Clean Air Act, which is reproduced at page 36a of our brief, preempts very modest fleet purchase rules which apply only to vehicles that are already commercially available, that is, that cannot have an effect on manufacture -- cannot require manufacturers to produce or sell anything, and which were adopted by a unique airshed in which 90 percent of all toxic air pollution derives from motor vehicles. And the answer to that question is no because the text and the context of the Clean Air Act, title II of the Clean Air Act that deals with motor vehicles, show that Congress intended the word standard in section 209 to be used in the same way that it is used in section 202 and, indeed, throughout the entirety of title II -- title II. It's used 100 times, I'm told by an amicus, in section 202 alone, and every single time that it is used there, it is used to refer to an obligation placed on manufacturers, that the vehicles they produce and sell meet specified emissions characteristics. No one contends that that definition, the way the word is used in section 202, covers the rules in this case. Now, express preemption -- it requires discerning Congress' intent. It's not an exercise in definitional possibilities, this Court has reminded us many times. Now, you can read every brief from our opponents. Every different brief offers up some other definition, and their briefs in related cases have done the same. And we've heard no definition this morning. They look to the dictionary definition of standard or criteria or test, and they're reproduced in their briefs. But they -- they concede that there is no dictionary definition that they offer that coincides with the rule that they seek because they concede that Congress did not intend to cover incentive programs or tax programs even though, like purchase rules, they operate through the market on manufacturers and not directly on manufacturers.",
  "Well --",
  "A -- a rule that --",
  "A -- one could -- I believe that a good argument could be made that that rule is preempted because it conflicts with the overall purposes of the Clean Air Act. But --",
  "But, Justice Breyer, please let me finish.",
  "This is a very important point. The challenge here is that these rules are expressly preempted -- it's in the question presented in the petitioners' brief -- expressly preempted by the first sentence of section 209(a), and it is expressly preempted because these are standards. And our submission is --",
  "Yes, and --",
  "Here is my -- here is my first effort at an answer. The word standard, as it is used in 202 and in the other provisions of title II that deal with different types of standards, the standards with respect to fuel, standards with respect to buses, standards -- standards in section 243 that deal with the Federal clean fuel purchase program, are all obligations that are placed directly on manufacturers. The Congress and the EPA recognized when section 246 was enacted, which is the Federal fleet purchase program --",
  "Well --",
  "No, it's --",
  "Justice --",
  "I'll try -- I'll be efficient and try and answer two questions at once then. First of all, 209 doesn't refer -- doesn't prohibit anything relating to a standard. It prohibits standards relating to motor vehicle emissions just as section 202 in the very first sentence authorizes the Federal Government to promulgate standards applicable to the emission of motor vehicles. Now, standards, as the word is used in 202 and throughout title II, refers to emission characteristics or the obligation of manufacturers to sell and produce cars. If you look at section 202(g) or 202(h) and 202(i), for example, those are instances of subsections where it is used not just to refer to the emissions characteristics themselves, but also the obligation on manufacturers and sellers. And in fact, if you look at section 203 of the act, which is called Prohibited Acts -- it's the enforcement provisions -- it is directed at manufacturers and sellers.",
  "Well, I think the -- the word standard -- I'll -- I'll say this one more time and then retreat to another -- another argument. The word standard, as it is used, for example, in 202(g), is used both to refer to the emissions characteristics, numerical or otherwise, and an obligation placed on manufacturers and sellers to do something about that. And the -- let me -- let me give you my second line of argument here --",
  "Well, there are provisions in section 203, which is the Prohibited Acts, that it -- it is imposed on the people who make cars and requires them or limits them in what those people can make.",
  "It -- it is -- Justice Scalia, there is a provision in section 203 of the act, the Prohibited Acts, that deals with the instance in which a manufacturer, for example, produces cars overseas and then tries to sell noncompliant cars through a distributor or some other entity. Those people are covered. But when Congress considered in 1990 its own fleet purchase rules, we're talking here about very limited fleet purchase rules that -- talking about my rules -- have a commercial availability exception. They do not -- they cannot be read to require manufacturers to make anything they don't make or sellers to sell anything they don't sell.",
  "Well, there may be -- the -- the vehicle has to be -- the rules make quite clear that the vehicles have to be available and able to be used by that user in the locality, the fuel --",
  "There -- the petitioner does not say it's very difficult to get, and that footnote 7 on page 8 of their brief is truly the 13th chime of the clock in their argument. The -- if we had to establish a factual record in this case -- and there is none -- I am told by my client that these exemptions are sought for some of these rules never because the vehicles are -- are readily available, for example, with respect to street sweepers, and on other vehicles, they are readily given. If somebody --",
  "The 13th chime of the clock is --",
  "It's on page 8, footnote 7 of their reply brief.",
  "They say that, oh, well, about commercial availability, it's just not true. The district that promulgated these rules said it only applies when it's commercially available. The State that enacted a provision that authorized these rules has filed a brief in this case saying it applies only when it's commercially available. No one in this case or any other case has ever argued that that commercial availability exemption doesn't exist until footnote 7 of their reply brief, and it is simply wrong. But my point generally about the -- the meaning of the word standard in the Federal act, title II, is in 1990 Congress enacted its own fleet purchasing rules, and they are codified in --",
  "No, no. Congress put into -- amended the Clean Air Act to require certain States that have nonattainment areas to include within their State implementation plans either a fleet -- a set of fleet purchase rules or some alternative that they would propose that would be equally efficacious in cleaning the air.",
  "It is not expressly preempted by section 209(a). It would be subject to conflict preemption principles, as this Court went through in Geier v. American Honda, if it could be shown that --",
  "I think -- I think it may well be preempted by -- under conflict preemption principles, not express preemption, if it could be shown that this is really a sales or production -- this is really an obligation that is masquerading as a purchase requirement. That would be the analysis --",
  "To be sure --",
  "Because standards, as I said --",
  "Yes.",
  "That is correct.",
  "A standard is -- is a requirement that is imposed on manufacturers and that distinction is drawn throughout title II --",
  "Justice Scalia, it's -- I actually think that 209(b) is important proof for our premise that section 209(a), the word standard, has to be read -- it has to be read to be used in the same way as section 202. And clearly the way that -- when I -- when we talk about production mandates, I -- it's -- it's actually the Congress in section 249(h) used the word production or sales mandates. The EPA in its rules and in its letter that was submitted under a primary jurisdiction referral to the First Circuit talks about production requirements. It's shorthand. But I readily agree that when 209(b) or 209(a) or 202 apply -- when I'm talking about production mandates, I'm talking about an obligation that's placed on the manufacturers about what they produce and can sell. It's one and the same. There was a presumption that they would try and sell what they produced and they would produce the things that they want to sell. The point is that in -- when Congress enacted the Federal fleet purchase program, it drew a -- the same distinction that is shot through title II between standards, which has a very limited meaning, and requirements. It's a distinction that exists in section 116 of the act, which is on page 3a of our appendix, that preserves State authorities. And what Congress said and what the EPA said and what Senator Levin, who was very ably representing the interests of Detroit in 1990, said is these fleet purchase rules, because they are directed at purchasers may very well have a tremendous impact on manufacturers. They may cause a race to the top. But they are different than production standards, production mandates, or requirements placed directly on manufacturers.",
  "Justice --",
  "They are imposed on the people who make the cars when they sell them. That's because, Justice Scalia--",
  "I -- I wish that I could have said it that concisely, but that's the point that I'm making.",
  "They are --",
  "My submission to the Court, Your Honor, is that standards, as the term is used throughout title II, refers to the supply side of motor vehicles, the people who make them and the people who sell them, and that when Congress wanted to make a rule that dealt with purchasers, which applies only indirectly against manufacturers, it used the word requirement. And that's because --",
  "Both 209(a) --",
  "Look, section -- subsection (d) of 209 applies to vehicles that are not new. 209(a) and 209(b) apply to new vehicles. What -- 209(b) is the presumptive waiver for California alone of the preemption provision in 209(a). I -- I don't want to be pedantic, but let's -- we -- we started talking about 1965 and 1967, and I think it's tremendously revealing, in terms of the purposes, what Congress intended by standard in 209, to understand that in 1963 Congress enacted the first version of the Clean Air Act. And it basically didn't authorize the Federal Government to do anything other than help States do their part in cleaning up the air. That didn't work very well, and in 1965 Congress enacted the provision that is now 202 that says we are going to take from the realm of a traditional State authority this much for the Federal Government. They can and will set standards applicable to motor vehicle emissions. Now, for the intervening 2 years, the manufacturers came to Congress and said this doesn't make things better, it makes things worse because there are a number of States that are promulgating their own mandates on how we build engines and what kind of equipment we have. And in footnote 7 of our brief, we cite a report by HEW that categorizes what each State was doing. It's a 1976 report. And what they were doing was not putting requirements on purchasers. They were saying to manufacturers, if you want to sell a car in our State, it's got to have a whiz-bang or a doodad, or it has to meet the following characteristics. And the manufacturers said, we can only engineer and manufacture to one standard. So in 1967, Congress responded to that by enacting what is now section 209, and it compromised. It said, well, we're not going to make you manufacture and engineer only to one standard. We're going to make an exception for California, which was there before the Federal Government was there. But other than California, which is subsection (b), no State can do what it is that the EPA is doing in section 202. And there are a number of rules of statutory interpretation, leaving aside the presumption against preemption in this area of historic police -- State police power, that require you to read for an express preemption point, not a general, broad conflict preemption argument that is not advanced here, that the word standard is to be read as narrowly as reasonable to preserve as much for the States as possible.",
  "And it has to be -- it's only coherent if it means that the States are precluded from doing what EPA was mandated to do, which is to tell manufacturers, if you've got a vehicle over 6,000 pounds, it can't emit more than X, Y, and Z grams per mile. What the manufacturers cared about was that they not have to make what is -- was subsequently called a third car. They didn't want to have to build different cars and engines for different parts of the country. And that's why a rule that is directed only at purchasers and has built within it an exception for anything that is not commercially available or can't be used for the purpose that the user wants to use it for is not a standard.",
  "It's a difficult question that --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Well --",
  "I'm here to answer questions, and I apologize.",
  "I think it's --",
  "Justice Breyer, you are not way off base.",
  "You're slightly off base, but not way off.",
  "You've raised -- you've raised three points, and I'll try and address them in turn. They're -- the -- they're -- what they're saying is, look, there's no big deal because -- because this airshed, one of 33 in California, could take the concerns of its citizens -- even though it's mandated by the State to promulgate these rules, it could go to the bureaucracy in Sacramento and try and get that bureaucracy to include in its list of what it sends to the centralized command and control bureaucracy in Washington permission to enact rules that scientific studies show cause 9,000 premature deaths in the district a year. Now, it's true, but it would not avail, that is, particulate emissions from motor -- toxic emissions from motor vehicles and diesel vehicles. Now, what about Houston? Houston -- right now the South Coast is the only extreme nonattainment zone in the country, but Houston has been knocking at the door for several years. The -- the waiver provision that they're referring to in 209(b) would not avail Houston. It wouldn't avail Phoenix which has its own unique airshed problems with particulate emissions. And therefore, our submission is if it's a standard, yes. If you say this is a standard, we will go to the State of California and say please sponsor this rule and please ask the EPA to give permission for us to be able to impose these fleet purchasing rules.",
  "I believe so. There is a provision in the California Health and Safety Code that says that the California Air Resources Board is the relevant State agency for purposes of 209(b). But more generally, if the -- the point here is do you determine what Congress' purpose is by the effect. That's fine.",
  "No. If -- if it is a command to manufacturers with respect to emissions characteristics of the vehicles they make, it is a standard, as that term is used throughout title II. If it is directed at purchasers and, as Senator Levin and the EPA explained in 1990, only affect manufacturers and sellers through the marketplace, even though it may have a substantial effect, it is no different than the many incentives and differential tax programs that they say aren't covered. Look, California --",
  "Yes, indeed.",
  "And -- and these --",
  "That is absolutely correct.",
  "No.",
  "With respect, Justice Breyer --",
  "Here you are completely off base.",
  "The rules each -- I'm not talking about CARB's statewide standards, but the rules challenged here have an exception for anytime somebody can show that the vehicle they want is either not commercially available or can't be used. Look at page 50a of the joint appendix. The rules are all in the joint appendix. That happens to be the rule that deals with the one that my book opened up to. It's buses. And it says on page 50 of the joint appendix that this -- an exception -- an exemption to these fleet purchase rules where no alternative-fuel engine and chassis configuration is available commercially or could be used. And so this is the situation that -- our submission is that these things can't possibly have -- impose a mandate on manufacturers. And in fact, look -- we -- we discuss in our brief a little bit that California has a program where it provides, I think, a 75 or 90 percent rebate to school districts if they buy buses that are fueled by alternative-fuel vehicles. Now, is that going to have an effect on the kinds of buses that school districts buy? Of course. And is it going to have a big effect on manufacturers? Sure. And therefore, when we're talking about something that is mandatory, as opposed to something that is voluntary, they -- on page 7 of their reply brief, they make a distinction between voluntary standards and mandatory standards. From the relevant perspective, that is the perspective of the manufacturer, they are the same, as Senator Levin and the EPA explained. They operate on the manufacturers through the market. Now, to be sure, there -- you can come up and I think Justice O'Connor came up with the extreme example of no one in our State can buy a diesel vehicle. And what I'm saying is that one could argue and one might make a very good argument that if it is a mandate that's imposed on manufacturers or sellers that is masquerading as a purchase rule, where it really has that effect, you may find that substance will prevail over form, or you may find -- I think it would be more appropriate -- that this simply conflicts with the fundamental objective of the Clean Air Act under the Hines v. Davidovitz test. But that's not the challenge that was brought here, and that's --",
  "Conflict preemption and not express preemption. And that will -- that analysis and that mode of analysis will allow the courts to deal with this parade of horribles that has never come true and may never come true if the political branches don't. But if you look at the history of what was going on in 1965 or 1967 -- this is Congress' purpose -- no one was talking about -- no manufacturers were concerned about purchase rules. They were concerned about having to engineer and manufacture a third vehicle.",
  "Oh, I think -- no, no, no. With -- with respect, this -- this statute shut down cold, Justice Kennedy, precisely what was going on in 1967.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves a regulation promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board to govern the disclosure of fees imposed for exceeding a credit limit. It does not involve any challenge to the fees themselves or any contention that the fees were not disclosed. Unquestionably they were. This case concerns only how such fees should be characterized when they are disclosed.",
  "Well, as the Solicitor General has explained in his brief for the Federal Reserve Board, ordinarily the arrangement between banks -- that is, the banks that issue the cards and the banks that do the corresponding relationship with the merchants -- have an agreement between the merchants and the banks where the merchant will be liable for fraudulent use of the card or the other unless it obtains authorization to process the charge. And so in the ordinary practice, the board has explained, a merchant may or may not, is not required to, but may well call in the charge or submit the account number to the issuing bank via the correspondent bank and get an approval, yes or no, to process the charge. Now, the board has explained that when the issuing bank authorizes the merchant to process the charge, that two important things don't happen. One, it does not in any way represent a renegotiation between the consumer and the issuing bank, and it says nothing about the overall credit limit. And two, the issuing bank often will have no idea whether the charge being authorized will or will not trigger a credit limit of the consumer for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that, as the board explains, credits and payments aren't instantly reflected, merchants often don't put the true amount of the charge in. They may, as hotels and -- and rental car companies do -- often block very large amounts because they don't know what the ultimate charge will be. And there is also a recognition in the industry, the board explains, of a certain tolerance. That is, the merchant -- the credit card company won't always want to cut somebody off whenever it has a suspicion that they may hit their credit limit because the merchant has a relationship with the customer. And since the system of information is so imperfect, the issuing bank also has a relationship with its consumer and doesn't want to embarrass the consumer. So the short answer to that -- the short version of the very long answer is in the ordinary course, merchants have an incentive to seek authorization, but they're not required to, and the authorization that's given doesn't reflect knowledge by the issuer that a credit limit will be exceeded.",
  "Well, the creditor -- the consumer may or may not know that his or her credit limit was exceeded, but of course, that information is entirely within the knowledge of the -- the potential knowledge of the consumer because the consumer does know what or -­ what charges he or she has made and what payments he or she has made.",
  "Well, the -­",

  "It is true with the following caveats. I'm not trying to fight the hypothetical. I just want to make sure -­",
  "And I can't, and here's why, Justice Stevens. I -- I mean no disrespect. But many, many credit card issuers do not imply an over-limit fee on a transactional basis. They apply it, for example, if at the end of the month the balance exceeds the limit as opposed to whether a particular transaction sort of spikes it over the limit one time. And so I'm just trying to be completely accurate. Now, the term -- I think it's very important -­",
  "I think that must -- there must be instances in which that is true. But the term, credit limit, Your Honor, is a term of art that is recognized in the industry, that is reflected in the Federal Reserve Board regulations, and it draws an important distinction between increasing a credit limit, an established credit limit, upon an application and authorizing a point-of-sale transaction.",
  "The merchant has a safe harbor, Your Honor. The merchant is told, if you pay this charge and it turns out not to be collectible for any reason, we will hold you harmless. And that's the reason that this between issuers and merchants, as a way to encourage merchants to allow use of the card. Now -­",
  "No.",
  "My understanding, Justice Souter, is it varies depending on issuer and card, but that is, some -- some cards will -- all -- all -- well, there are some credit cards and charge cards that don't have limits, but when they have a limit, the limit is required to be explicated in the initial disclosures. And in the solicitation, the disclosure, and all periodic statements, the lender, the credit card issuer, is required to identify the credit limit and specify that fees that are charged for exceeding a credit limit will be the following amount.",
  "Well, I don't -- I will explain what difference it makes. No one has yet explained, neither the respondent in this case nor the Sixth Circuit, how the consumer is benefitted by the rule that she's advocating or the Sixth Circuit's rule, but here's how it works. In the open-end credit relationship, the credit card or charge card relationship, there are three relevant events. One is the solicitation or advertisement to invite someone to enter into a relationship. That's called the solicitation. The -­",
  "For a purchase of a credit card. Citibank card, and there are certain disclosures that are required in those solicitations. If you send back something that says, yes, I want to have a -- I want one of your credit cards, the act and the regulations require that certain disclosures be made at that point, and that's called the initial disclosure. And then the third event is the periodic statement, when you get your statement every month or so. Now, with respect to the solicitation and the initial disclosure, the consequences of calling this a finance charge or a component of the finance charge versus an other charge are zero. That is, in both of those instances, the lender, the issuer, must disclose that there will be charges paid -- fees assessed for exceeding a credit limit and how much it is. And they're not characterized there as part of the finance charge or otherwise. statement of what the APR, the annualized percentage rate, is, but the APR in those statements refers only to the periodic rate, the interest rate that's going to be charged to all -- applied to all charges. In the -­",
  "Yes.",
  "Because you don't know whether there will be late charges or over-limit charges.",
  "Not at those two stages, but at the third stage, that is, the periodic statement, when you get your bill every month, there is a difference there. In both instances, there will be a specification of over­ limit charge, but if the Sixth Circuit is right, in those instances in which the issuer actually knew that the charge it authorized the merchant to process resulted in the consequence of an over-limit charge, it would be called over-limit charge finance charge. That is, there would be a line item that specifies what it is, just like any other charge or any other purchase or payment, and the amount. But it would affect the annual percentage rate, what's called the historical annual percentage rate, in the periodic statement. instances in the act where the APR, calculated retroactively on the monthly statement, is higher than what was the APR that was disclosed? Justice Stevens, because there are certain types of charges that may or may not occur. For example, if you use your card to get cash at the cash machine or something that will be -- will -- that are charged in the finance -­ that are part of the finance charge and will, therefore, affect the APR on the monthly statement, but won't be disclosed to the -­",
  "Well -­",
  "Well, her -- I'm not saying that her theory or the Sixth Circuit's rule couldn't work. It would require a great deal of additional rulemaking by the fraction, is a percentage, the numerator of which is the component of all the individual charges and the denominator is something that, in the context of an over­ limit fee, is unclear. Does it apply to the transaction that it was applied to? Is it the average monthly balance? Is it for the whole month or part of the month? It's not impossible. But what it -- what it is is directly contrary to the two objectives of TILA. The purpose of TILA is to come up with bright line classifications that are readily complied with by issuers and that help consumers compare competing costs of credit. That is manifest in Congress' purpose, and a rule that requires the treatment month to month, charge to charge depend on what the issuer knew at the time it authorized some charge that may later be determined to have triggered at -- the -- allowing the borrower to exceed the credit limit would cause these monthly APR's to vary widely and, it seems to me, can only create confusion and inability to say, well, gee, I just got an application or a -- a thing in the mail from, you know, Citibank saying 17.3 percent, but I just looked at my statement and it's 79 percent.",
  "Well, yes, in the month in which it has occurred because, with respect to the next month, whatever finance charge was applied and -- and continues as a balance will also have applied to it the finance charge, that is, the interest rate that would apply. So, but with -- there is a consequence in the month in which it is applied; that is, for whatever days it's outstanding, up until the -- the end of the -- the card's grace period, a finance charge could be applied to that other charge.",
  "These cards typically have a grace period in which you can pay off your balance and you don't have to pay any finance charge, but if you don't, whatever charges are carried forward, whether they derive from or finance charges in the previous month, something is charged against it. May I reserve the balance of my time?",
  "The question of whether or not we disclosed this fee properly within the regulation was passed on by the lower court. It is the law of the case. The lower court held, as the second part of its ruling, that, quote, unequivocally the regulation required us to disclose this fee as an other charge. Now, Justice Scalia is correct that how you interpret the Fed's bright line regulation which says, at page 2 of our blue brief, the following charges are not finance charges. Charges for exceeding a credit limit, of course, depends on what credit limit means, and credit limit is a term of art. Everybody in the industry understands it. Even the respondent at page 1 of her brief, she says, quote, in the middle of the page, a credit limit represents the amount of credit the card issuer has preapproved the consumer to obtain. There's no possible allegation in this case that she ever asked for an extension of her credit limit or received an extension of her credit limit. And there is a reason that the board came up with an absolute bright line rule, and the reason is that before 1980, when Congress mandated classifications in order to simplify things for creditors and consumers, the Federal Reserve Board confronted -- confronted questions like many of the hypotheticals that Justice Stevens and others have asked here. Well, what if -- what if they knew that it was going to exceed it and what if somebody actually called and asked permission. I don't want to be embarrassed in the store. Will you authorize this? The board literally -- and some of -- many of these letter interpretations are cited in the briefs in this case, although not all of them. The board drove itself crazy trying to answer all of these hypotheticals and came up with a set of letter rulings, exacerbated by the Federal courts also trying to come up with their own interpretations, that made it impossible for issuers to come up with formulaic disclosures that would prevent them from being socked with huge class action awards and allowed them to present information that consumers could compare. And so Congress said in 1980 we want bright line classifications, and that's exactly what the board did. In 1980, the board said that it was amending its regulations to, quote, substitute where possible precise, easily applied rules for principles that create ambiguity and -­",

  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 28 U.S.C., section 1782 authorizes discovery for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal, upon application by an interested person. Those are words of indeterminate scope. No one in this case contends that they should be applied to the limits of definitional possibility, that words like interested person, for use in, proceeding require a contextual interpretation, and the context in this case is comity in discovery. As -- in language that everyone in this case quotes, the 1964 Senate report characterized the statute as for the purpose of, quote, adjusting U.S. procedures to the requirements of foreign practice and procedure. And with respect to the question presented in this case, there are three salient, completely undisputed facts. Number one, EC law denies an antitrust complainant any discovery rights for anything at any stage of the proceeding however long or short it may go. Number two, if AMD had filed its complaint with the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department or the FTC, it would likewise have no discovery rights whatsoever. And third, the EC, which can obtain these documents directly from Intel, has not only declined to do so in this case, but has unequivocally represented to this Court that permitting parties that file complaints with it, thereby to invoke section 1782, will interfere with its governmental functions.",
  "Justice --",
  "Well, we -- we think --",
  "Yes.",
  "Everybody will come -- everybody who argues today will give you some definition of what interested person is, and none of them are the limits of definitional possibility. So you've got to give it a construction that is consistent with the history and purpose of the statute.",
  "To be -- to be sure -- to be sure, everybody has their own favorite contextual interpretation of words like interested person or for use in. But the context of this statute is discovery, and the purpose, as made pellucidly clear, is to reduce the significance of international boundaries in discovery. And therefore, what we say, with respect, is you should read interested person to mean an entity that has at least some discovery rights to something at some stage of the process, whether it's pending or imminent or reasonably foreseeable.",
  "In -- in the foreign country, that is, for the foreign sovereign who's being assisted. Now -- now, AMD suggests that oh, no, no, no, no. Another purpose of the statute was the imperial export of, quote, liberal American discovery rules. Now, we think that's wrong, but even if it were right, it would be unavailing in this case because it is undisputed that if they had filed a complaint with any of the antitrust regulatory authorities here, they would be entitled to no discovery whatsoever. And therefore, at least you ought to interpret interested person to mean a private entity that has no discovery rights whatsoever either in the foreign proceeding or would have it here. I mean, the very premise of, quote, liberal American discovery is that it is available when a private party undertakes the obligations of being a litigant. That is, you file a -- you can't get discovery based on some speculation that you have a lawsuit. You get discovery when you undertake the obligations consistent with rule 11 of pleading a case. And what they are trying to do -- there is no case, reported case, decided by any court in the long history of this -­",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I -- I think -- I mean, I think this Court ought to announce that since the manifest purpose of the statute is to assist, quote, foreign tribunals and litigants before those tribunals, that the indeterminate words of the statute should be read in that context. But even if you wanted to say that discovery would be available at least on a discretionary basis, to someone who has some discovery rights somewhere, if they were to file this type of action in some place, that would also be useful to the lower courts. And there -- it is simply irrational to say that a statute that was enacted in order to reduce the significance of international boundaries would create this giant loophole that creates ubiquitously universally happens to bring an administrative complaint in one country and seeks to receive documents that are available in this country when he or she couldn't have received them if he had sued here and where the foreign, quote, tribunal has stated as a categorical matter that resort to section 1782 by complainants before it will affirmatively undermine its sovereign governmental processes.",
  "I believe, Justice Kennedy, that the answer to that question is no. I'm sure that Mr. Phillips, on behalf of the EC, will be able to correct me if I'm wrong. But whether it can -­",
  "Well, I'm giving him at least 15 minutes advance -- 10 minutes advance warning. The point here, I think, in response to your question, Justice Kennedy, as whether it could or couldn't is a feature of a sovereign determination by the countries that make up the European Community. If discovery is available in that proceeding, there's no doubt that's a court proceeding and that's a proceeding before a tribunal. And whatever discovery rights -­",
  "-- whatever --",
  "It -- it wouldn't at all. If it could, then, you know, a 1782 request could be made in the unlikely event that the EC or the court couldn't simply do what it can do now, which is order Intel to produce the anomalous result that they're seeking.",
  "I believe that's correct, and our -- they call -- they say that this puts them in a, quote, Catch-22 or a conundrum, but it does nothing of the sort. The question before the court of first instance may be -­ and this is assuming a lot of speculative things including, among others, that they are disappointed with what the EC does and that the EC doesn't do what it could do any day, including this afternoon, which is order Intel to produce these documents, but assuming documents aren't produced and the EC decides, as we fervently hope, not to proceed against Intel and -- and they decide that it's worth it to go to the court of first instance and the review will only be on the record that the EC compiled, under European Community law ipso facto the question would be whether or not the EC or DG comp erred in declining the request to obtain these documents. I mean, you -- we -- we don't have a proceeding -- let's say in a -- just a regular lawsuit in the United States. I'm -- you know, Intel is suing AMD. Intel wants certain discovery. AMD objects. The judge says, I'm not going to grant that discovery. I don't really think that's necessary. We don't have a procedure. You'd be laughed out of court if you came in and said, well, nonetheless, we want it produced so that if we lose before this court proceeding and we go up on appeal, we'll be able to argue not only that the district judge abused his discretion in denying discovery, but we want to be able to show what those documents would say. I mean, nobody has such a procedure. And to the extent that there's any, quote, conundrum here -- and frankly, I don't see it -- it's a conundrum that is the result of the way that the European Community has chosen to organize its processes.",
  "Well -­",
  "No. We think -­",
  "-- that insofar -- well, we think, first of all, as the EC has explained, there is no proceeding before a tribunal and there won't be unless and until one of these two parties ever decides to go to the European -­",
  "And -­",
  "Right.",
  "I think we certainly would win under it. We think on balance that when the request is made by a private party, not a foreign sovereign or tribunal, that the request should be made by somebody who is a litigant in pending litigation but that at the most, if the court were to say, well, okay, even in the context in which there is a private who's not even a litigant yet, we're going to allow discovery to be obtained where litigation is, as the Second Circuit has said, imminent, that is, reasonably likely to occur and reasonably soon to occur, because otherwise discovery by private parties, prior to the -- the initiation of any proceedings before a tribunal is ubiquitously unavailable unlike the context of, for example, an investigating magistrate or a criminal prosecutor where it almost always is universally available, and the 1996 amendment to the statute reflects that.",
  "None, particularly since the legislative history -- the language of the legislative history that explains the statute continues to use it, it seems to me that what they -- what they -- it most likely reflects the fact that they wanted to include the French where it was arguable whether that was or wasn't a tribunal. They wanted to -- to cover it and therefore pending wouldn't necessarily have been required in that context. But I don't think -- there is not a shred of evidence that when Congress considered this statute at any point in its legislative development, it ever considered -- and it had no reason in the cases to ever consider -­ an outlandish request where a private party that doesn't have any discovery rights at this stage anywhere in any country no matter where it files such a complaint would thereby get them as a windfall by means of this anachronism. May I reserve the balance of my time?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The brief, amicus curiae of the European Commission, states that what it wants is reversal. It wants reversal of the decision that sent this back for a discretionary, 1 of 800 judges' factor-by-factor balancing. Now, everybody considers -- Justice Souter, with respect to your question about how difficult it might be to determine foreign discoverability, everybody agrees that's a relevant factor. So the question is going to come up in even more instances if you don't announce a rule, either by construing interested person or proceeding or for use in, that somehow channels the discretion of district judges. Justice Kennedy, pages 36 and 37 and particularly footnote 18 of our blue brief provide, we think, the authority for instances. But it's basically saying the way you do when you decide cases involving discovery under rule 26. There are certain instances in which, since we know what the statute -- there's no doubt about the purpose of the statute, it will always be an abuse of discretion. Now, with respect to the question of whether this is isn't a tribunal or how soon a tribunal has to occur, AMD acquiesced, and this is a point made in footnote 2 of our reply brief on page 3. They acquiesced presented -- on the assumption, as the lower court found, that there is no proceeding before a tribunal now. Otherwise, the question of whether the D.C. Circuit's interpretation of how soon it had to be or the Second Circuit's interpretation would have been presented. Similarly, this morning is the first time that -- that AMD has argued that it was in -- that it is, in fact, a litigant. It has always argued that you shouldn't read the interested person to require litigant even in the private context because it's only in the title. It's only showered throughout the legislative history, but it's not in the text. But the question of when something is a tribunal or when it isn't may determine, as this Court's questions this morning suggest, lots of very, very fact-specific determinations that have to be examined perhaps on a case­ by-case basis, although we would argue that where the, quote, tribunal itself says we're not, a court ought to accept it. But if you simply interpret interested person or interpret for use in in the context of a request by a private party before there is any proceeding, that where the request is by an entity that has no rights of discovery at all, not to documents, not to testimony, not at the first stage, not at the second stage, and not in any subsequent judicial proceeding, we can simply cut this off. It will always be abuse of discretion to come to the United States and try and get discovery when you're trying to aid a tribunal that doesn't now and never will allow you to get any discovery.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Everyone agrees that there is some age below which juveniles can't be subjected to the death penalty. The question here is where our society's evolving standards of decency now draw that line. 15 years ago, this Court found insufficient evidence to justify a bright line at 18, but since Stanford, a consensus has evolved and new scientific evidence has emerged, and these developments change the constitutional calculus for much the same reasons the Court found compelling in Atkins.

  "It -- it certainly would be a permissible -- permissible argument. What's -- what's notable here, Justice Scalia and Mr. Chief Justice, is how robust this consensus is. We're talking not only about the whole variety of ways in which our society has concluded that 18 is the bright line between childhood and adulthood and that 18 is the line below which we preserve -- presume immaturity. But the line with respect to executions, the trend is very robust and it is very deep.",

  "My point here is that with respect to the death penalty, we have a substantial consensus within the United States, as it happens, exactly the same lineup as existed in -- as existed in -- was true in Atkins.

  "I was -- I was referring to the implication that it has often been said that because the European Union thinks something, we should, therefore, presume that the world views it that way. We're now talking about --",
  "To the contrary. My point is we are not talking about just what a particular European treaty requires. We -- the -- the eight States that -­ that theoretically -- that have statutes that theoretically permit execution of offenders under 18 are not only alone in this country, they are alone in the world. Every country in the world, including China and Nigeria and Saudi Arabia and the -- and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, every one has agreed formally and legislatively to renounce this punishment, and the only country besides the United States that has not is Somalia, which as this Court was reminded yesterday, has no organized government. It is incapable --",
  "Of course not, but this is a -­ this is a standard which -- a constitutional test that looks to evolving standards of moral decency that go to human dignity. And in that regard, it is -- it is notable that we are literally alone in the world even though 110 countries in the world permit capital punishment for one purpose -- for one crime or another, and yet every one -­ every one formally renounces it for juvenile offenders. And, Justice Kennedy, my submission isn't that that that's set -- you know, game, set, and match. It's just relevant, and I think it is relevant in terms of the existence of a consensus. There was reference made by my opponent to the fact that there are four States that set the age at 17 and four States that set the age at 16. No -- in terms of movement, no one has suggested that any of those States or any other State has ever lowered the age. In fact, if you look at those particular -- those eight States, a number of them legislated an age that represented raising the number over what had previously been permitted. The movement, as this Court addressed, talked about in Atkins, has all been in one direction, and it's not as if that movement, in and of itself, answers the question. But where you have the type of consensus that exists here, as it did in Atkins, and where you have a scientific community that in Stanford was absent -- the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the major medical and scientific associations, were not able in 1989, based on the evidence, to come to this Court and say there is scientific, empirical validation for requiring that the line be set at 18.",
  "Well --",
  "No, no, no. I don't -- I think it's -- it may be in small part to that, Justice Kennedy, but I think the main point is that what their brief looked to -- what the argument was was our -- are adolescents cognitively different than adults. And the answer is, as we -- our brief concedes, is generally no. And what was at issue in the abortion cases was competency to decide. And just as we allow the mentally retarded the ability to decide whether or not to obtain an abortion but not to be subject to a penalty that is reserved for the tiny fraction of murderers that are so depraved that we call them the worst of the worst, here competency to decide here, as with the mentally retarded, isn't the issue. Christopher Simmons was found, beyond a reasonable doubt, to have committed this offense with the specific intent necessary to do it, just as the mentally retarded can be. The issue in Hodgson was cognitive ability to be able to make a competent decision. And so I don't -- I didn't represent the APA then and I don't now, but I don't, with respect, think there's an inconsistency. In fact, the difference here goes to the factors that Atkins identified about why overwhelmingly the mentally retarded -- and here adolescents -- are less morally capable. They are much, much less likely to be sufficiently mature to be among the worst of the worst. And here, even more than with the mentally retarded, the few 16- and 17-year-olds who might, if we could even determine it, be -- we could determine were in fact so depraved that they were among the worst of the worst, there is no way reliably to identify them and there's no way reliably to exclude them. And it is in this respect that science I think changes. At the time of Stanford, everybody on this Court, of course, knew what all of us as adults intuitively know, which is that adolescents -- and -- and here we're talking about -- I agree that when adolescence starts and when it ends is undefined. But every scientific and medical journal and study acknowledges that 16- and 17-year-olds are the heartland. No one excludes them. And what we know from the science essentially explains and validates the consensus that society has already developed.",
  "Well, one could have said -­",
  "Justice Scalia, the number of States that engage in these executions is very small, and if it were all of the States, none of this Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence would ever have to come -- would ever have to be developed. But --",
  "Justice -- Justice Scalia, there's no doubt -- and the jury was instructed -- that age is a mitigating factor although, Justice Kennedy, in response to your question, our brief points out prosecutors, in the context of future dangerousness, which is relevant, argue it all the time and jurors intuitively think it all the time. But the fact that he could have made an individualized mitigating case or argued that he was only -- that he was young, as he did, doesn't address the constitutional problem. The constitutional problem is that overwhelmingly 16- and 17-year-olds, for reasons of the -- the developmental reasons relating to their psychosocial character --",

  "What the jury -- perhaps I'm not understanding your point.",
  "Well, the -- the -- an argument to the jury that regardless of what a psychiatrist or a psychologist would have said about Christopher Simmons, as a group, 16- and 17-year-olds have such labile personalities that it is impossible to know whether they're -- the crime that they committed reflected an enduring character is an argument that could have been made to spare this particular defendant, but it need not have been credited or given dispositive weight, particularly since at sentencing -- and this Court has acknowledged this in cases like Pate v. Robinson and Drope v. Illinois -- the jury is evaluating somebody, determining their moral blameworthiness 2 years later.",
  "Well, no. What I'm -- what I'm asking you to do -- what I'm suggesting is that the weight of scientific and medical evidence of which the Court can take judicial notice and should take judicial notice and did take judicial notice in cases like Atkins and Thompson and Stanford explains and validates the consensus that society has drawn. We're not arguing that the science or what a particular neurobiologist or developmental psychologist says dictates the line of 18. The question is we have a consensus. It's even more robust than it was in Atkins. Looking at proportionality and reliability with respect to that consensus, is there a good, objective, scientific reason to credit the line that society has drawn? And I'm suggesting two things. Number one, that although one could posit that there are 16- and 17-year- olds whose antisocial traits are characterological rather than transient, we know it is impossible -- we know this from common sense and it's been validated by science, of which the Court can take note, that it is impossible to know whether the crime that was committed by a 16- or 17­ year-old is a reflection of his true, enduring character or whether it's a manifestation of traits that are exhibited during adolescence. And -­",
  "Here -- no. Well -- no. Here's what I would appeal to. I -- there are three relevant factors that this Court has to look at. There's the determination of consensus. Is there enough of a one or isn't there? There's the determination of proportionality, and then there's the issue identified in Lockett and in Atkins, which is how reliable is the individualized sentencing process. How reliably -- when we're talking about picking the tiny few who are the worst of the worst, how reliably can we do that? We think that with respect to each of those, we have demonstrated that the Eighth Amendment requires recognizing 18. But I will take as a posit your hypothetical question that I haven't convinced you on number one, number two, or perhaps individually on all three. This is truly a case, Justice Kennedy, in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Taken together, the fact that it's impossible for a jury to know whether the crime of an adolescent was really the feature of an enduring character, since we know, as in Atkins, that many of the characteristics that manifest themselves in mental retardation also affect the inability of adolescents to communicate with their attorneys, to express remorse, that 2 years later when this person is on trial, physically, emotionally it's not the same person that the jury is looking at and being asked to evaluate -­",
  "Well, it's -- I think it's -- it's more than that in a couple of respects. It -- it explains, corroborates, and validates what we sort of intuitively know, not just as parents but in adults that -- that -- who live in a world filled with adolescents. And -- and the very fact that science -- and I'm not just talking about social science here, but the important neurobiological science that has now shown that these adolescents are -- their character is not hard-wired. It's why, for example -- here's a -- here's an interesting and relevant scientific fact. Psychiatrists under the DSM, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which is their Bible, are precluded from making a diagnosis of antisocial personality before the age of 18 precisely because before the age of 18, personality and character are not fixed even with respect to -­",
  "We -­",
  "I think, with respect, Justice Scalia, I'm not -- I think that there is an interesting question about -- with respect to death, whether what they are and what they will become is totally irrelevant. But accepting the premise of your question, my point is that science has confirmed what we intuitively know, which is that when the jury gets around to evaluating what the character was that manifested that horrible crime, they can't tell because of the passage of age and because of a number of confounding factors and because psychologists and psychiatrists can't tell themselves whether the crime that occurred 2 years ago or 2 weeks ago was the manifestation of an enduring character or transient psychosocial traits that rage in adolescence.",
  "Only part, Mr. Chief Justice. Part of it is that the jury, of course, is looking at the defendant, and we have laid before the Court peer-reviewed scientific studies that show that they -- that people are -- frequently equate maturity and psychosocial development with race and with physical appearance. In addition, because the adolescent personality is transient and the lapse of time for trial is 2 years, in a very real sense psychosocially as opposed to -- in addition to physically, the person that the jury is judging is not the -- is not a manifestation of the person who committed the crime.",
  "Even if it were in 6 weeks, Mr. Chief Justice, we believe that the process is -- is sufficiently -- that would just make the youth the same as the mentally retarded, because the mentally retarded have stable personalities and stable characters, and yet, what this Court said in Atkins was we have two things to say. One is that overwhelmingly as a group the mentally retarded are unlikely to be among the very worst of the worst, and the very deficits that they have -- that you called deficits in reasoning, judgment, and control of their impulses, makes the jury -- the process of the jury evaluating the moral culpability, the moral blameworthiness unreliable. And it's on the basis of those two things that we think that the consensus that's otherwise reflected is validated. And here -­",
  "Well -­",
  "I -- I am also concerned about it, and I -- I have thought about this. First of all, if they are enlisted by people over the age of 18 to do that, the -- the precise degree of culpability goes to the people who are over 18, and juries ought to consider whether people who are over the age of 18 have so enlisted them. But even -- but with respect to -­",
  "Well, I think -- I think, as with the mentally retarded, or in fact, even more than with the mentally retarded, adolescents -- the -- the role of deterrence has even less to say, precisely because they weigh risks differently and they don't see the future and they are impulsive and they're subject to peer pressure. And in fact, if you look at what happened in this case, it's as good an example as any. The State says, well, okay, you know, he -- you know, this guy, according to the State's witness, the person, who was over 18 and described as the Fagin of this group of juveniles, testified to the court, well, Christopher Simmons says, let's do it because, quote, we can get away with it.",
  "Well, the 17-year-old may be the ringleader, and even if you posit that Christopher Simmons was the ringleader here, he -- he wasn't under any illusions. He wasn't making a statement about being executed. He said, we could get away with it, which speaks volumes about the -- the extent to which -- this guy was subject to life without parole, which is, Justice Scalia, fundamentally different than death. This Court has said that only when the penalty is death, do you look at the character of the defendant as opposed to the nature of the crime and the act. But the data shows -- and I think this Court has acknowledged -- it acknowledged in Thompson in any event -- that the -- that adolescents like the -- the mentally retarded are much less likely to be deterred by the prospect of an uncertain, even if probable, very substantial penalty. The -- no mature adult would have thought, as Chris Simmons reportedly said, I can get away with this because I'm 17 years old, when the mandatory punishment for him would have been life in prison. It's -- it is not -- eliminating the death penalty as an option, which is -- which is imposed so rarely as to be more freakish than the death penalty was in Furman -- three States in the last 10 years, one -­",
  "Yes, and I -- and I -- the -- the examples in the Alabama brief are horrifying. But if you look at those examples, the very first one, this is a kid who went on a killing spree, including his father, because he felt he was unjustly deprived use of the family truck. And there -- I can go through the other examples, but these are posited as people who a jury could, with a degree of reliability that the Constitution requires, say acted out of a stable, enduring character rather than transient aspects of youth? I think that's a poster child for us.",
  "Well -­",
  "May I answer? Briefly. The line -- the science shows what common sense understands which is that development is a continuum, but the line, 18, is one that has been drawn by society.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: In Hernandez v. New York, this Court explained that there are exceptional cases in which the totality of evidence surrounding jury selection is so strong that a finding of no discrimination is simply too incredible to be accepted by this Court. This is that exceptional case, a case in which even on collateral review, the sheer weight of the mutually reinforcing evidence renders objectively unreasonable the State court's conclusion that race did not motivate even one of the prosecution's peremptory strikes.",
  "I believe so. You have to find, Justice O'Connor, that race was the but-for factor or the tipping factor, not the only factor, but the but-for factor for at least one to come within the four corners of Batson. Now, I could argue I think, if I needed to in this case, that the jury shuffle evidence alone, which is an unexplained, blatantly race-based means of racially excluding jurors from the venire, comes within Batson, the Batson proscription itself, or I could argue that case too.",

That is -- that was never claimed in this case. We have, from the very --",
  "You know, I can't -- the case is called Ladd v. State. There is -- there's some -- now some reasonably substantial Law Review commentary in the State of Texas. I cited the Court to -- to one in the Houston Law Review or the Houston Bar Review when I was here last time, and there has since been one in the St. Mary's Law Review that says this is a procedure that is used to discriminate on the basis of visual preference. And what's particularly interesting about it in this case is there was a contemporaneous objection in week 2 and week 3 and week 4 that the State was doing this based on race, and the State offered no defense at the time. It offered no defense in the subsequent Batson hearing. It had no explanation before the magistrate, the district judge, the Fifth Circuit, in this Court or below, and now in this Court this time it says, well, there's this other case in which the reason given was that we didn't want to embarrass the probation officer and we didn't -- and we had people who had ties in the front row. There is no evidence whatsoever in the record that would justify those excuses here. And the evidence in the -- the only evidence in the record that seems to me compels the conclusion that this was done for the deliberate purpose of minimizing the number of African Americans on the jury. And it was done by prosecutors, each of whom -- there were two prosecutors in this case, each of whom was found to have violated Batson in criminal -- other criminal trials contemporaneous with this one. And - -",

They shuffled three times and they tried to shuffle a four times -- a fourth time because, the Court will perhaps recall -- this was discussed in the Court's last opinion -- because they waived in the fourth week. The defense shuffled -- the defense then shuffled and they tried to come in and back -- back and shuffle again when a number of African Americans were advanced in the order. There -- under this Court's Batson jurisprudence, the proscription against using peremptory strikes for a racial purpose or a gender-based purpose is proscribed to the defense, as well as the prosecution, but there -- the one doesn't excuse the other, and there has never been a claim, nor is there a factual predicate laid in this case for a claim, that Mr. Miller-El's trial lawyers were doing the same.

  "I think, if I needed to -- I mean, we -- we've argued that the shuffle, just like the race coding of the cards in the pre-Batson era, the disparate questioning on minimum punishment and the graphic script, all reinforce what we think the record shows with respect to each of the six peremptory strikes that we challenge But if we didn't have that, Justice Kennedy, I would be here arguing that if I could show a single strike that was made for the purpose of eliminating African Americans from being considered for jury service, that that ought to come within this Court's proscription of Batson. Now, we haven't made that freestanding claim because I don't think we need that freestanding claim. The jury shuffle is a practice that exists only in the State of Texas and, to my understanding, has ever existed only in the State of Texas. So it's a -- it's a very peculiar phenomenon, but I think I could make the argument that, look, even if there weren't any of these six -- let's say they shuffled it so successfully that no African Americans came up. There simply were no African Americans out of the 108 who were questioned. It seems to me that that in and of itself would violate at least a generous reading of Batson.",

I can't tell you for sure -- and I don't believe anybody can -- whether those cases were or weren't argued before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals because my understanding is -- I don't -- I have not seen the briefs that were filed in the Batson appeal, and I don't have the transcript of the argument.",

  "He certainly was.",
  "No. That was Mr. Kinne had the chickenpox, so the jury was -- the -- the voir dire took place. Mr. Macaluso and Mr. Nelson alternated the voir dire examination in the case, and those were the two prosecutors, Mr. Macaluso in the other Miller-El -- in the Chambers case and Mr. Nelson in Mrs. Miller-El's case. And interestingly, what the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals said with respect to Mr. Macaluso in the Chambers case is not only that he removed five out of five African Americans for reasons that violate Batson, but the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals also noted that he was using the same minimum punishment ploy that he used in this case in order to disqualify African American jurors. He -- the court actually goes and says, you know, with three of these people, the State tried to disqualify them by asking them an open-ended question about what they thought the minimum punishment should be even though that's usually what the defense is concerned about. Precisely what happened in this case. Now, I'm not suggesting, Justice Scalia, that our case depends upon the -- this 404(b) evidence or not, and I think it's quite --",
  "Well, I - -",
  "Justice - -",
  "Justice Scalia, a -- first of all, these -- each of these cases was tried within months of Mr. Miller-El's case, and a finding by a -- the State's highest court that a prosecutor has engaged in intentional, deliberate, race discrimination in the selection of a jury I respectfully submit -- I certainly hope is not the kind of everyday finding that is easily forgotten. But in any event, you -- yes. You have to go through all of the evidence in the case, and what the evidence in the case shows is that, first of all, as this Court observed the last time it was here, the State's proper race-neutral rationales for striking African American jurors pertains just as well to white jurors who were not challenged and who did serve. It's -- you also have to look at the race-coding of the cards, race-coding that was done by prosecutors whom this Court observed last time were trained in an office culture suffused with bias against African Americans in jury selection. And you also have to look at, with respect, the remarkable disparity in the way in which African American and white venire members were questioned, both with respect to minimum punishment - -",
  "-- and with respect to the graphic script.",
  "Well, I can't speak to other cases. But what's truly remarkable about this case -- I mean, there are many things that are truly remarkable about this case -- the State not only used this minimum punishment ploy with 90 -- 7 out of 8 of the African Americans, as opposed to only 2 out of 36 of the whites, but it actually tried to remove 2 of the African Americans in this case: Rand and Kennedy. It submitted them for cause based on their answers to those questions. And then interestingly, when that was denied and the State had to justify its -- to provide its race-neutral reasons for striking them, it didn't even mention it.",
  "Oh, I'm sorry.",
  "I -- I would defer to Ms. Bunn about that because I don't know about other cases, but - -",
  "Well, what happened in this case was there was an effort to rehabilitate. The trial judge actually became quite energetic in trying to explain to the juror that, well, it's 5 years and you're not saying that you couldn't possibly consider 5 years. But -- and that was true with respect to white jurors as well as African American jurors.",
  "I think that if I -- I believe that with respect to minimum punishment, as opposed to the graphic script, what the State is saying is last time we said there were 10 whites and 10 blacks who expressed hesitation. And this Court observed that, well, yes, but only two of the whites got it. Now, they filed a brief that says, well, the other eight were all either struck for cause or by consent. Now, that's -- that fails for at least two reasons. One, they identified 10. In this Court and below, we identified 19 jurors who absolutely expressed hesitation about the death penalty, and they have still not accounted for them. Number one. Number two, with respect to the eight who they have accounted for in their brief, the fact that at the very end of voir dire, they were struck for cause, or there was an agreement at the end of voir dire to remove them hardly provides a reason not to give the minimum punishment ploy to jurors who fit the categorization that the State has described.",
  "Well --",
  "Justice Scalia, in the context of all of this other evidence, which is the context in which you need to weigh it and determine whether we have satisfied the stringent standard for review that applies, I respectfully submit that if you go through the -- the voir dire questioning of Mr. Fields and Mr. Warren and Mr. Rand and the others that we've mentioned, and compare it, even leaving aside all of the other evidence, contemporaneous evidence, of race discrimination in the jury selection in this case, I think you will have to come to the conclusion that race was a but-for factor in these cases. In Mr. Fields -- we've -- we've mentioned him in our -- we've described him at length in our brief. This is a man whom -- I mean, forget the -- the State on its questionnaire at the time, on page 14 of the joint lodging, wrote, quote, no reservations against the death penalty. Mr. Rand, who we've compared and -- and your concurring opinion, Justice Scalia, the last time it was here said, well, yes, Rand and Mazza are very close, but it's a high burden you have to -- you have to overcome here. It's a burden we can overcome here not only because of all of this other evidence, but because of what the State wrote on the questionnaire when Mr. Rand was being examined, page 30 of the joint lodging. This is the State's notes, Quote: \"could be enforced depending on the circumstances -- Murder/robbery, type of offense -- Think proper for death penalty -- Yes, I can serve.\" This is a - - this is a venireman who said that if he were Governor, he would set the minimum punishment for murder at 99 years. Mr. Fields was --",
  "He said --",
  "I'm -- I'm not sure whether that's Rand or Warren, but I'm saying that if you compare Mr. Rand who thought that the death penalty might be applicable for all murder, who repeatedly -- in our reply brief, we include the -- the recitation -- repeatedly said over and over and over and over again that he would answer the three questions yes, depending on the evidence, without any regard for his view about the death penalty, who testified that -- I'm not saying that this is somebody whom, if this were a case in which there was nothing in this -- we were just before this Court saying there's Rand and Mazza or there's Rand and Hearn and that's enough to satisfy our burden, I would be up here arguing it but it would be a much more difficult argument. Here, those - - that comparison has to be taken in the context of not one, not two, but six jurors who are similarly situated who were treated to this questioning by people who engaged in racially disparate shuffling, racially disparate questioning --",
  "Well, I --",
  "And if this --",
  "Justice -- let me -- let me switch your metaphor a little. The problem with the State's approach to this case -- and it was the problem that -- of the Fifth Circuit's analysis -- is it is pointillistic. It is an analysis. It's like walking up close to a Seurat painting and looking at each dot and saying, well, it's red, but that might not necessarily be the handbag. Yes, you have -- I mean, he had to paint with the dots, but as a reviewing court, you need to step back and look at this and ask yourself, with respect to, for example, Mr. Fields, who said not only would he have no hesitation about putting the death penalty in place, but he actually testified that he thought that in capital cases, the State was God's embodiment on earth.",
  "All in and of itself? I would say definitely not. I -- I mean - -",
  "No, I would give - -",
  "I would give you a different answer, Justice Kennedy, if it's the jury shuffle because there's no plausible explanation available on the evidence in this case. If there is a plausible explanation for disparate questioning, which there is not in the statistics in this case, I wouldn't be arguing that that in and of itself, leaving aside individual, you know, side-by-side juror comparisons, would suffice. But here, we have, in addition to the disparate questioning that is not susceptible to a race-neutral explanation -- we have things like the prosecutor's own notations in the -- in the questionnaires.",
  "Yes, Justice -- Justice Ginsburg. He -- he expressed an opinion that he thought that people could be rehabilitated, not as strong as those opinions by juror -- white Juror Hearn and white Juror Duke who sat. But in Fields' case, he was absolutely unequivocal -- I'm -- I'm referring the Court to page 185 of the joint appendix -- absolutely unequivocal that the ability or propensity for rehabilitation would not affect his willingness to -- to put in the death penalty. I believe in the dissenting and concurring opinions in this case last time with respect to Mr. Fields, it was pointed out that he was a supporter of the death penalty who could put in the death penalty. And what's interesting about Fields is if you look at the transcript pages where the prosecutor justifies the strike, on page 197 of the joint appendix, the prosecutor says, well, he was -- he -- he -- I -- he -- he said something about rehabilitation, and it goes on. And then two pages later -- they have a discussion about something -- a discussion about which questionnaires will or won't go into evidence. Two pages later, Mr. Nelson comes in and says, oh, yes, and he also had a brother who had had some involvement with law enforcement. Well, to say that that's an afterthought is really saying something. He wasn't questioned about it, as -- as neither were -- by the State, as neither were any of the four white jurors who sat who had family members who had been arrested or prosecuted. They didn't even ask these questions. May I reserve the balance of my - -",
  "Oh, absolutely.",
  "The -- the juror cards are in the joint lodging beginning on page 82, and every single card lists the gender and race, even the cards as to jurors that they never questioned. So we know that these were notations that were placed on the cards by the prosecutors at the time the venires were called. And the interesting thing about these is it's not just race and gender, it's were they fat, did they have a beard, did they have a mustache. If you map up what's noted on these cards with the Sparling training manual that said don't take minorities, don't take Jews, don't take women, don't take fat people -- people who have mustaches and beards don't make good jurors. It's - - these prosecutors were not only trained by that manual, they learned their lesson very well. May - -",
  "Well, I - -",
  "We know that - -",
  "I -- we're not here -- if this were gender or race, this Court has said that can't be the but- for reason. Mustaches, overweight, you know, go with God. May I -- may I reserve the balance of my time?",
  "Thank you.",
  "I have just three points. The Fifth Circuit had precisely the same record before it that this Court had and the State submitted very nearly precisely the same brief that it presented to the Fifth Circuit the time before. Disparate questioning on the minimum punishment ploy was objected to by the defense during the voir dire and it was acknowledged. If you look at the Batson argument, it's either Mr. Macaluso or Mr. Nelson said some of the jurors were questioned disparately, but -- and they gave the explanation that it had to do with views on the death penalty. So it was before the State courts. Now, on the graphic script, which is the disparate questioning that Ms. Bunn has focused the Court's attention on, the State now says, okay, we can't speculate about what we don't know about the questionnaires. Let's just look at the questionnaires that we do know about. Justice Stevens, it is -- you are quite right that that tells you nothing about the dozens of other white jurors whose questionnaires we don't have, but we don't need to indulge in that speculation in this case because what we know from the questionnaire answers that we have is that every black who expressed anything that could be called hesitation on their juror questionnaire, including just not filling in either question -- answering question 56 or 58, got it. Five whites who expressed hesitation did not. That is Juror Mazza, Juror Hearn, Juror Duke, Ms. Girard, who testified that she didn't -- who acknowledged in her voir dire that she hadn't filled out one of those questions which got similarly situated African American jurors the graphic script, and Juror Whaley who -- or Venireman Whaley who testified that her questionnaire expressed great hesitation about the death penalty. And what we also know is that the three jurors who got the graphic script, Troy Woods, the black juror; Mr. Gutierrez, the Hispanic juror; and Marie Sztybel, the only Jewish juror. If the Court has no further questions.",
  "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: FIFRA's preemption provision, which Congress specifically amended in 1978 to add the title uniformity, preempts by its terms, quote, requirements for labeling different from those required under FIFRA.",
  "There are -- there are two fundamental reasons. The first is that it is a principal requirement of FIFRA, and has been since 1972 and remains, that a manufacturer may only sell a registered pesticide with the precise labeling to the word and font size that EPA has approved, and that requirement applies whether the wording relates to human safety, environmental protection, or efficacy. Now, the specific amendment in 1978 was, as Mr. Frederick indicated, represented a representation by EPA to Congress -- and Congress' -- the -- the committee report plainly indicates this -- that the EPA was not saying we are no longer regulating efficacy, we are no longer concerned with efficacy. What they said was because the Department of Agriculture and the extension services and the State universities are all involved in this and, in particular, are involved in the statutory requirement that before a manufacturer can even apply for registration, even submit a registration application, the manufacturer must do extensive, rigorous efficacy testing, which Congress has indicated correctly is very expensive --",

We couldn't have with respect to at least one of those two claims. We filed a motion for summary judgment that said with respect to -- let me take design defect first. With respect to design defect, it is possible under Texas State law to state a claim for products liability under defective design without impeaching the labeling. And there is a brief filed in this case by Dean Powers, the University of Texas Law School, for the -- the Texas Chemistry Council who's an expert on Texas tort law, and he goes through the Texas torts in detail to show why they are all preempted and all invalid under independent and adequate State grounds. But what we did is we didn't move to dismiss. We filed a motion for summary judgment, and in that motion for summary judgment, we pointed the respondents in this case to this Court's decision in Celotex v. Catrett, and we said, in effect, we know that you can allege a design defect claim without impeaching the labeling, but we think that what you are complaining about does impeach the labeling. Therefore, show us what you have. Now, under rule 56, they had two alternatives. They could have filed an affidavit or a request under rule 56(f), as this Court referenced in Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, and said, hey, we don't know how this was made. We don't know how this was tested. We don't know how this was manufactured.

And what their expert said and what their response said was if the 2001 amended label had been on it, we wouldn't have been injured. Now, rule 56(c) says that when you oppose a summary judgment motion with affidavit evidence, the burden is on the adverse -- the adverse party must by affidavits, or otherwise provided in this rule, set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial, and they didn't do that.

It is an element of a -- the tort -- the claim of product defect related to warnings. And so it is not possible under Texas law, settled Texas law.

But the point about damages -- I think there are two points that are very important that not be obscured. First of all, the Government -- the fact that the Government and the petitioner can't agree on whether the statute itself provides damages relief under the principle of Bell v. Hood and Franklin v. Gwinnett County certainly shows that Congress did not speak expressly on this subject.",
  "Well, I think -- I think that -­ what the Government says in its papers is they may well be available and what Mr. Feldman -- I don't want to misquote him, but he said that under Franklin -- he agreed, I think, with what Judge Posner wrote for the Seventh Circuit, which is where no remedies -- where no specific remedies are specified -- and that's the case here -- you apply a rule of judicial implication, announced in Bell v. Hood and applied to an implied right of action in Franklin, to apply that all appropriate relief is available. And damages are the paradigm.",
  "And the irony here -­",
  "I have -- I have two different ways to get to that. First of all, section 1983, by its terms, provides redress in any appropriate cause of action. It also supplies a cause of action where no other cause of action is available, but by its express terms, it doesn't exclusively limit its remedies to causes of action that are brought under 1983.",
  "But more broadly -­",
  "That's right. It provides a -­",
  "Well, I don't, but I do know that this Court -- first of all, Congress has now enacted section 1658 which provides a -- a 4-year Federal default statute of limitations, where -- where a statute like 1983 doesn't provide it, but includes an -- an introduction that says, except where otherwise provided by Federal law. And there's certainly nothing in that language that says when you're looking at whether a statute of limitations is otherwise provided by Federal law, you look to the very statute that creates the substantive right that 1983 is enforcing. And even before that, when your -- your decision in Wilson v. Garcia made the point that when you try to figure out what statute of limitations applies to a freestanding 1983 action, there are -- there is a tripartite rule of construction that section 1988 requires you to engage in. And the first part is to see whether there is any, quote, suitable Federal statute of limitations. Now, in constitutional cases, like the one that was at issue in Wilson v. Garcia or under the Social Security Act, which is what was addressed in Maine v. Thiboutot, there were no express causes of action, much less any express statute of limitations. And so this Court said you then go to the second rule, which is what's the most appropriate State limitations, as 1988 requires.

You can't discriminate, to give Justice O'Connor's first example, among providers. The -- that was a complaint in this case. There is de novo review, it is clear, on those claims.

There is no evidence in any of the briefs on the other side or any of their amici that there has either been a flood of litigation or inappropriately large awards.

What it wanted to do what was this -- the point this Court the addressed in -- in Stakura and -- and Owens v. City of Indianapolis, which is to enforce a Federal statute through privately enforceable Federal rights, which would include a damages remedy that both provides a deterrent against conduct that had provided entrenched resistance to a Federal program and provide compensation where reasonable and appropriate.

  "First of all, Justice Ginsburg, I -- the reference to those two Senators -- what those two Senators were talking about is not, as my colleague's brief suggests, this provision. They were talking about another provision of the Telecom Act. I think it was section 253, but I may be wrong. But even if that's the case, the fact of the matter is that whether it was going to cost them -- I agree. It would cost -- look, a regime in -- which left all of these siting decisions to the FCC is breathtaking, and it certainly would impose lots of costs not only on local municipalities to have to come to Washington to justify these decisions, but certainly on the FCC, which would have to send an army out to example -- I mean, it would sort of like be the -- the television commercial, you know, where the guy is walking around saying, you know, can you hear me now, can you hear me now? The fact is it made great sense to continue to leave the initial decisions with local authorities. But Congress had -- was frustrated, expressly frustrated with the fact that the prior regime, in which they had let local authorities do it under their normal routines and applying the normal remedies, was not getting the job done. That was the imperative of this statute. And in the -- in the absence of any evidence, even now 11 years later -- or I guess it's 10 years -- 9 years later. In the absence of any evidence of a flood of litigation or inappropriate awards, I think given the very heavy presumption that this Court has recognized over and over and over again, that 1983 is there.",

It's -- I'm not suggesting that -- that Congress had damages in mind specifically and only to deter conduct. You have said in a variety of instances -- I mentioned Stacura in particular -- that 1983 damages do serve as a deterrent to violation of Federal rights by municipal local officials.

  "Well -­",
  "Justice Scalia, the -- the -- 1983 -- and your jurisprudence shouts this as clearly as it does any other principle -- stands for the proposition that it's there unless, in the explicit language of the statute that creates the right, there is a demonstrated incompatibility. And that's the background rule. There are many instances in the Telecom Act and elsewhere in which Congress has said you can only get injunctive relief. You may not get 1983 damages. I mean, go back to Adickes v. Kress where this Court said in title II of the Public Accommodations Act, Congress expressly -­ expressly precluded damages in order to avoid invocation of 1983. And I'm not saying that Congress had in mind my client, who is an individual, a sole entrepreneur, who was subject to, I think what the record shows is, prolonged and entrenched intransigence by this particular municipality, any more than it had Judge Posner's example in the Seventh Circuit where it was, you know, Verizon v. the Village of Mequon. But this Court has recognized, as have the lower courts, that you only get damages if you prove that you really have been damaged. And in an instance where there's some procedural violation and a remand to correct it, this may very well be the instance of Carey v. Piphus, where the damages are purely nominal. The agency is given the opportunity. In this case, the city never said, give us the opportunity to go back and correct it. And Judge Wilson, a very level-headed district judge, said there's nothing to go back and correct because the only thing -- the only reason that the city gave was it didn't like this antenna and tower in the first place. It -- we concede that it makes no difference to anybody which frequencies are being broadcast from this tower that we approved 10 years ago and have no right to modify. And therefore, there was a substantive violation, not just, you know, you -- you may have had substantial evidence but you didn't lay it all out or you gave your reasons at length and orally but not in writing, I'll give you the opportunity to go back. There's a line of cases this Court has decided under the Social Security Act where there have been remands to correct procedural errors or small errors, and in those instances, Carey v. Piphus says you don't get damages. And under Buckhannon and Farrar v. Hobby, you probably don't get attorney's fees either.

  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The respondents had a full and fair opportunity to litigate every issue relevant to their Federal claims. When they came to Federal court, they agreed that, with one exception, all of the relevant issues, both the ultimate issue of a reasonable relationship and all of the predicate issues that we recited, as Justice Ginsburg noted, at pages 10 and at 11 of our brief, had already been litigated. They said that they -- there was one difference, which is that they claimed that under the Fifth Amendment, the level of scrutiny under a substantially advances claim, which is what they were litigating, was the Nollan/Dolan test of rough proportionality, not the more deferential standard of review that the California Supreme Court applied in its decision. And as to that issue, they received a full litigation and adjudication on the merits in the courts below. They petitioned this Court on that substantive question.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, here I was referring to the district court and the Ninth Circuit following the California Supreme Court's decision. They came to the courts and said there's one thing that's different. There's one element that's different, and that is Nollan and Dolan. Heightened scrutiny should apply to a financial exaction of this sort. The California Supreme Court disagreed under California law. We want to litigate that issue here, and they did. The district court ruled against them on the merits. The Ninth Circuit ruled against them on the merits. They petitioned this Court in question 2. This Court denied review. In all other respects, their claims -- their case under their Federal claims, which were not claim- precluded, were, as the district court found, quote, based on the exact same facts and circumstances argued before the State courts. Now, they -- their case here boils down -- and it's quite clear from their reply brief, and Mr. Utrecht has reaffirmed it -- to an argument that this Court's 1963 decision in England ought to be extended to the Williamson County context. Now, I believe that England is distinguishable -- highly distinguishable from the facts or the circumstances of a Williamson County remand for any number of reasons that I can explain. But ultimately my point is this. England is fatal to them. If England were extended to this circumstance, they would lose, and that is because in England, the Court was entirely clear that as to the State law issue that the Supreme Court said should be presented to the Louisiana courts first for determination, there was no doubt that issue preclusion was going to apply to that. The question was whether or not principles of preclusion would bar them from coming back to Federal court otherwise. In other words, in England, the question -­ there was a challenge by chiropractors to a State law that said chiropractors have to go to medical school or something like that. A Federal complaint was raised under 1983, saying that violates our Fourteenth Amendment rights. That's wrong. The Supreme Court said, well, wait a minute. We're not sure that the Louisiana law covers chiropractors, and if it doesn't, we can avoid the Federal constitutional question. So we're going to, in effect, certify to the Louisiana courts the question, the State law question, whether chiropractors are covered. Now -­",
  "No. They used -- they -- they abstained under the Pullman doctrine which, as this Court has explained, is a procedure that is akin to the certification process where States use it. But in any event, no one -- when -- no one would have thought for a moment that having gone to litigate that State law issue in State court, if they had lost, England -- the chiropractors could come back and say, okay, we think that we shouldn't have to comply with this law for two reasons: one, because we're not covered by the law even though the Louisiana courts thought so; and two, if we were, the Fourteenth Amendment would prohibit it. They -- the question on which you granted review is limited to those issues, and there is a fair question on the record in this case whether any of those issues are really before the Court now. But as to those issues, for which Williamson County requires that a party resort first to State procedures, whether issue preclusion applies, and the -- the extension of England by analogy to this would dictate the answer yes. It may not apply if -- if you extend England to all other types of issues that a party may litigate along with their Williamson County ripening exercise. But the very determination that Federal law requires them to obtain under State law, prior to stating a ripe Federal constitutional claim, of course, gets issue preclusion. Now, the question was asked -­",

  "Let me explain why I think it would be imprudent for the Court to resolve it and then explain why I think it's fair to say that the Court didn't consider one way or the other principles of preclusion in application of the Full Faith and Credit Act in Williamson County.",
  "Well, I think it would be imprudent to decide -- I -- I think that the Court will have to elaborate on the Williamson County requirement and how the procedures work. I hope, after all the preparation for this argument, I'll be able to participate in some way in that debate because it's a really interesting question. But it's not presented here because even if you were to reconsider Williamson County, even if you were to overrule it, it wouldn't affect the outcome here.

  "Which would be California. And I do think, with respect, Mr. Chief Justice, that the California Supreme Court -- I'm sorry -- the Ninth Circuit made clear that it was applying California preclusion law. It cited the California Supreme -- a -- California authorities, and it correctly recited the elements of the California preclusion law in this regard. It did make reference to its prior determination in Dodd v. Hood River, which was an Oregon case, in which the Ninth Circuit decided that an England reservation in the Williamson County context was effective with respect to claim preclusion but not issue preclusion. And in that respect -- and this I think goes back to Justice O'Connor's question about, you know, what -- what could we have been thinking or not thinking in Williamson County -­ the -- the Dodd case provides a pretty good example. At the time this Court decided Williamson County, many, probably most States did not have a substantive takings jurisprudence that was akin to the Federal standard. For example, California itself, New York didn't provide compensation for regulatory takings at all. In those States, there would be no question of either claim or issue preclusion because in the course of deciding whether or not compensation was due under State law, there would be few, if any, common issues decided. Now, as the Ninth Circuit explained in Dodd v. Hood River, Oregon recognizes -- in the context of regulatory takings, recognizes an Agins type claim, that is where you are completely denied all economic value to your -- I'm sorry -- a Lucas claim, but they don't recognize the Penn Central standard. They don't provide compensation unless you are denied all economic value.",
  "Issue preclusion or claim preclusion?",
  "I think the answer is there -- if England -- if the England decision were extended to the Williamson County context, there would not be claim preclusion. We think it shouldn't be extended, and therefore if they litigated both their State claim and their Federal claim in State court, we think they would be barred both by issue and claim preclusion.",
  "I -- I don't -- I don't think so, Justice Scalia. I think it was certainly open to them and the -- the Ninth Circuit, in its first opinion, made clear that it was open to them, when they went -- when they did their Williamson County ripening, to also litigate the Federal constitutional question. And in that instance, if they lost in the California courts, of course, they could have petitioned. They couldn't -- if they lost on the State constitution, the court would have had to reach the Federal constitutional question as well. But I think, Justice Scalia, more to your point about what actually happened here, I think that a very good argument -- I -- I don't think that there's really much doubt that if they had petitioned for certiorari from the California Supreme Court decision, you could easily have granted review under Zacchini and Michigan v. Long and Ruiz because the California Supreme Court said, to be sure we are deciding only the State constitutional question. We are not ruling on the Fifth Amendment. But they made very clear that, whatever congruent means -­ they made very clear that they looked to this Court's statements and expositions about the meaning of the Fifth Amendment to construe the claims the same. And as this Court said in Ohio v. Reiner, I think 2 years ago, when a State court's interpretation of State law has been influenced by an accompanying interpretation of Federal law, we may review. And in fact, if you think about it, think of almost every takings case that you've decided since Williamson County. With the exception of the Tahoe compact cases, they are all from State court decisions. Lucas, Palazzolo, First English, Nolan and Dollan, Yee, Pennell, McDonald, San Diego, they are all -­",
  "Yes, because that was a case -- that's the other one that I was thinking of this morning. That was a case that was filed in the district court and litigated in the district court. And it raises a real anomaly about whether or not this case even really presents the question on which you granted review because their -- the theory that they have pursued in State court and at this round in Federal court is that there is a takings violation under both the State and the Federal Constitution under the so-called substantially advances prong. Their complaints allege a Penn Central violation, but their briefs in the lower court -- in the lower Federal courts in this proceeding and in the State courts don't discuss Penn Central at all, as the California Supreme Court in footnote 14 of its opinion explained. So if this is just a substantially advances claim, it raises the question, number one, whether in the context of legislation, there is a substantially advances prong in the Fifth Amendment, a question that you're -- you're asked -- that you are presumably addressing in Lingle v. Chevron. If there is, it raises the separate question posed by this Court's decision in Yee whether that is a claim for compensation. In other words, what this Court said in Yee is when you challenge, under the Fifth Amendment, legislation on the grounds that it doesn't substantially advance a legitimate government objective, this Court said, that's not a claim for compensation. That is a claim that the ordinance be struck down and not applied. And that's what they're litigating here. Now, they have -- and so the question is if it's not a claim for compensation, is it subject to Williamson County ripening? Why should you have to go to State court? So there are a lot of this -- the Conference of State Chief Justices have filed an amicus brief in support actually of us in this case, saying we don't see that the facts of this case present the question on which you granted review. I think it's fairer to say it's not clear because the petitioners did challenge this ordinance not only on its face, but as applied. And although the district court below found that it wasn't a real as- applied challenge because they couldn't in any meaningful way distinguish themselves from the other 500 residential hotels in San Francisco, all of whom are concededly subject to the hotel conversion ordinance. At least I suppose in theory, there is some claim for compensation for the temporary period in which they were subject to the hotel conversion ordinance. So I -- I don't know. I -- you granted cert in the case. We'd like to get the -- the question answered, but I think the reason this long disquisition, Justice Kennedy, about Del Monte Dunes is in Del Monte Dunes, it was a substantially advance claim, and I think it was thought that there was no need to engage in Williamson County ripening.",
  "At most -- I mean, they could certainly make the argument. At most, preclusion would give way on the ultimate Lucas question, not all of the subsidiary issues that were resolved en route to that determination, issues akin to the ones that we recited at pages 10 and 11 of our brief. That is, if the district -­ if the State court finds, you know, that the property is in such and such a place and on such and such a year, this thing happened or that the ordinance, as it applied, had this effect or that effect, there certainly would be no possible argument that issue preclusion wouldn't apply because they -- those were necessary determinations and they had a full and fair opportunity to determine it. As to the ultimate issue, this would be -- the Full Faith and Credit Act directs the Federal court to ask what would the law of California say about this. If they tried to then bring their Federal constitutional Lucas theory in State court, would issue preclusion or claim preclusion principles bar a second bite at the litigation apple? The answer ordinarily -- and you've asked me to assume that the tests that they have -- they purport to be stating the Federal standard. Ordinarily the answer would be no if the argument simply is they made a mistake. I mean, that's -- that's what happens in issue preclusion. That's what in Allen v. McCurry and -- and all of the cases in which this Court has applied full faith and credit, Kremer and -- and -- I'm forgetting the names of the other cases. The argument was, yes, they thought they were adjudicating rights under the Fourth Amendment, but they were wrong, and issue preclusion shouldn't apply. I'm -- I'm qualifying my answer a little bit because I do think that if you came to Federal court and said, look, this was a sham or they -- they -- their analysis was so skewed that it can't fairly be said that they were really applying the Federal standard, something like, you know, the -- the AEDPA standard now that -- that you get review if it's an -- not just an incorrect determination, but a wholly unreasonable application of law or fact. Then I think you would look and see, well, would a State court say, well, that's right. I mean, if your allegation is that they were so far off the reservation that it really wasn't a determination of that issue, I think you get a new review. I mean, I do think -­",
  "No, to the contrary. Not only -- there's no Pullman issue presented in this case, but the procedural posture of this case demonstrates, if anything, a full-throated appeal to the State courts. They -­",
  "There have been absolutely no such allegations made in this case. And I think a -- I think that the San Remo would have to concede that although there was a plethora of litigation in the State courts and in the lower Federal courts about the zoning determinations and whether a conditional use permit was or wasn't required, the -- the hotel conversion ordinance, the ordinance that requires the payment of this in lieu fee, applies across the board to all residential hotels based -- wherever they're located in the city, whether they're in a historic district or not and whether they have to be rezoned or not. It was a simple, straightforward question about whether an ordinance that says if you run a residential hotel or you have residential rooms that you have certified as of the date the ordinance was enacted and you want to change them permanently to full-time tourist use, you have to bring an equivalent number of units on line or you have to pay an in lieu fee to the city's building fund. And they made a challenge, like many people have, that substantively that violates the Federal and State takings clause. That is a taking of private property without just compensation. But it applies to all the residential hotels in the city wherever they're located, regardless of whether they need variances or -­ or anything like that. Now, in this case they went first to the Superior Court in San Francisco and they filed an administrative mandamus claim challenging the zoning determination that was made in their case because they're in a historic district. And at the same time, they went to the Federal court and they raised all of their takings claims with respect to the ordinance and the zoning issues. They got a preliminary injunction in Federal court which was then -- but then lost a summary -- they had summary judgment issued against them on all the substantive -- all the claims in their case. When they came to the Ninth Circuit, they asked the Ninth Circuit to abstain under Pullman because they had this municipal law question pending in the superior court. It had been pending for 5 years, and that might somehow obviate or change the constitutional question. And they then went to -- they -- the -- the Ninth Circuit noted that it was rather unusual for the plaintiff to be invoking Pullman abstention and certainly to be doing so for the first time on appeal after losing in the district court, but nonetheless, the Ninth Circuit said fine. And they then went to State court, and they pressed not only their pending municipal law question, but they also made their takings claims under Penn Central and under the substantially advance prong both as applied and both facial under the State constitution. And they received a full and fair hearing on those claims in the superior court, in the court of appeal where they won, and in the California Supreme Court where they ultimately lost 4 to 3. There -- I don't believe there is any argument made or available in this case that there was a denial of a full and fair opportunity to litigate those issues as to which preclusion is required.",
  "Well, the -- the California Supreme Court decision makes clear at page 113a of the petition appendix that it decided the takings claims, the substantially advance claims, on a demurrer and that they decided it, therefore, based on the factual allegations of the complaint, matters subject to judicial notice, of which there were many, and facts and circumstances that were not disputed. I mean, it -- there's no such thing, I don't believe, as the resolution of a legal claim in which no issues are decided. There were plenty of issues decided in this case.",
  "Well --",
  "The -- the issue of whether or not the hotel -- whether or not the -- San Francisco's hotel conversion ordinance was reasonably related to the city's objective was litigated with a vengeance. It was litigated to the point of dozens, if not hundreds of pages in the State court. The State court -- the State courts made a number of subsidiary findings leading to their conclusion that, both on its face and as applied, the hotel conversion ordinance was reasonably related to the city's legitimate objective of retaining low-cost rental housing for the elderly, the disabled, and the poor.",

So we take -- we accept as true the allegations of the complaint. Plus, we take judicial notice of all the things that the parties asked us to take notice of, which are matters of public record, of which there were many, many, many in this case, including, for example, the fact that every year from 1990 -- well, every year from the -- from 1983 on, when they took over operation of this property, they filed with the city an annual report that listed that, A, the determination that all 62 of their rooms were for residential use and then explained -- and then stated out the exact number of rooms by quarter that were, in fact, used by -- for long-term residences and those that, during the summer months, were used for tourist use. The court took judicial notice of that, as it was appropriate, en route to its decision -- this is a subsidiary issue I suppose -- that the conversion of this hotel to full-time tourist use would, in fact, cause a loss in the stock of available affordable housing. That was an issue that was determined in this case. And the ultimate question decided by the court was a mixed question. It was the application of law to fact, as this Court explained, I think in Yee, is characteristic of substantially advances claims. Thank you very much.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I -- I can anticipate at least one question. Let me just say at the outset --",
  "-- that long, perhaps centuries, before Justice Story ever wrote his commentaries on equity, it has been firmly, unequivocally established that a final judgment, not -- we're not talking about an interlocutory order, but a final judgment of patent infringement yields an injunction in all but the very rare case. And that settled regime is not an exception application of those principles. Equity, as this Court has reminded us over Amoco cases -- equity first takes account of the nature of both the right at stake and the violation. And because the only right that a patent provides under U.S. law is a limited-term right to exclude others from practicing the invention, infringement produces an injury that is both, A, irreparable by its nature and, B, continuing in the nature of a continuing trespass to chattels. And under traditional equity principles, a showing of either of those things, either irreparable injury or a continuing harm, warrants an injunction in the owner's favor unless the offending party can marshal very strong equities otherwise. That is the settled rule. Now, no such showing could be made in this case. The jury found, by clear and convincing evidence, that eBay had willfully infringed the '265 patent, that it knew about it, and it had no good faith belief either that the patent was invalid or that it was not infringing. The jury was told that if it found either of those things, it could not find willfulness, and it found willfulness by clear and convincing",
  "The -- what we know is that -- that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice, with the following clarification, that the office action, as Mr. Minear has indicated, represents a -- an initial judgment by a staff member in the office. And what -- what is quite -- and it is -- doesn't represent even the PTO's final judgment in the case, but what is really revealing here is that reexamination is a process that was invoked by eBay. And as we point out in our brief, typically if a competitor is concerned or doubts the validity of a patent, it will invoke reexamination, ask the PTO to reexamine it when it first learns about it. eBay not only didn't invoke reexamination, it cited the '265 patent at least 24 times years before. It then came to MercExchange and offered to buy it.",
  "I don't --",
  "I think that -- the case that the U.S. cites in its footnote is an example where reexamination processes are underway when the case is first filed or when it's pending in the district court, and the district judge certainly has the discretion to say, I don't want to get into a -- a fight here about separation of powers and Hayburns case. Let's let the reexam proceed, and then we'll have a trial. In this case, eBay waited not only until it was sued and not only until it was found to have willfully infringed this patent, but in the middle of the appeals process. It then comes running in and a rule that would allow a district judge now to give notice of that in denying an injunction would basically be a -- an open invitation for everybody to go ahead and try and win at trial, go through the whole multi - year process, and if you don't, just put it into reexam. This -- although the reexamination is required to be -- is required to proceed with, quote, special dispatch under the statute, this reexamination of the office and we still don't have a final action. So we think, in the circumstances of this consider reexam because eBay hadn't invoked reexam at the time, it would be an abuse of discretion for the court to either refuse an injunction or stay it in light of the fact that it's now proceeding. But that's not an issue for this Court. It wasn't an issue for the court of appeals because it wasn't part of the district judge's analysis of the requisite equitable factors. And what -- if I can just get back to the facts of this particular case and then talk about the law. The finding of eBay's willfulness in this case disables eBay from invoking the relative balance of harms. We certainly agree --",
  "Well --",
  "Justice --",
  "I've been asked to couple so many things together, I may forget some of the coupling. Please -- I mean this in seriousness. Please remind me because there is a very good answer in law and on the record to each of your points.",

  "That's --",
  "In the case of a nonwillful infringer, a court in --",
  "The -- the invention is a -- it's -- it's not a business method. It doesn't claim methods. It claims a system, an apparatus for an electric market for the sale of goods via a network.",

  "Well --",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, if it turns out that it's too hard and -- and the -- and a specific injunction can't be written, rule 65(d) requires that an injunction not issue. And in fact, as we've cited in pages 17 and 18 and, I think, 19 of our brief, the Federal Circuit has, in fact, overruled injunctions that were insufficiently precise to satisfy rule 65. But the claim of imprecision here is -- look, I'm not a software developer and I have reason to believe that neither is Your Honor, and I -- I can't -- this claims. It's laid out very carefully in --",
  "Well --",
  "I'll say respectfully that that is not a fair characterization of the innovation here, the actual innovation. But let me just say, for purposes of this case, there is no challenge continuing to the validity of this patent. It was challenged before the district court and on appeal on grounds of an inadequate written description, et cetera, et cetera, and upheld. There was a Markman hearing in which the district court construed the patent, added certain claim limitation terms that eBay wanted and we thought were not fairly in it. But significantly, there was never -- never -- a claim to the judge -- and this is an issue for the judge under section 112, paragraph 2 -- of -- of invalidity for indefiniteness.",
  "The patent office -- none of the have been rejected, as I understand it, certainly in this patent, for obviousness under prior art, which is all the same prior art that was presented to an Article III court here and that a jury entered a finding on. There are a host of questions that undoubtedly will be presented in the case, if it ever happens, in which a final -- Patent and Trademark Office, on the validity of a patent, contravenes something that a -- a final judgment of an Article III court. But that's not this case. And we certainly agree with the United States that when -- if the judgment is affirmed, the case will go back and the district court will then have to address a point it hasn't addressed yet, which is is the -- is the -- the permanent injunction proposed by MercExchange adequate or inadequate and how can it be made specific, and this supposed work-around -- does it or doesn't it violate the terms of the injunction. I mean, the district judge actually found bad faith -- this is page, I think, 71 of the petition appendix -- of eBay in its conduct in the district court of that for $8,000, they could work around or design around this problem and there wouldn't be an -- they certainly didn't appear to have done it in the Federal Circuit because their brief in the Federal Circuit never mentions it, and the Federal Circuit opinion surely would have said, they've designed around this problem and, you know, therefore this, that, or the other. Even in this Court, eBay has said in its -- in its opening brief at page 43, here there is a possibility that the infringer can develop a work- around. Well --",
  "You couldn't just say don't infringe anymore because rule 65(d) requires specificity and precision. Ordinarily what happens in these cases is there's -- you know, there's usually been a claimed -- a detailed, claimed construction following a Markman hearing. There have been jury specifically describe to the jury on what basis it's to conclude who is right -- me and I -- frankly, with all the briefs we've had, I feel kind of stupid not to have thought it before. But it seems to me a great difference might turn on what exactly the injunction provided. Some injunctions must be -- might be much more burdensome than some others. If they're not all fungible, that's certainly true.",
  "Certainly not. And the terms of an injunction are appealable, and the Federal Circuit has reviewed actual terms of permanent injunctions and reversed a number of them and said this is -- this doesn't satisfy rule 65 or it doesn't meet other requirements. But in the -- in the context of this case, it is so critical that the judgment be affirmed, not vacated, because this is a real inventor. This is somebody who really did try to put it in place. This is somebody who eBay approached and then, when they didn't buy it, appropriated the technology, and the validity and infringement are final. They aren't even challenged in this Court. And any suggestion that uncertainty exists on settled law, licensing practices, and the investment- backed expectations of patent holders, large and small, in the Cooper brief filed in support of us and big, integrated companies like GE and Johnson & Johnson that have also filed on our side.",
  "These are patent portfolios --",
  "It is in the court of appeals record, but not the joint appendix. But it certainly will have to be changed because the court of appeals invalidated the '176 patent, which the jury found had been infringed, and therefore, it's -- it will need to be revisited when the case goes back for the entry of an injunction. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is properly before this Court, which should reverse under the plain language and purpose of the Organic Act of Guam. As to jurisdiction, at the time Congress amended the Organic Act to replace the certiorari jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit with direct review in this Court, the Ninth Circuit had already granted the writ of certiorari that had been timely filed and the case had been briefed, argued and submitted. The amendment said nothing about its application to pending appeals, and someone had to decide whether and how it applied to this case. The Ninth Circuit was the proper body to do that, at least in the first instance, and until it did, this case was before that Court within the meaning of Gibbs versus Wynn.",
  "It did decide it in Santos, Justice Scalia.",
  "Well, for reasons that we articulate, Your Honor, in a -- I forget the footnote number, but a footnote in our brief, there are some important distinctions, although they turned out not to be dispositive, between the nature and position of this case and Santos. But in any event, we know from the Ninth Circuit that it did not consider it otherwise, because if the Court will refer to I believe it's page 50a or 51a of the joint appendix, after the Court decided Santos, it sua sponte issued an order in this case -- it is on page 51a -- resubmitting this case effective February 1 to the Ninth Circuit's active consideration. And shortly thereafter, it filed the order in this case from that -- in our view, triggered the 2101(c) 90-day period.",
  "Well, I wouldn't have the most, the strongest argument that I have in this case. I think -- now, the Court's cases are not clear here but it does seem to me that in the instance as here, where it isn't just that a party has made some application or filed a cert petition with a court, but the court has actually reached out and asserted jurisdiction, surely anything other than an amendment withdrawing -- that an active withdrawing -- withdrawing jurisdiction that requires anything other than merely a ministerial act, where there can be no possible confusion about what Congress intended to do, certainly anything short of that, it lies with the Court to ascertain it. And here --",
  "I actually would not embrace that test. I think that in an instance, Your Honor, where a court in which, properly had jurisdiction and affirmatively asserted it and issued -- and I can take the Court through this -- a series of orders of the Court, following this 19, the October 19, 2004 enactment leading up to the decision in Santos and thereafter, which the Court continued to rule, continued to issue orders in this case, I think a good argument can be made that on a theory of constitutional avoidance the court ought to construe any enactment of Congress, no matter how pellucid it is, as not constituting a self-effecting reversal of a preexisting order of the Court in which the case had been pending per order of the Court. And so I'm not sure that I would even embrace a ministerial test concept in the context in which a case is properly pending in front of a court which has affirmatively asserted jurisdiction over it. And indeed here - -",
  "Yes. Yes, Your Honor. And I think you should -- well, I suppose you could start anywhere. But let's, maybe it would be as well to start on 49a of the joint appendix. In December 15 - - remember, the Guam Organic Act was amended I believe October 30, 19 -- or 2004, and it was silent as to its effect on cases that had already been filed and were pending in the Ninth Circuit. Sua sponte, the Court -- well, actually it was not sua sponte. Almost two months after Congress enacted the Organic Act, the respondent in this case, Governor Camacho filed a motion on December 8 with the Court renewing a previous motion for the Court to expedite its resolution in this case. And Governor Camacho's affidavit in support of that motion is included in the joint appendix. In response to the motion, not telling the Court hey, by the way, it's been nice doing business with you but we have no further truck with your court because Congress passed the statute and you are ipso facto by operation of law no longer in business, the Ninth Circuit issued the order on page 49a that says no opinion in this case can issue until the case of Santos is decided clarifying our continuing certiorari jurisdiction over decisions from the Guam Supreme Court. Then turn to page 50a of the joint appendix. A week later, on December 22, the Court sua sponte issues an order withdrawing and deferring a ruling in this case pending the decision in Santos. Santos is then decided in January. And on February 1, the Court issues an order in this pending case saying okay, it's resubmitted to the panel. And shortly thereafter, the panel issued the order dismissing this case for lack of jurisdiction, and from that date we filed a timely petition for certiorari. Now the contention of the respondent in this case that the attorney general should immediately upon enactment of the Organic Act amendment have also filed a petition with this Court would do one of two things. It either would have put this Court in the position of determining the effect of the amendment at the very same time that the Ninth Circuit was doing so, which is a state of affairs that this Court has repeatedly rejected, most notably in Andrews versus Virginia Railway, or it would have amounted to nothing more than what this Court has called, quote, \"the filing of a redundant slip of paper.\"",
  "The attorney -- there were two cases in which the Guam Supreme Court issued a final - - its own final ruling after the October 30, 2004 amendment of the Organic Act. And in that instance, the Organic Act was in effect. He filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in this Court. There were two cases that were pending in the Ninth Circuit and over which the Ninth Circuit had granted the writ, this case and Santos. In Santos, but not in this case, the Court asked the parties to file supplemental briefs with respect to the Court's continued jurisdiction, and the attorney general did so in this case, and it's discussed in our reply brief.",
  "Well, the attorney general could have filed a petition for writ of certiorari before judgment in this Court, you know, at any time prior to the time that the Ninth Circuit issued its order dismissing jurisdiction. This Court has said uniformly outside the special context of three-judge courts that it will not require the mere filing of a redundant piece of paper, to quote the Colville Indian Reservation case, and it has declined to extend this well, why don't you just file a notice of appeal.",
  "Yes. But that is actually what this Court was referring to in the Colville Indian Reservation case and other cases in calling it redundant in the sense that it was identical or effectively identical to a piece of paper that had invoked the jurisdiction of another court at the same time. In the three-judge court context, Justice Ginsburg, although this Court's jurisdiction to hear direct appeals in three-judge courts has been greatly reduced since the 1950s and sixties and early seventies, there are certain instances that this Court has realized where it is unclear whether an appeal lies to a regional court of appeals or to this Court and it is unavoidable there that you would file a notice of appeal in both instances; but this is not a situation in which there was any uncertainty about where the petition for a writ of certiorari from the Guam Supreme Court's decision had to be filed. The Organic Act said the Ninth Circuit had certiorari jurisdiction. The Ninth Circuit granted the petition in this case and had assumed authority over it, and so - -",
  "Right.",
  "Yes, and in fact -- I mean, it's -- I don't think that anything actually turns on this in the context of this case, but it is quite significant that at the time -- there has yet never been any appellate determination of the substantive question in this case. The Guam Supreme Court considered this as a court of first instance that original petition was filed in the Guam Supreme Court. And the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals at the time that the attorney general filed the petition for a writ of certiorari was the only place the attorney general of Guam could go to get review of this construction by a territorial court sitting as a trial court in the first instance of an act of Congress.",
  "It would be exactly the same. We just think that, given the fact that this is an instance in which the Ninth Circuit granted the writ of certiorari and issued both before -- both before the amendment and after the amendment and both before Santos and after Santos orders reflecting the fact that it believed it continued to have authority over this case, the appropriate outcome in this case is more straightforward than it might be in some other closer instances.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Yes, Justice Ginsburg, we do. I have spoken personally and repeatedly with the attorney general, who is with me at counsel table, who has instructed me unequivocally to continue vigorously to advocate the construction of the Organic Act that reflected in our petition and in our merits and reply brief.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, this is actually an a fortiori. If you don't agree with me and you think that there really wasn't a case or controversy, then we would respectfully submit the appropriate resolution would be to dismiss and vacate the Guam Supreme Court's decision so that the attorney general - -",
  "Indeed. But here's the situation here, and this is why I think it's an a fortiori case. The attorney general and the governor of Guam are each separately elected. They each have non-discretionary obligations under Guam law in addition to their obligation to interpret and enforce the Constitution and laws of the United States. The attorney general cannot be removed by, by the governor, by Guam law, unlike the case in many of these Federal executive branch intramural disputes; and she is required by Guam law in any instance in which the governor and the legislature attempt to borrow money subject to the full faith and credit of the territory to certify that such borrowing is lawful. And in this instance, therefore, she is, as the unremovable elected chief law enforcement of the territory, she is required both to properly apply the Federal law that, the Organic Act that constitutes Guam's constitution and Guam territorial law which requires her affirmatively to certify the legality of the proposed buy-in.",
  "Justice Scalia - -",
  "There may very -- it may very well occur. In fact, there either is or imminently will be a proposed additional borrowing of $123 million proposed by the governor to the legislature, and that is going to require this attorney general to ascertain, presumably prior to the time this Court -- well, I won't presume, but perhaps before this Court renders a decision in this case were it to, whether she can or cannot certify that. Now, the answer to that question will turn in the first instance -- and she's not going to be reelected before then. She can't be removed by the governor before then. Her position is that if she ascertains that in the form in which it's enacted that proposed borrowing implicates, you know, constitutes debt within the meaning of section 11, she will not sign that legislation. And that, it seems to me, during the campaign -- of course, none of this is in the record - - her position was that she would continue to pursue this litigation in the Supreme Court, which is why she's here.",
  "It is her position that if she were presented tomorrow with a borrowing that would exceed the debt caps under the position of the attorney general in this case, she will not sign it because that constitutes her interpretation of the law.",
  "Correct.",
  "I think you should reach the merits of the case.",
  "Okay. I have four reasons why I think we are correct - -",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, they -- what's happening in all those jurisdictions will certainly consume at least the rest of the balance of my time. The simple answer is that -- is the following. There are - - looking first at the States, there are States that use the term \"the valuation.\" There are States that use \"the assessed valuation,\" \"aggregate assessed valuation,\" and there are a few States that use \"tax valuation.\" It is uniformly the case in the States and elsewhere that the word \"assessed\" in this context is understood to refer to the valuation against which the property tax is based, whether that happens to be a place where it is full value or a fractional value; but it is also the case that at the time that the Guam Supreme -- that the Guam Organic Act was enacted fractional valuation was a commonplace for purposes of assessing property tax. Now, in the territories - -",
  "There were three States that we discussed, Passy is one, Halsey is the other and I can't remember the name of the other one, where they used - - where the State constitution just said \"aggregate valuation\" or \"the valuation\" and the State supreme court said: There's no modifier for valuation; that must mean full value. There are, conversely, the State supreme court in Fishburn in the Illinois context and in the Indiana context where even that formulation, \"the valuation,\" the State supreme court said: Come on, it is -- the debt limitation is always calculated - -",
  "Absolutely nothing.",
  "That's -- the limit in the Organic Act, and it makes it entirely consistent with all of the other territories that I -- are not that many and I will explicate -- which is the uniform rule has been that the basis for valuation of property against which the debt limitation percentage is multiplied is the same as the valuation of property against which the property taxes apply. And in the territories the Congress has used essentially two formulations: In the Springer Act it was \"assessed value of taxable property.\" In Alaska, it was \"aggregate taxable value.\" In Guam it's \"aggregate tax valuation.\" In Hawaii, it was \"assessed value;\" in the Northern Marianas, \"aggregate assessed valuation.\" The Philippines, which you mentioned, is a particularly instructive example because in 1902 and 1905 it was \"assessed valuation,\" but then in 1916 and 1922, it was altered to be \"aggregate tax valuation.\" And then the Virgin -- Puerto Rico is \"aggregate tax valuation\" and the virgin Islands, which we've discussed, is \"aggregate assessed valuation.\" Now, the legislative histories of these provisions, including the Guam provision, are lengthy, obscure and frankly have been very difficult to obtain because in many instances the hearings are unreported. And we have been receiving the legislative history, particularly the unpublished legislative histories, of these provisions up to and including Saturday because in the 11 days over the Christmas holiday in which we did our reply brief we simply could not get hearing, transcripts of hearings that were conducted in 1949 in that Agana, Guam. But we are prepared to lodge the relevant provisions with the Court for the Court, and I don't want to, therefore don't want to make any argument about it, but I don't want to say that these words - -",
  "But the - -",
  "I think that would be hard to find out, and I don't know. I do know that there is legislative history with respect to the use of the word \"assessed\" and tax in this context both in Puerto Rico and in the Philippines. I don't know about Alaska.",
  "Correct.",
  "I'm not -- our argument is that the word \"tax valuation\" has to have meaning; and the plainest meaning is the meaning, we respectfully submit, the most natural meaning of \"tax valuation\" is the valuation that is used by Guam for the calculation of tax. And that's true not only as a matter of plain language, but for three other reasons. First of all, as I indicated, it puts Guam in harmony with the regime that has existed in every other U.S. territory in which the value of property against which the debt limitation rate is assessed is the same as the value of property against which the tax rate is assessed. And secondly, or thirdly, that fully accords with the statutory and legislative history both with respect to the territories and the states that reflects that it has always been understood that tax valuation and assessed valuation are equivalent in this context, and understanding that furthers Congress's consistent goal of restraining borrowing by territories. And finally, interpreting tax to mean full renders the word tax all but meaningless. I grant you, Justice Kennedy, that it is possible to come up with a meaning. It is not a meaning that the Guam Supreme Court adopted but it is a possible meaning; but the Guam Supreme Court interprets -- actually said in its opinion, tax has to mean something. It interpreted tax not to modify valuation, the word that follows it, but to modify the word \"property,\" and to read it as taxable property, which is with all respect plainly wrong.",
  "Okay. I don't have any such opinion letters. And I would therefore, much like to reserve at least a minute for rebuttal. But with respect - -",
  "Thank you. With respect to Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico happens to be a situation which so far as we have been able to ascertain, the law actually requires that for purposes of determining valuation for application of the tax rate, the assessed rate is required to be the actual value, as is the case in the Virgin Islands. So that distinction wouldn't exist. On the other hand, in the Philippines, it is clear from 1902 on that a system of fractional valuation was in place. Now, getting -- figuring out what actually happened in the Philippines way back when, when it was a territory of the United States, has been challenging and its may very well be that there is information; but simply, simply obtaining for example, the -- the three unpublished hearings with respect to the Virgin Islands legislation in 1949 has been actually surprisingly -- surprisingly challenging. If I may reserve the balance of my time?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I want to direct the Court -- in response to two questions that were asked of Ms. Brinkmann, I want to direct the court to two pages of the Guam Supreme Court's opinion, and I'm going to summarize them for you now, but for purposes of what's the difference between in terms of bond holders, the fact that certain property isn't taxed at all and certain property is only taxed at 35 percent, what's important to note here, and that is reflected at page 26a of the petition appendix, the tax roll on Guam includes a valuation of all nontaxable property. The Guam Supreme Court then has to go back and say, well, of this approximately 183 million is exempt. So in Guam, the tax assessor and the Guam courts are treating property that is wholly exempt from taxation the same way that it treats the two-thirds of fair market value that is exempt from application of the tax rate. Secondly, in response to Justice Kennedy's questions about why are we focusing -- why wouldn't bond holders focus on assessed valuation rather than the rest and what difference does all of this make, page 18a of the joint appendix, which is footnote 8 of the Guam Supreme Court's opinion, which comes in the -- the portion of the opinion where the court says, look, \"tax\" has to mean something; we think it means taxable property, not tax valuation. The Guam Supreme Court in its opinion in footnote 8, quoting from some language from a dissenting opinion in the Hawaii Supreme Court, says as follows, and I'm quoting from footnote 8: \"It has been argued that the use of a percentage of assessed value as a measure of the State debt limit is without significance,\" now skipping the rest of the sentence. \"The people that buy the bonds are interested in the ratio of your debt to your assessed value because, while all of the tax revenues of the State or the counties naturally are available for the payment of the debt, it's been customary for bond holders to look to the real property tax as their collateral.\" That is the authority on which the Guam Supreme Court relied and it applies to this case and it explain why the word \"assessed\" and the word \"taxable\" have been construed synonymously and interchangeably in the legislative history of these territorial statutes and why assessed value is understood to be usually fractional value for reasons of political psychology that Ms. Brinkmann addressed, but even where it's full value, it is only pursuant to a determination that for assessment purposes full value should be used.",
  "Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court. There is no question that Microsoft supplies the Windows object code, that is the precise, machine readable sequence of commands that instructs a computer's processor. From the United States, that is paragraph 7 of the stipulation. There is likewise no question that it does so with the intent that precisely the same sequence, which runs to millions of lines of binary digits, will be installed and stored -- those are Microsoft's words -- in foreign computers precisely so that they may practice AT&T's invention. Those facts resolve this case because it is thus entirely consistent with the ordinary meaning of the words of the statute to say that Microsoft has quote, \"supplied\" a quote, \"component\" that when quote, \"combined with hardware\" enables the practice of AT&T's invention. Now let's look at - -",
  "Excuse me?",
  "That's not the - -",
  "That is very different than this case because what -- first of all, we all agree that software code in and of itself, removed from a physical structure, cannot be patentable and when software -- when some -- when an invention that is practiced with software is patented, at the most what you will see is preferred embodiments of the source code which is language that humans understand and which computers do not. A lot of work has to be done in items of debugging and testing and compiling to create what is, by stipulation, at issue in this case, which is the precise, machine readable sequence that commands a computer's CPU millions of times a second. Source code would do nothing. Source code has to be worked on overseas.",
  "Well - -",
  "When you're talking -- when you're talking about sending designs over or blueprints or management instructions or a high level version of, gee let's have a code that will perform the following functions, and you have people design and make and compile and test and debug that code overseas, of course that component, the component is the object code, the precise commands that reside in the computer and continually interact with the hardware of the computer in a way I'm going to describe and is not disputed, millions of times a second. Let's take this case. Okay. Is it -- the question is, is it a component and whether what was supplied was in fact combined. That's, that's -- that's what this case boils down to. As to the component. We have something, software program, the NetMeeting and sound recorded program that can in its object, its machine readable command form, is developed, bought and sold entirely separately from any hardware that it commands.",
  "And that is what is either on the master disk or, although either side obscures this, that is what is represented in the electric - - electronic transmission, that is another means by which the code is supplied. And in paragraph 7 of the stipulation Microsoft acknowledges that it supplies the Windows object code by transmitting it to manufacturers overseas. And the way that happens is the code, the machine language, is resident in Redmond, either in the pits and lands of a CD or on the varying magnetic orientations of a hard drive, and a, some engineer from Microsoft presses a button and it is essentially, it is taken and converted into photons which stream whatever it is, 7,000 miles, under the land and under the Atlantic Ocean and emerges into a machine, a computer, a bit of otherwise inanimate parts that are sitting there in Dusseldorf, where it is loaded onto the hard drive, it's converted from photons to a series of electrical pulses.",
  "Well, I think that paragraph 7 of the stipulation, it doesn't specify one way or the other, but their case, Justice Stevens, depends upon the following. Because if I - -",
  "Let me give you two examples - -",
  "No, no, no. And it wouldn't - - what I'm saying is there is at least one violation of 271(f) here. 271(f) looks exclusively at what is done in the United States.

  "That's right.",

  "Here's the difference.",
  "And it's nicely embodied in Microsoft's reply's use, repeated use of the word \"antecedent.\" A blueprint or a design is a precursor to the actual device. It is the instructions about how to make something. It's not the thing itself. And here what we have is the object code that is the precise commands that, unlike design information, interact continuously with the hard drive and with the processor in order to make physical changes on an ongoing basis.",
  "I have to disagree, Justice Souter, because the blueprint -- the patent is not the actual series of commands that runs the machine and neither is the blueprint. The blueprint is instructions, to be sure, and it can be reflected in intangible code, but it's instructions about how to make something and once it's made it's done. You can say, as Mr. Olson did, that the design is embodied in the thing that is made. The blueprint for a semiconductor chip in some sense is always reflected in that chip. But if you don't like the chip you have to get rid of it. Software can be -- if you don't like Microsoft Word, you can download it and you can delete it and download WordPerfect and use that. And what happens in the computer -- and I think this does bear on what the nature of the component is and why in the ordinary sense of the word \"component\" and the ordinary sense of the words \"supply\" and \"combine,\" they apply naturally to what Microsoft does. I mean, is a disk, is a typewriter, is a screen, is a hard drive, is a CPU a component? Are they components when they have the code embedded in it? Of course. But that doesn't -- a tire doesn't become not a component of a car just because a tire with a wheel attached to it is also a component. The question is - -",
  "No, no, no. This is not a machine tool. The thing that was violated, the machine readable object code, is precisely what is installed on the computer and precisely what is moved from one part of the computer to another in different forms as the computer operates and it continually instructs. This is dynamic. It's not - -",
  "I don't because - -",
  "Justice Breyer, there is a long, long spectrum with respect to software that goes, goes from high level system architecture to all the way down through component architecture, pseudo code, source code, which is, which is a description that humans understand, and the actual machine language that a computer will understand. Invention -- patents do not specify machine language. The machine code is totally dependent on what type of processor it's relating to and somebody who takes source code -- I could make an argument that if you take, steal the Microsoft source code, which is the crown jewel, it is the greatest trade secret of this country, it will not be sent overseas, but if somebody took it with a bunch of smart engineers and said, you know, convert this into, convert this into something a computer will understand that will combine with a computer, that involves a question of whether what's going on overseas is manufacture as opposed to assembly. Look at it from the perspective -- maybe this helps. Let's look at the question from the perspective of Microsoft, the OEM, and the user overseas.

  "That may be. We don't - -",
  "It's one of the things that happens in this case. We have a stipulated record that is not very detailed, but in that instance there is only one violation.",
  "Well, the only -- I have two answers to that question, both of them I think directly answering your question. First of all, the statute is violated only when the precise object code is expatriated from the United States, when it is supplied from the United States. That's the violation. The other issues are damages, what damages are you entitled to. What is combined with the computer is the precise thing that is supplied because it is the precise sequence of commands.",
  "I'm not aware of any. In the lower courts, Microsoft was arguing that the biotech industry was an analogy, but there is some very obvious differences between what is supplied in terms of object code that instructs a machine and a, you know, a sequence of nucleotides, the abstract sequence of nucleotides. But I think we need to be quite precise here. We are not complaining that the component is an idea. We're not complaining -- we're not arguing that a component is some form of information. What we're saying here is -- I mean, nobody is paying billions of dollars from an idea. When the commands are loaded onto the hard drive of a computer in the form of electromagnetic orientations and when you press a button saying give me NetMeeting, and the processor says -- and this is what electrical engineers say -- fetch the instructions, fetch the commands to the random access memory where it's -- where it is there reflected in a - - in a form of patterns of electrical charges. And when the code then moves back and forth, the instructions move back and forth from the CPU and RAM, they - - they -- millions of times a second they are replicating themselves.",
  "Absolutely not.",
  "That's - -",
  "If I can, I just want to make sure I answer your question.",
  "Okay. First of all, this statute does not reach anything that is done overseas. It doesn't reach what the German OEM does. It doesn't reach what anybody does overseas. It -- it makes liable as an infringer somebody who supplies -- who is in the United States who supplies from the United States a component with the intent, with the express intent that that component be combined in a way to create a device that would practice a U.S. patent. Now I don't believe -- I firmly am confident that if you look at what's at issue in this case, there may be all sorts of questions about what is or isn't a component. I might think that a design is a component or it isn't a component, but think of these three features: One, this is something that is totally modular. It is developed, bought and sold entirely independent of any of the hardware to which it is, with which it is combined, and between which it moves continuously as it operates. Number two, it can be removed or updated entirely independently of the other components. And it is dynamic, unlike designs, unlike molds, unlike instructions about how to make something, all of which are exhausted. They have done their work when the thing is made. That's why those things are called hardware.",
  "These are instructions not about how to make something. They are instructions about what the other things that are made should do and how they do it.",
  "You could not say that because if you take the information from a golden master or a stream of photons and put it on a hard drive, unless that continues to move and change in form, the computer will not work. The computer operates by having you press a button saying do this function. The central processing unit then says where are my instructions on how to do it. It says find them and put them in random access memory, where it is then replicated in the form of patterns of electrical charges, quite a different physical form than it exists on the hard drive. And the program counter - -",
  "It's not because the blueprint has no further work to do. It was something that - -",
  "Something you teach, has no further work to do with respect to the infringing device, but the object code works continuously and gives continuous instructions to the various hardware components completely unlike. But let me go to - -",
  "Justice Souter, just taking your -- taking that as -- that as the case, the United States in footnote 2 of its brief repeats what Microsoft argued in the court of appeals and the district court, which is that if it took instead of one golden master, but 100,000 CDs, which is what a golden master is, one for each computer, that would be a 271(f) infringement. But that also requires copying and transforming the code that is on the CD-ROM which is in the form of physical pits and lands and indentations, and downloading it into the hard drive where the same exact sequence is manifested as varying orientations of electronic, electromagnetic fields, and that is no different whatsoever than this case. If you say, well, what destroys you in this case is that the code has to be copied, replication, precise instantaneous replication is simply how software works. It's not just how it's supplied. It's not just how it's combined. It's how it interacts dynamically within the computer. And that's why we say it's a component. Let me just be clear about what the statutory interpretation question here is. It's not as whether our conception of the component as the code - - as the -- as the command is better than their conception of the component as a CD or a light wave or a telephone wire that contains that. The question is, there may very -- it may very well be both things. The question is whether the word component naturally applies to what we do. And our -- we have given dozens of references to the use of intangible software, program software as components. We have given you the dictionary definition with an example from Webster's. They have not responded with one counter-example. The only dictionary example they provide you relates to the word \"such\", and it's in their reply brief on page 5. But they have given you not the first definition of such under Black, in Black's Eighth, they have given you the second one. The first one is, of this or that kind, she collects a variety of things. And that definition, under that definition it wouldn't matter whether you said, well, the component has to be physical or, you know, it could be either. Because even if it has to be physical - -",
  "I can't. And that's why it seems to me, I mean -- and there are -- there are machines that have nonphysical things in them but not that operate in the sort of same dynamic way. We gave the example of the intangible text of Moby Dick in a book. And they give the example of, you know, an incredibly complicated series of circuits on a -- on a chip. But those don't continue to operate and interact in the way that this paradigmatic component does. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. I'd like to -- I'd like to address three points that came up at the earlier part of the argument. First of all, I'd like to, I think just with respect correct a premise of one of Justice Scalia's questions. Then I would like to address the two questions that I think I heard the Chief Justice ask, which is how do we know that the this is an atypical ad, and what would the standard -- what standard would a court apply in adjudicating as-applied challenges? And then finally, assuming there's time permitting I'd like to address the question of why we shouldn't revisit McConnell which I think was posed both by the Chief Justice and by Justice Scalia. First, as to the premise, Justice Scalia, and it relates to what the predicate was of the now famous vast majority reference. I'm quoting from - - it's entirely clear from this Court's opinion and I believe it's on page 207 that the referent was issue ads. In fact, what this Court said was the precise percentage of issue ads that clearly identified a candidate and were aired during those relatively brief pre-election time spans but had no electioneering purpose is a matter of dispute between the parties and among the judges on the district court. Nevertheless, the \"vast majority\" of ads clearly had such a purpose.",
  "We think the test is whether or not it is as this Court indicated, I think, whether it's the functional equivalent of express advocacy. It doesn't use the magic words but does it have the same effect, that is, the test that this Court should -- not this Court, a district court adjudicating an as-applied challenge that is based on the content of the ad not the sort of as-applied challenge brought in MCFL or Brown versus the Socialist Workers Parties that relate to the nature of the speaker, but one that's based on the content requires the challenger to show okay, in a context of a statute that is facially valid and can constitutionally be applied to the vast majority of ads that are covered by the definition of electioneering communications, he needs to come in and show that with respect to this ad, it has characteristics such that no reasonable voter could view it as promoting, attacking, supporting or opposing a candidate.",
  "Well, you -- I think the rule is quite clear that you never do that. This strict scrutiny clearly applies here. But in the context of a -- the application of a statute that has already been upheld as facially constitutional in the vast majority of applications, the Government doesn't have the burden of reconvincing the district court the -- what the - - the very things that the Supreme Court has already decided.",
  "It - -",
  "It's -- well, we would have an awful lot of laws if everything you wrote constituted law and a holding.",
  "But that statement and a statement that follows shortly after it on the following page were essential to this Court's decision that applying the strictest possible scrutiny, this law was very narrowly tailored.",
  "I think -- well, an electioneering ad, Justice Alito, I think puts too much of a burden on it.",
  "I think that what a district court would say is could a reasonable voter in the targeted electorate have understood that this ad was in part promoting, attacking, supporting, or opposing? The, The acronym is PASO.",
  "I, I would think so. If it - -",
  "Well, it would depend, as your question suggests, on the context in which the ad is run. Now I want to make two points with respect to your inquiry. Number one, as this Court has reiterated, we're not talking about a ban here. Any one of these ads can be run so long as it is funded the same way that the election law requires them all to be funded. That is, with money that - -",
  "I -- I love it. And I'm going to give you the ACLU as an example because many -- their brief is quite powerful. They and the other amici who provide a growing table of amicus briefs every time this issue comes up, have never, ever, brought their own as-applied challenge, although those these groups are not shy to litigate when they think important rights are in effect. They have been in the three years since this Court decided McConnell, and in the year since this Court made clear what I think we had assumed, which is this statute is -- it is open season on as-applied challenges. There have been precisely two as as-applied challenges brought, both brought by the counsel in this case. The ACLU's brief which is as representative as any other says look at these ads that we've been running about really important issues: The war in Iraq, Guantanamo, etcetera, etcetera, here is the text of the ad. If we had put onto a tag line of that ad, please call Senator so and so and tell him no, we wouldn't be allowed to do it. Well, you know what? With one exception that I'll explain in a minute, in its 90-year history, the ACLU has never -- way before Bickler was passed, even outside the 60-day period, they never put that line on. And you know why? It's because they have pledged to their members and to the public that they will not engage in electioneering of any sort. They are completely nonpartisan and they don't ever want to be understood to the contrary, and so they never utter those words.",
  "Well, though, I mean, I think it does demonstrate a few things. First of all, it is entirely possible, as this Court reiterated in McConnell, for the exact same message or an equally effective message to be given at any particular time. If the ACLU or the National Rifle Association or any of the other groups that never wants to actually bring an as-applied challenge but always wants to say oh no, no, no, this is horrible, wants to run an ad, as this Court has -- they can establish a separate segregated fund. And if they come in and convince a court that that's impractical or impossible, maybe they get an as-applied challenge.",
  "I don't think anybody would claim that. Even the - -",
  "I'm not -- I wasn't -- I don't mean to pick on the ACLU. I think highly of both organizations and many of the amici that are arrayed against me. The point is that I use the ACLU as an example because the reason they never put, they never name a congressman is because they don't want their ads to be perceived as breaking faith with what they tell the public. As for the NRA, the NRA actually did bring a challenge against the FEC in the D.C. Circuit and said, \"we don't really qualify under MCFL because we take some corporate funds, but it's de minimis and we think that's what the Supreme Court had in mind. You know what? They won. But they can't take yes for an answer. They want to establish that this law is facially unconstitutional. And that does go to the point I think, if I may, as to why -- well, it -- why you shouldn't reexamine McConnell for first principles. But let me just say in response to your very first question, Mr. Chief Justice, that the reason that we know that this ad is typical is, as this Court created, articulated the paradigm of an electioneering communication, the test in the Jane Doe example, and this case is materially indistinguishable from the Jane Doe ad. That is one that, quote, \"condemns Jane Doe's record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to call Jane Doe.\" Here we've got an ad that denounced the, quote, \"group of Senators who had filibustered judicial nominees\" -- may I finish my sentence?",
  "The only thing that distinguishes that statement from Jane Doe is knowing that Senator Feingold was part of that group, and reasonable listeners in the context of the ad itself and the web site would certainly have known that. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Petitioners in these cases have three things in common. First, all have been confined at Guantanamo for almost six years, yet not one has ever had meaningful notice of the factual grounds of detention or a fair opportunity to dispute those grounds before a neutral decision-maker. Two, under the decision below, they have no prospect of getting that opportunity. And three, each maintains, as this Court explained in Rasul, that he is quote \"innocent of all wrongdoing.\" Now the government contends that these men are detainable, and the facts of these 37 cases differ, and it may well that be that an adjudicatory process that preserves the core features of common law habeas would reveal perhaps that some of these Petitioners are lawfully detainable. But limited DTA review of the structurally flawed CSRT process cannot provide any reliable examination of the Executive's asserted basis for detaining these Petitioners, let alone an adequate substitute for traditional habeas review.",
  "Well, with respect, Mr. Chief Justice, what you ruled -- as I understand what the plurality held in Hamdi was that so long as there was a process accompanying detention, that provided for meaningful notice of the factual grounds for detention, a meaningful opportunity to present evidence in response to that before a neutral tribunal with the assistance of counsel, that determination would certainly be entitled to substantial deference by a habeas court; and we don't dispute that.",
  "That's not what they got.",
  "It -- I think your decision in this case, the question -- the principal question we think is presented by the case is whether or not the DTA review of the CSRT procedures that occurred in this case adequately substitute for the writ of habeas corpus.",
  "No. The district court -- the two district judges sitting in habeas went to the merits of the case, and Judge Green did evaluate the procedures. The D.C. Circuit held that the Constitution, neither the Suspension Clause nor the Due Process Clause, applies to these people. And therefore it didn't reach the merits. But --",
  "Well, I'm not saying that this Court couldn't do that. It certainly could do that. But one of the principal -- the principal guarantee of habeas corpus through the centuries has been a speedy -- the remedy of speedy release for somebody who is unlawfully being held in executive detention. These 37 men have been held in isolation for 6 years, and it is manifest on the record in this case. There's no doubt about how the CSRT has proceeded. There is little doubt about the circumscribed nature of the D.C. Circuit's review. The D.C. Circuit has already held that the Constitution doesn't apply.",
  "Well, I want to give a qualified disagreement with your hypothetical, because it's entirely clear that, as I think members of this Court have indicated and that habeas traditionally indicates, there may be military exigencies, there may be a limited time period in which it is inappropriate for a habeas court to rule. And moreover -- if there --",
  "No, what I was referring to were sort of the hypothetical of battlefield -- somebody is captured -- you know -- and the next day or the next week from the battlefield, does he or she have the right to -- does a habeas court have constitutional jurisdiction. Putting aside-",
  "I don't think so, with respect. I think -- I don't think -- I think it is appropriate for a habeas -- if the Executive says we have detained this person, we believe this person is an enemy combatant who may be lawfully detained under the AUMF, we have an administrative process that is fair, that will -- that will determine the facts. You should stay your hand to allow that procedure to occur. Of course, that is appropriate, so long as the procedure is meaningful and speedy. That's what we do in immigration cases.",
  "I wouldn't agree with that for two reasons. First of all, I think these people are in a place that is even -- that is under even more complete control and jurisdiction of our national Executive than they would be in the Everglades, because there are no Federalism constraints here. Our national government supplies the only law. And if they were detained in Germany, the question would be A, are they being detained by the United States or by some multinational coalition force as was the case, for example, in Hirota. B, are there other laws, or can they invoke the jurisdiction of another court? And the answer to that question would depend upon the terms of our --",
  "The answer to that is a resounding yes.",
  "They are the cases that were discussed and cited by the majority opinion in Rasul, and we have -- we have added other ones to them, but it's showing --",
  "I think the opinion of two of the three law lords in the Earl of Crewe, which the majority cited as In re Sekgome. It is certain -- the government concedes it was the case in Mwenya. It was true in the Indian cases. And, in fact, as we point out --",
  "Indeed, it did.",
  "Indeed, it did, and the government --",
  "Well, no -- let me take a shot at convincing you that it's not totally irrelevant. The Crown Counsel in that case, in his brief, stated forthrightly that subjecthood or citizenship didn't matter and, in fact, in the very minority opinion that the government relies on in its brief here in Earl of Crewe, Lord Justice Kennedy specifically said that the citizenship is irrelevant. It isn't and wasn't --",
  "Well, the Court majority in Rasul cites a case involving the Isle of Jersey, the Channel Islands. None of those were within the sovereign courts' --",
  "I'll take one more chance, Justice Scalia.",
  "Okay. Here they go. In the Indian cases -- I mean, first of all, let's say that citizenship was not a notion at common law. The question was subjecthood, and subjecthood was a very ill-defined term that had no fixed parameters, as our reply brief points out. Certainly many of the petitioners in the Indian cases that we cited -- and in fact that Sir John Chambers decided -- were not Englishmen or people who would have been otherwise considered --",
  "Justice Scalia, as Lord Mansfield explained in the King v. Cowle, and both sides are citing to it -- even if the writ -- even with respect to the persons detained outside the English realm, the relevant question was, is this person under the subjection of the crown? Not what is the subjecthood or citizenship of this person? And in fact --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, let me answer that question directly and then if I may finish my answer to Justice Scalia. We don't contend that the United States exercises sovereignty over Guantanamo Bay. Our contention is that at common law, sovereignty (a) wasn't the test, as Lord Mansfield explained, and (b) wasn't a clear-cut determine -- there weren't clear-cut sovereignty lines in those days. Our case doesn't depend on sovereignty. It depends on the fact that, among other things, the United States exercises -- quote -- \"complete jurisdiction and control over this base.\" No other law applies. If our law doesn't apply, it is a law-free zone.",
  "No, I think, Justice Alito, I want to be as clear about this as I can be. This is a particularly easy straightforward case, but in another place, jurisdiction would depend on the facts and circumstances, including the nature of an agreement with the resident sovereign over who exercises control. And I want to come back to that with the Japan and German example, because I have read the status of forces agreements there. Secondly, even if there technically were jurisdiction, there might very well be justiciability issues under the circumstances of the sort that Justice Kennedy addressed in his concurrence in Rasul; that is, there may be circumstances and temporal conditions in which, under the separation of powers, it would be a -- a court would deem it inappropriate to exercise that jurisdiction. And finally, even if it were appropriate to exercise the jurisdiction, the review of a habeas court in the mine run of cases would be anything but plenary because members of enemy armed forces and enemy aliens within the meaning of the Alien Enemy Act are detainable. Period. Now, with respect to --",
  "Well, if they were in the United States, I think it's clear that they could file a habeas petition. And, you know, the question about how Guantanamo relates to that is for this Court. What's material is that -- I mean we cited to the Court the Army directives and the Army procedures implementing Article V of the Geneva Conventions that were used in Vietnam, which is the only other war we engaged in that had combatants who weren't in uniforms. They not only had a hearing that was near the time and near the place of capture and the right to call witnesses; there's no evidence that classified information was withheld from them. And they not only had a right to counsel; the government provided them counsel, somebody who was their advocate. Now, once a determination like that is made, they may -- if they're detained in the United States -- they may file a habeas petition and the response will be there is absolutely no reason not to defer to the adjudication of that tribunal. You have, as I started with the Chief Justice, you had a fair notice of the facts, a fair opportunity to challenge them with the assistance of counsel before a neutral decisionmaker.",
  "Well, I don't --",
  "You know, I think -- both sides try to derive force from the fact that such claims, such habeas petitions, haven't come forward in floods in the past. I think the reason is that, in the past, we had combat in which -- you know -- I mean in a war of the conventional sort, soldiers wear uniforms, and more to the point, the interests of the captured soldier and the command -- and the capturing officer are aligned. The captured soldier wants to be treated as a prisoner of war or released. The commanding general wants to release civilians who aren't in the Army or turn them over for criminal prosecution. That's why, in the Gulf war, there were 1200 -- roughly, just a few hundred, 1200 Article V field tribunal hearings that were held, of which almost 900 were released as civilian non-combatants and the remaining were detained --",
  "Well, first of all, there is Colepaugh --",
  "There's -- there are Colepaugh, the Tenth Circuit case and In re: Territo, both of which we discussed. But more to the point, as I said, Justice Scalia, there is no doubt that a member of the German army or somebody who is assisting the German army -- it would be totally unavailing to file a -- to file a habeas petition because they are detainable. It would be like Mr. Ludekey in the United States v. Ludekey saying --",
  "They were provided Article V tribunals that gave them actual notice of the government's facts and actual opportunity to controvert it and a determination by military officers who had not been told that both the commanding general of the southern command and the Secretary of Defense had personally reviewed the evidence and determined that these were enemy combatants; and a habeas court would simply dismiss. And a habeas court could simply say whether we do or don't technically have jurisdiction under battlefield circumstances or circumstances involving foreign detainees in a zone of occupation where active hostilities occur, it is inappropriate under the separation of powers for us to intervene. But these men have been held, taken by the United States, thousands of miles away -- in the case of my six individuals, plucked from their homes, from their wives and children in Sarajevo, detained for three months at the United States request.",
  "Well, we've asked that they be granted habeas relief. We think what that means is that they should be -- the cases should be returned to the district courts where their cases are proceeding. The government has filed its factual returns to the writ. Judge Green, in the cases pending before her, has established procedures to protect the --",
  "I would argue that the answer is no for two reasons. The one because there is no prospect, no prospect that the DTA proceedings will be conducted with alacrity or certainty; and second of all --",
  "Here's -- the -- the -- let's take the cases in front of Judge Green. Judge Leon in the cases of my client just granted the government's motion to dismiss. But in all of the cases the government has filed its factual return under the procedures, under the long-established habeas procedures under 2243. It is -- the burden is now on us. She has already ruled that with respect to secret information or classified information, here are the safeguards that will govern, here's how we will work. And it is simply on us now to adduce and present evidence to try and over -- to try to shoulder the burden we have. In the court of appeals, Justice Kennedy, the government, after two years, has not produced the record on review in a single case. It has now said -- two years. It has now said that it cannot do so, and the court of appeals has suggested that what the government ought to do is hold entirely new CSRT proceedings. Now, those proceedings are structurally flawed. Perhaps this Court could say, look, here's how it's going to be. First of all, the Constitution does apply. Second of all, we have to have a hearing in which the following things occur. We either in the Court of Appeals under the All Writs Act or under 28 USC Section 2347C -- the Petitioners have to have the right to adduce and present evidence to controvert the government's return which was -- almost all of the government's evidence was introduced ex parte, in camera, and with a -- to boot with a presumption that it is accurate and genuine.",
  "Well, I don't -- it could if the military had different procedures to govern the CSRTs. And our submission is that with respect to these Petitioners, you've asked to hold aside the six years. I would say with respect to future detainees, that this Court could issue a ruling -- well, this Court should issue a ruling saying for these people if the writ means anything, the time for experimentation is over. We have tried and true established procedures. We've got experienced district judges including a judge who was the chief judge in the FISA court, who's already established the rules for maintaining confidentiality of classified information. But we are not as a Court saying that there could not readily be an adequate substitute if the administrative procedures generated by the Department of Defense allowed for the process minimums that the Chief Justice asked me about at the beginning and advocated a standard that was authorized -- a substantive standard authorized by the AUMF. DTA review may very well be an adequate substitute.",
  "I certainly think so. But at a minimum, Justice Souter, you would have to have the kind of tribunal that is called for under the uniform code of military justice.",
  "Where you don't have the convening authority exercising command control over the tribunal officer.",
  "I don't think it is. I certainly don't think it would be unless this Court clarified under the -- I don't know whether this would fall under the guise of clarification; but specify that under the circumstances, the deferential review of the D.C. Circuit in which it presumes accurate and presumes sufficient -- adequate the evidence which the tribunal itself presumed accurate would have to fall; that is, a habeas court would never accord that presumption.",
  "Yes.",
  "I will cite two examples. I knew that there was one other thing I wanted to try on Justice Scalia. One is -- and it's referenced in our footnote -- you know, in 1777 and 1783, Parliament suspended the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus for people on the high seas or out of the realm, specifically directed at U.S. seamen, at American seamen. And if the writ never extended to American seamen on the high seas or out of the realm, there would have been no point in suspending it. Second of all, the common -- the high court judges who were administering -- issuing the writ for the benefit of detainees in India before it became a sovereign possession were not exercising a statutory authority, with all due respect to Justice Scalia. There was a royal charter that granted those judges the -- all of the common -- the authority -- common law authorities of the Queen's bench. And as the Indian case law explicates, and Sir John Chambers explains, one of those authorities was the exercise of the writ of habeas corpus, not mandamus, outside territories that were no part of the Realm of England. Those are the, I think -- I mean there may be be something in --",
  "Well, in this -- in this country, In Re Felateau, which was decided only a few years after the founding, not only was he an enemy alien; he was granted release under the writ of habeas corpus because, not being a citizen, he could not be charged with treason, which was the basis for holding him.",
  "I think in Pennsylvania. Maybe it was --",
  "It was the mid-Atlantic. Excuse me?",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, you're asking me to discard the Indian cases, and I've -- I've mentioned to you the cases that the majority of Indians in Rasul relied on, the Earl of Crewe and Mwenya. I've given you the two statutes. I think at this point I have to plead exhaustion from remedies.",
  "My -- I don't think it's in the record here, but what is in the record are the terms of the lease. And I don't really take it to be disputed that Guantanamo is under the complete, utterly exclusive, jurisdiction and control of the national government of the United States. That's in the lease, itself. The courts of Cuba have so held. They have designated Guantanamo, quote, \"foreign territory\" unless and until the United States in its sole discretion chooses to vacate the base. And --",
  "I'm not sure whether there are, or not, any longer. But unlike -- or if you take -- they are not subject -- and it has never been contended that they are subject -- to Cuban control with respect to conduct that is subject to any law of the United States.",
  "Absolutely not, and this is the key difference, I think, going to Justice Alito's question. Under our established --",
  "Well, first of all, the terms of the lease, and, second of all, I -- I don't know that we cited -- I mean, somebody has cited decisions of the Cuban Government, the judiciary and its executive, that they don't exercise any jurisdiction over --",
  "The answer is certainly yes, and if I can just make the point about bases elsewhere, in Germany and Japan, for example, the status of -- this is the only base, I believe, that -- you know, in something other than an active war zone, that isn't the subject of a status-of-forces agreement that very specifically explicates both the judicial and executive authority over acts that occur on the base. And, for example, under our status-of-forces agreement with Japan, it is entirely clear that if it is a Japanese citizen or a Japanese national or conduct that is subject to the laws of Japan, the Japanese courts have jurisdiction.",
  "Not particularly. Let's put it this way: It has not occurred to us yet.",
  "I mean, this is in -- this is in many respects a uniquely straightforward case. I really didn't mean to be facetious when I said our national control over Guantanamo is greater than it is over a place in Kentucky, because there we have -- under our system of federalism the Federal Government has limited controls.",
  "Yes. I think that's right, and I also think that, although it is correct, as Justice Scalia pointed out at the outset, that the decision in Rasul was a decision about the scope of 2241, which has now been amended, and the majority, at least, rendered a decision on the basis of the statute, nonetheless, the Court was construing 2241(c)(1), which is in haec verba with Section 14 of the 1789 act. There are other provisions of the habeas statute like the civil war provisions that -- under which this Court reviews State court convictions and detentions. But the statute that this Court was construing in Rasul was identical in language to the one promulgated in the -- the very first judiciary act of 1789, which this Court has said in Bollman was an instantiation, a positive enactment of the writ, that was protected by the Constitution. And so, while technically, the majority was issuing a statutory ruling -- and we don't contend otherwise -- inferentially, its conclusion must extend to the -- the extent of the writ at common law. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor. I want to speak mostly about the adequacy of the substitute and particularly the question that you and Justice Kennedy asked about adjudication of the standard on remand, but just to take first things first, I don't -- I don't believe I've ever seen the government's -- the case Liverridge or Green cases cited by the government before. And I don't know what they say. But it is absolutely incorrect that DTA review of the CSRTs is a liberalization of the traditional writ. As this Court made -- or the King's Bench made clear in the Bushell's case and all of the commentators including Sharpe, who both sides are citing as authoritative, here agree in cases of executive detention, where there wasn't a trial occurring, the court absolutely could -- the prisoner could controvert the facts of the return in Schiever and Spanish Citizens -- Spanish Prisoners, there wasn't an original hearing because the court issued -- sat as nisi prius court and considered affidavits of the prisoners and third parties and determined on the basis of the affidavits that they were prisoners of war. But it is absolutely clear that the writ did extend to the question of \"I am not a combatant. I am not a warrior, number one. And number two, it did go in non-criminal detentions to the underlying facts of the detention, and that goes to the point about the standard that Justice Kennedy asked and the Chief Justice asked. We agree that, if and when the D.C. Circuit ever addresses the merits of these cases, and not only is there no CSR -- complete record on return in any case, but the government has suggested they proceed five at a time, and we're now two years running without a single one -- but there's no doubt that the argument we're making in Roman numeral 2 of our brief, that the CSR, the Wolfowitz definition is not authorized detention under the AUMF, which as this Court in Hamdi said, incorporates long-established law-of-war principles and American traditions. We can raise that claim because they have to establish that the procedures and standards were consistent not only with the Constitution but also with the laws of the United States. And the problem this is this --",
  "That is absolutely correct. But what -- what habeas at its core was -- and we're talking -- I'm happy to live in the world of 1789 now -- is executive detention and not the more modern innovations where, well, certain procedures weren't constitutional or whatever, but you have no right to hold me. The facts won't allow you to hold me. The D.C. Circuit cannot --",
  "Because the D.C. Circuit -- because the D.C. Circuit is reviewing a record that was adduced ex parte, in camera, with a presumption to boot that it is -- that the evidence is both accurate and complete, and the D.C. Circuit is -- has already said it will not hear any new evidence and it must apply that same presumption that that evidence that was heard ex parte in camera with its own presumption is correct. And here's -- let me just give you an example of what difference this makes. You have the unredacted version of Judge Green's district court opinion. I don't. She discusses -- she does address the adequacy of the substitute. And she addresses the case of two individuals. One is Mr. Ait-Idir, who is my client, and you have both in her opinion and our brief this truly Kafka-esque colloquy at his hearing in which he is accused of associating with a known Al-Qaeda operative, which he denies, but he can't be told the name. Mr. Kurnaz is the other Petitioner who is discussed in her brief. He was a Petitioner in this Court, but he has since been released by the government because of the fact that he had what the CSRTs won't give him, which is a lawyer. He was told, two years after he was detained -- he's a German permanent resident -- he was told at his CSRT, as many of these individuals were not, that he was being held because he associated with a known terrorist. And he was told the name. He was told that he associated with somebody called Selcook Bilgen who, the government contended, was (a) a terrorist, who was -- had blown himself up while Mr. Kurnaz was in detention -- may I simply finish this account -- while he was in detention and in a suicide bombing; and all that Mr. Kurnaz could say at his CSRT where he had no lawyer and had no access to information was I never had any reason to suspect he was a terrorist. Well, when the government, in the habeas proceedings, filed its factual return in Judge Green's court, it filed as its factual return the CSRT record. His counsel saw that accusation. Within 24 hours, his counsel had affidavits not only from the German prosecutor but from the supposedly deceased Mr. Bilgen, who is a resident of Dresden never involved in terrorism and fully getting on with his life. That's what -- and that evidence would not have been allowed in under DTA review. It wouldn't have been in the CSRT, and it won't come in under DTA review. And that's why it is inadequate.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I want to make an argument both from elegance and from function and from structure. Under the employment discrimination -- a wide range of employment discrimination, beginning with this Court's decision in McDonnell Douglas, this Court has applied a three-step balance-shifting paradigm in order to help juries resolve the question of whether discrimination occurred. In the disparate treatment cases there is a burden -- the first step, the plaintiff has to establish a prima facie case that he was the subject of disparate treatment because of his race or sex. The burden of production then shifts to the defendant in order to explain, under disparate treatment cases, a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason, which eliminates the presumption consistent with Evidence Rule 301, and the burden of proof then resumes on the plaintiff to prove discrimination because of the prohibited characteristic. Now, in Wards Cove, this Court looked both to Rule 301 and to the paradigm in other discrimination cases to apply a three-part test, in which there is a burden of proof to establish a presumption, a burden of production to neutralize it, and then a burden of proof to show because of race. The Second Circuit has done exactly that in this case, and we think they are right not just because that harmonizes this Court's prior discrimination cases, and not just because three seems to be more elegant than the four steps that the Petitioners want or the two steps that the Government wants, but because it makes sense. And this goes directly to the question, I think it was, that Justice Alito asked: Whether or not the \"reasonable factors other than age\" inquiry is simply what's necessary to show liability, that is, that it was because of. The ADEA doesn't prohibit disparate treatment. It doesn't prohibit disparate impact. It prohibits -- doesn't prohibit employment practices simply because they correlate negatively with age. A plaintiff has to prove that he has suffered adverse employment action because of his age. And the question whether an employer based its action on reasonable factors other than age is part and parcel of that inquiry. It's not a free-standing --",
  "-- confession and avoidance defense.",
  "No, not at all. Not at all. If I said that, I certainly don't want to be mistaken. We are not up here arguing that there is no disparate impact theory of liability under the ADEA as there is under Title VII. This Court resolved that question in Smith, and it resolved it in large part by reference to the \"reasonable factors other than age\" provision, which Justice Stevens' opinion for a plurality of the Court explained that, when you have a disparate treatment case, if the plaintiff proves that his -- his or her treatment -- if the defendant proves that it was because of something other than age, it isn't disparate treatment. The fact that there is an RFOA provision, we think, does reflect the fact that there is the potential for liability under disparate impact, but as this Court explained, it's narrower. And it's narrower because -- not only because the 1991 amendments didn't apply to age cases; it's narrower, because as this Court has recognized in almost every age case it has decided, age -- unlike race and sex and religion and national origin -- often does -- sad to say by somebody who is in his second decade of protection under the ADEA -- often does correlate with reasonable employment factors. And the fact that all -- what it means is that at step one of the burden-shifting analysis, the Wards Cove analysis, which in a race or sex case establishes a strong presumption that the employment action was because of race or sex because there are so few employment characteristics that do correlate negatively with one's race or one's gender, it's a strong presumption which nonetheless need be met only by a burden of production. This Court has recognized that in the age context, the presumption actually is quite weak. And it would be more than perverse to adopt the Government's proposal, which is that notwithstanding the much weaker inference, the burden of persuasion is now on the employer, not the employee. And, in fact, the principal problem, I would say, with the Government the EEOC proposal --",
  "Excuse me?",
  "May I just finish my sentence --",
  "-- Justice Stevens, and go right to \"otherwise prohibited\"? The government's proposal under which, once the employer establishes the statistical disparity, the burden of proof shifts to the employer, equates what this Court has said over and over again is a prima facie case or a presumption into liability. It would dictate precisely the opposite result that this Court found in St. Mary's Honor Center. It would allow the jury, upon silence by the defendant, not to say, well, you may consider this presumption to be enough if you don't hear any other evidence. It would tell the jury the proof of statistical disparity is proof of discrimination. And that's just wrong. Now, \"otherwise prohibited\" --",
  "Right.",
  "That's exactly right. Now, with respect to the structure of the statute and \"otherwise prohibited,\" the -- my friends on the other side of this case turn almost everything on the fact that the \"reasonable factors other than age\" provision applies in -- in subsection (f) and is -- as Justice Ginsburg said -- is sandwiched in between two other provisions that, for argument's sake, let's just acknowledge are affirmative defenses on which the employer would bear the burden of proof. And why doesn't that prove anything? I'll go first to \"otherwise prohibited\" and then explain why the sandwich effect is no more persuasive here than it was to the Court in Betts. \"Otherwise prohibited\" means that it is prohibited subject to the following conditions. It doesn't say who bears the burden of those conditions. What it reflects, Justice Stevens, is this fact. You could have taken everything that is in F and just put it into A, but you would then have had to put it into B and C and E. And so what Congress said was -- it didn't say not -- things that are prohibited in Section A won't be unlawful if X, Y and Z. It says \"otherwise prohibited\" in those sections. In other words, it doesn't -- it means nothing other than it's prohibited subject to the following conditions. Now, I will acknowledge for argument's purposes -- and it actually suits my argument -- to show that the BFOQ defense and the foreign-employer defense are affirmative defenses. Because as we -- as we know from Black's Law Dictionary and this Court's decisions, Dixon, for example, an affirmative defense is a defense that says: I admit the allegations of the complaint, but I have a justification for it that the law recognizes. Now, that's --",
  "No. It is quite to the contrary, unless -- and it may be the case that I'm completely misunderstanding you. The point is that at step one the plaintiff has to prove a statistical disparity, a substantial, negative, statistical correlation. And that raises a presumption that what was otherwise a neutral -- appears to be a neutral factor was, in fact, because of age. That these --",
  "Whether it's --",
  "Well, no. What this -- what this Court said in Griggs is there are proof problems. There are plenty of instances in which there is undiscovered, unreconciled, unacknowledged inferences about people. And old people is the perfect example where there is no history of invidious discrimination. There is no prior hurdle that, unlike black people and women had to overcome -- which was another factor in Griggs. It's that we all get old, and people have preconceptions sometimes about the enormity of limitations of age which may not be justified. So the way that these defenses, the sandwich, if you will, works is the plaintiff under Wards Cove shows his statistical case. It's a prima facie -- it shows that there is a disparate impact, period. But the statute --",
  "No, well let -- let me see if I can't address Justice Souter's point first. I do think I understand your point, which is what's wrong with the Petitioner's case. But, Justice Souter, the point is that once a prima facie case is established in an age case -- let's just take the three provisions that are at issue in (f)(1). Under BFOQ, the employer gets up and says: Well, ladies and gentlemen, the judge is going to tell you that they have established a prima facie case that the way that these otherwise neutral -- that this was because of the plaintiff's age. And you know what? I admit it. I, in fact, admit that it was by accident because of age.",
  "Correct.",
  "What he basically says is: I agree that age was the factor, but I have an excuse for it. And, similarly, in the third exception, the foreign-employers exception, he comes in and says: You have heard all of the statistics. And you know what? I did do this to disadvantage old people, because my plant is in a country that discriminates -- that makes it illegal for people over 65 to work. But --",
  "That's correct. And that's why I admit -- I admit that I did this in a way that had a disparate impact on old people. I did it, if you will, in order to -- I have a justification for it. Whereas, in the reasonable factors other than age, the assertion is everybody understands that the plaintiff has the ultimate burden to prove that he or she suffered an adverse employment action because of age, not because of some factor that for entirely good reasons correlates with age. And the showing that there is a statistical --",
  "No.",
  "No, no; not at all.",
  "Let's take their -- let's take their 50-pound hypothetical. The employer says: Okay, from now on all of our employees have to be able to lift 50 pounds over their head, you know, 10 times in 30 seconds. And older people or women -- let's say older people, you know, say: Well, statistically, that has wiped us out. That has had a substantial -- a substantial adverse effect on us because we are old, and we have less upper body strength. The employer then gives -- comes forward with a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason or a reasonable factor other than age, and says, for example, well, you know, this is -- we need our employees to be able to lift strong things. If the plaintiff comes back and says, I am an accountant, that's not reasonable, it's a very different case than if this is a requirement imposed on stocking clerks in an auto parts -- auto parts shop where you do have to lift very heavy things over your head. In other words, the paradigm that this Court set out in Wards Cove applies exactly the same way. It applies a three-part test except that at step three the standard of justification is different. And this, I think -- I hope, Justice Stephens, goes to your question. In Wards Cove this Court said you show a prima facie case of a disparate impact. The burden then -- the burden of production then shifts to the employer to explain that it was -- there is a business -- to articulate a business justification for the facially neutral requirement. And what the plaintiff then has to do is bear the burden of proving that that wasn't a business necessity; that there is one other way, one other way in which it could have been done; and, therefore --",
  "Yes. And, in fact, I think it's sort of embedded in the very opening of the blue brief in this case, where the Petitioner says: Well, the Court has sometimes used the word \"business justification,\" and the Court has sometimes used the word \"business necessity,\" and we don't really think that means anything, so we use the words interchangeably. But this case shows that it means everything because at step three of Wards Cove the petitioner -- the plaintiff's burden is proving that it is -- that there is one other way -- that all you have to show is that it wasn't a necessity to do it that way in order to achieve your objective and the employee wins. But because of the differential in correlation between age and employment factors, in this case it is a business justification; that is, the employee has to come in and say it just wasn't reasonable to use that. And this case is a perfect example. Here we have a research lab that has one client. It's the nuclear reactor division of the United States submarine unit. And they come, and they say -- and there is no dispute about the facts here -- they say the Cold War is over. We aren't going to have as much work for you. And since you're cost-plus, you're going to have to reduce your work force; and because we are in a different kind of war, we have new missions. You are going to have to design and engineer and implement things that you hadn't done it before. And so you need to figure out a way to go ahead and do this. And what the company did was to go through all of its units and then subunits and sections, and say: Given the new mission that the Navy has told us we are going to have to occupy, do you have people -- do you have more people than you're going to get paid for to do what you have to do? If the answer is yes -- if the answer is no, you're fine. If the answer is yes, please consider the following: What are the skills within the people within your section, subsection, or unit that are excess, that in light of the reduced and changed mission we don't need? Identify those skills. Then go through each one of your employees; and if it is an employee with that skill, rank them on a scale of 1 to 10 according to four different characteristics: Seniority, which gives a benefit to older workers; recent job-performance ratings; the criticality of the other skills they have, do they have some other skill that is going to be required; and their flexibility -- how willing have they been, or are they, to learn new skills? And the company has a training manual. It goes through and trains the managers to do this. It is approved by the Department of Energy and the Department of the Navy. But after the managers engage in this analysis and prepare this matrix, they then have to justify it before a central review board, which the plaintiff's own expert acknowledged was set up in order to make the managers defend each decision and make sure that those judgments corresponded with overall management's responsibilities.",
  "That's correct. And as the district court found and the court of appeals found, those were strikingly stark numbers. They were so stark that they came to the immediate attention of the company's management and general counsel, Mr. Correa, who was -- who looked at this and said: We are going to get sued for age discrimination. What should we do about this? And what he did about this, what the proof showed, is he went back and said: Is each one of these decisions justifiable? Did they really apply these factors? He testified that he considered just saying: We'll go back and redo it so that the age distribution comes out right. But he was concerned that the New York human rights law, which defines -- this is sort of astounding -- defines \"older worker\" as somebody over 18, does have a reverse-discrimination provision. But the point here is -- and, therefore, he decided: We did this right; we used a matrix that unrebutted testimony said was the paradigm in industry.",
  "They definitely do. And the second question that was presented in this case, which the Court didn't accept, was an assertion by the Petitioner that the Second Circuit had assertedly held that where a reasonable factor other than age derives from a subjective judgment, the Second Circuit had held that it was immune from review under disparate-impact theory, which, as the Government pointed out in its invitation brief, is not at all what the Second Circuit held. The point is that this Court in Smith and earlier in Hazen Paper and earlier age cases was highly cognizant of the fact that unless there is a test that implies that -- that applies certainty for employers, there is going to be -- age -- if this standard isn't reasonable and if it isn't up to the other side to prove that it's unreasonable, employers are essentially going to take age into account. They are going to do what Mr. Correa testified he wouldn't do, which is rejigger the results to come up with a -- a percentage that more approximated the balance in the work force. And that, this Court has said repeatedly --",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, that is why -- and it was testimony both from the employees in the case and from our uncross-examined expert and even their expert -- the review board -- the company set up a central review board which was trained and which examined every single manager about every single decision, whether you call it subjective or objective. Now, the district court -- the trial court who heard the testimony said that he -- he deemed flexibility and criticality objective. He said they were objective factors because of all the instructions that were given, which we have reprinted in the joint appendix in this case. But even assuming -- and I certainly take your point, Justice Ginsburg, that if you ask a manager to evaluate an employee on the degree of criticality of that employee's skills or the flexibility of that employee, you can give her all the training in the world. You can give her a 16-point checklist. Ultimately, you're relying on a judgment by a human being of another human being. But why would we not want employers to do that? Why would we want them to -- to retreat to the safe harbor of some safe quota. You know, gee, we have a 60/40 split in our work force; and, wow, these numbers, we did it according to Hoyle. We've done -- this is the paradigm RIF process, but go back and do it in a way that comes out with a specific set of numbers.",
  "Well, I think it goes to both. I mean it goes to -- it simply -- it certainly goes to the question over whether, whoever has the burden on reasonableness, you ought to do what you did in Smith and what the Eleventh Circuit did in Montalvo, which is the case you cited in Smith. And in --",
  "Well, we have a jury verdict. We have a jury verdict under Wards Cove. The court of appeals, as we pointed out in -- to the court of appeals the first time and in our petition for certiorari here the last time and to the court of appeals the second time and to this Court on pages 4, 5, and 7 of our brief in opposition this time -- the court of appeals was simply wrong in both step one and step three of Wards Cove. This is even assuming Wards Cove were the test. There is -- under step three of Wards Cove, which is how this case was tried, it was concededly the plaintiff's burden to prove that there was some other way, one other way, to do what the company wanted that established that this wasn't a business necessity. And I will represent to the Court that in five and a half weeks of testimony there is not one sentence of evidence to that effect.",
  "What Judge Jacobs said is the case was tried under business necessity, under which the plaintiffs at least had to prove that there was some other way that the company could equally have achieved its objectives.",
  "No, because the EEOC regulation at the time, regulation (d), which deals with disparate-impact cases, said that reasonable -- the reasonable factors other than age provision is proven by, and only by, the business-necessity defense, a defense as to which the plaintiffs bear the burden. And, in fact, in Wards Cove, the Government in Wards Cove was on the employer's side. The Government urged the court to do exactly what it did. And under the Government's own regulation 1625.7(d), the burden of proving reasonable factors other than age was correctly on the plaintiff, but incorrectly equated with the substantive showing of business.",
  "Well, no, we took the position that reasonable factors other than age was a separate test and was a separate defense.",
  "The judge instructed the jury to the contrary and said under Wards Cove --",
  "Well, what happened was -- I mean, Judge Pooler is wrong in certain respects, but not that respect. We -- our answer pleaded reasonable factors other than age, but we didn't -- neither we nor our opponents asked for a separate instruction on reasonable factors other than age. The jury was instructed on the Wards Cove analysis because --",
  "That's correct. I mean that -- and that's because -- you could say that it was a mutual mistake by everyone involved. But the EEOC had directed under subsection (d) of its regulations that reasonable factor other than age could be established only by proving business necessity. And both parties --",
  "That's correct. And the -- my point is we are -- we are entitled to judgment in our favor. We are entitled to an affirmance because, number one, the Second Circuit was correct that the burden of proving reasonableness was on them, and the -- the Petitioners have acknowledged expressly on page 53 of their blue brief that if in fact it is true that the Second -- if the Second Circuit is in fact correct, then the judgment is affirmed, that is, they say when a -- \"While a defendant has no obligation to press an issue upon which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof -- and therefore the Second Circuit may have been justified in reviewing the evidence of reasonableness in light of its holding that Petitioners bore the burden of proof\" --",
  "We pleaded it as a -- I can't bring the complaint to mind, but we pleaded it as a separately specified defense, yes. We said, in our answer to the complaint, we said this is a reasonable factor other than age. And so we are -- everyone acknowledges that if the Second Circuit is correct as to where the burden applies, the judgment should be affirmed. Our submission is that the judgment has to be affirmed whether or not the burden applies as the Second Circuit held. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns conflict pre-emption under the Supremacy Clause, and the conflict presented here is stark. Repeatedly over the years, the FDA approved Phenergan injection as safe and effective under all the conditions and methods of use described in the labeling, including what is referred to as \"IV push\" injection. Yet a State jury, evaluating the same risk that the FDA had considered, determined that the precise labeling that FDA had required Wyeth to use in fact rendered Phenergan \"unreasonably dangerous.\" That - -",
  "Well, let me make sure, because I do think we do agree, and I want to make sure that I'm understood, Justice Kennedy. I think what you've articulated is the test which is, is it possible for a regulated party to comply at the same time with both Federal law and State law? In other words, could they use, as they were required by Federal law to do, to use the precise label that in approving the application in 1998 the FDA required Wyeth to use, and also use the label that the Vermont jury determined should be used, and that was stated in the complaint and in the opening and the closing a statement that you may not, should not use IV administration or IV push, in other words that you should contra -- the label should contra-indicate something - -",
  "-- that - -",
  "Yes it did, Justice Ginsburg, and I want to cite you to the portions of the record that demonstrate that it did. But before I do so, I just want to underscore a point that I think is clear from both our brief and the Solicitor General's brief, which is that isn't the test of preemption in any event. The question is what did the labeling say and upon what information was the labeling decision made. But as to your particular question, there are -- first of all, there was testimony in the record from multiple parties, including experts from both sides, that the FDA was aware of all of the forms of administration and the risk, including IV push. Their experts simply disagreed with the judgment that the labeling requires. But most saliently, the labeling in this case, which is reproduced, in sort of microscopic size unfortunately, on the last two pages of the petitioner appendix and the last two pages of the joint appendix, have four separate reference that, as we explained in footnote 11 of our reply brief, only apply to IV push. There is a reference to the use of the Tubex system. That is a direct IV push system. There is a reference to rigid plungers and small-bore needles. Again nothing to do with drip. There is a reference to a maximum rate of administration. Drip is gravity. The testimony in the case was that an instruction that a particular rate of administration not be exceeded only referred to IV push. And finally, there are cautions on the label about how the ordinary aspiration of blood to see if its bright or dark, which is only done in the context of a needle that is being used to push something into a vein, is not reliable in the context of this case because Phenergan discolors arterial blood immediately. So the labeling plainly comprehended and warned about the specific risks of IV push administration, and that's not all. There is an advisory -- an advisory committee in 1976 was asked to look at precisely the risk of arterial exposure to Phenergan injection or any other irritant drug that is administered intravenously and it made specific recommendations, including recommendations that go directly to IV push.",
  "I mean, there was testimony -- Justice Alito, I can go over the testimony, but there is -- there was testimony in this very case about those very circumstances in which direct IV injection is indicated. And there is also test -- there is also evidence in the FDA record, including if you look at the 1987 correspondence that the FDA sent to Wyeth in the context of talking about what warnings had to be provided. The FDA provided Wyeth 20 citations to 20 medical journals that addressed this problem, and in footnote 13 of our reply brief we've cited the ones that specifically address the circumstances in which IV push administration is an important tool. The point here is, I think, that - -",
  "Justice Ginsburg, this is labeling that is directed at medical professionals. It is labeling that is directed at physicians, who have to be able to determine what method, what pharmaceutical and what method of administration to use, given the constellation of risks and benefits that a particular patient - -",
  "The FDA -- well, the FDA certainly is. And the issue, Justice Kennedy, here is the FDA has to decide what information to provide to clinicians so that they can make judgments about what to use. And it -- what it did here is it provided ample, lavish warnings about the risk of intra-arterial injection and exposure of an irritant drug like Phenergan to arterial blood. It provided in the labeling to the physicians a cascading hierarchy of methods of administration. It said intramuscular injection is the preferred method. It then said with respect to intravenous injection that it is, as with any irritant drug, it is usually preferable to inject it into an IV infusion set that is known to be running properly, in other words where a line has already been established into the vein and the IV push occurs into the line that's already established. All that information was available to physicians and the FDA has to understand and does understand that in labeling to allow medical professionals to make their judgments, taking options away from physicians is not always better. It may not -- it may not even often be better. What the FDA has to decide in terms of telling physicians what's on the table and what's off the table and in terms of what's on the table what the relevant risks are is, is this ever -- would this ever be medically warranted? The testimony in this case and in the administrative record was yes, there are circumstances - -",
  "Yes. I mean, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, you've identified the respect in which this is difference than the medical device area. But for the salient purposes, I think the Riegel case directly points the Court to the nature of the determination that the FDA makes with respect to class 3 drugs. It goes through the same preclearance process. As we pointed out in our brief and as I think Justice Scalia's opinion in Riegel points out, the balancing time-intensive, data- intensive inquiry for medical devices was patterned after what is done for drugs, and it reflects a balancing of risks and benefits of the particular drug in light of the conditions and methods of administration prescribed in the labeling.",
  "Well, let me address both the established background of State actions and then the pre-emption clause difference, if I may. The Respondent and her amici have identified 97 cases going back 150 years in which tort actions have been brought with respect to pharmaceuticals. Very few of those cases - - and they are recent -- are implicated by the rule that the Vermont Supreme Court applied in this case, which is where a fully informed FDA, informed of all the information that Wyeth had, approved a labeling standard, but a court looking at the same evidence can reach a different conclusion about what is on the label. The most -- those cases I believe all post-date Cipollone. Many of them postdate Geier. And by my count, there are fewer than 20 such cases out of all of the cases that have been decided and those issues - - that issue had never come up and never could have come up when Congress enacted the 1938 Act, because it was only the 1938 Act that established a drug-specific, preclearance regime, and really in 1962, in which the FDA was required not just to evaluate safety in terms of licensing the distribution of the drug, but to balance safety against effectiveness. And so the -- the constellation of common law cases -- I mean, let me just say we are -- we are not seeking here a rule of field preemption. We are not seeking to preclude tort remedies for conduct that violates Federal law. What we are saying here is -- and this goes, I think, finally to your point about the express pre-emption clause -- the presence of expressed pre-emption clauses or the absence, the presence of a savings clause or the absence, does not and cannot affect the operation of conflict pre-emption under the Federal Constitution. Now, members of this Court are concerned about applying a broad, vague, or free-wheeling analysis of implied conflict pre-emption, but this case is heartland. A jury was asked to look at the same information and conclude that the precise language that the FDA just didn't allow, the FDA required Wyeth to use, rendered that drug unreasonably unsafe.",
  "The liability in this case was not predicated on the fact that Wyeth didn't go to the -- remember, the FDA had approved this label two years before Miss Levine was injured. In approving the label, it rejected stronger proposed language that Wyeth had presented. There was nothing that was -- Wyeth was - -",
  "Right.",
  "Yes, you are right. We -- we have both an impossibility form of conflict because, in the absence of any new information or new analyses of old information, we could not make the change in advance of getting approval. And we also have an -- an objects-and-purposes form of conflict pre-emption because the Vermont jury decided on the same information that the labeling that the FDA had approved and required was unreasonably unsafe. And we cannot have a world in which the very day after an intensive process -- the FDA says you may distribute this drug, but you must use this specific language -- either, A, manufacturers can just run in and change the label and ask for permission down the road; or, B, that a State jury -- let's take the easier case -- a State legislature or 50 State legislatures can decide: Because you could have gone back and asked, we can impose an obligation on you that you must have done so or must have changed the labeling. That just is inconsistent with - -",
  "Either a negligence theory or a strict-liability theory would be pre-empted. May I reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I want to make -- I do want to go to -- make a preliminary point about all the talk about misbranding here. The statute has two criminal prohibitions. One is misbranding, which is the original 1906 reactive penalty. If the FDA subsequently finds that something is false or misleading, it CAN come after you for misbranding. But this case involves the criminal prohibition against distributing drugs for which there is not an approved, effective application. And that's what's at stake here. Now, the notion that there was any -- any misunderstanding in the trial court about whether there was new information or whether there was -- there were incidents that the FDA didn't know about, or it didn't evaluate the risk, is just flat wrong. The plaintiff tried this -- the plaintiff's experts said the FDA knew about this risk. Wyeth knew about this risk for decades. That is what is so wrong. That is why he stood up and said the FDA doesn't decide this question. You decide this question. And there was never, ever a suggestion in the record in this case, nor could there have been, that Wyeth ever failed to bring every single adverse-event report to the FDA's attention, every analysis that it did to the FDA's attention. And what the record does show is that after -- between the time of the 1955 approval of the new-drug application and the 1998 rejection of the SDNA, the Supplemental New -- SNDA, the Supplemental New Drug Application, that did have more extensive, stronger warnings in this case, Wyeth filed five -- and these are all in the joint appendix -- five supplemental, new-drug applications, each one asking for more language, more warnings, about direct IV injection. It's not called \"push.\" It's IV injection versus drip, which is a gravity method. And, in fact, Mr. Frederick says: Well, you know, in this case there could have been stronger warnings, and that -- and this case wasn't really about -- the jury wasn't really asked to -- it didn't really say that the label had to contra indicate something that the FDA-labeling required. That is exactly the opposite of what the trial lawyer told the jury at opening and at closing. What he said is this was unreasonably unsafe because it didn't say: Do not use by intravenous administration. With respect to whether or not the warning -- the last SNDA which we submitted, which was in 1987 and is reprinted in the joint appendix -- not only is it an original, but there is a typewritten version that actually has the text in the type size that one can actually read. At the summary-judgment stage that the pre-emption issue was decided -- may I finish my answer?",
  "Summary judgment was decided at the -- pre-emption was decided at summary judgment before trial. So there was no evidence about what was new or wasn't new. In Ms. Levine's motion for summary judgment, she uses the word \"new\" information about labeling change. And, with respect to the proposed 1987 language, the '88 change that we asked for, she said - - and I'm reading from page 24 of her motion for summary judgment -- \"In 1988, Wyeth drafted changes to the warning which advised that the use of a free-flowing IV would ensure adequate dilution and reduce the risk of arterial injectia. Although not strong enough, this improved the labeling instruction; if followed, would have prevented the inadvertent administration of Phenergan into an artery for the reasons described.\"",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 484 plainly has pre-emptive effect, and what it pre-empts, quoting this Court's decision in Watters, is, quote, \"the State's investigative and enforcement machinery,\" close quote.",
  "Oh, I -- I quite agree, and I did not mean to suggest that this Court's decision in Watters, you know, the holding in Watters concludes the outcome of this case. But this Court, in section II A of Watters -- and we did have a State statutory regime that dealt, yes, with licensure but also with examination, supervision, and enforcement, including judicial enforcement -- this Court repeatedly described that what was pre-empted is -- and this goes to, I think, a point that Justice Scalia was making -- was not substantive pre-emption. There are substantive pre-emption provisions that are addressed in other sections of the Act, including the one that was at issue in Smiley. What is exempted, this Court said again and again, is the State's enforcement and investment and - - investigative and enforcement machinery, or its examination and enforcement authority, and that those - -",
  "The question in the case is whether or not what the Attorney General here sought to do is the exercise of a visitorial power.",
  "There -- the letters are in the record in the Joint Appendix.",
  "Yes, that - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "I'd like to - -",
  "I'd like to address both the vertical and horizontal axes of what I perceive to be your question. One is the distinction that this Court drew in Guthrie, where it said there is a -- there's a huge distinction in determining what's a visitorial power between a private individual seeking to vindicate a deprivation of his or her traditional property right, which is what was at issue there, and what the Court - - what this Court said was the public right of visitation, which it also explained was the State's, quote, \"enforcing observance of its laws and regulations.\" There is a public and private distinction, and visitation deals with the former.",
  "It deals with the sovereign.",
  "Justice Breyer, I'll get to the horizontal axis in a moment. I'm afraid I'm going to forget - -",
  "Let me go -- let me go to your axis first, which is to say that anything that is a visitorial power can also be interpreted as a police or enforcement power, and what Congress had in mind -- this is legislation that was born in the crucible of the Civil War, and what Congress sought to pre-empt was State executive action, State examination and enforcement action with respect to these newly created, very important Federal instrumentalities. That was historically done, this Court explained in Guthrie, and Chancellor Kent and Blackstone and many other authorities agree was historically done through access to the courts; and in fact what Dean Pound in his oft-cited article about visitorial powers said, was - - he said, and this is discussed at pages 16 through 18 of the amicus brief of the Financial Services Roundtable - - what he called, quote, \"the leading case for visitorial powers in equity\" was a case called the Attorney General v Chicago and Northwest Railroad decided in 1874, in which the Attorney General of Wisconsin was seeking to require this railroad to comply with the State's mandated rate schedule. That was a visitorial power, even though you could also call it a law enforcement power. Now, Justice Breyer, on the horizontality of your question: This is not a suit in which the New York Attorney General is trying to enforce its employment discrimination laws or its health laws or its zoning laws. The attorney general wants the loan records of national banks, and he wants them so that he can evaluate for himself whether the banks are making proper judgments about how to market and how to price their loans.",
  "Yes, they would. And in fact --",
  "Well, their -- the OCC in the preamble to its regulations does draw a distinction between State enforcement actions and a pure State declaratory judgment, quote, \"as to the meaning of the applicable law.\" This is a case that -- in which - -",
  "Well, this is -- this case is certainly in the core, but a -- a State authority, whether it's the State banking commission or the State human rights commission or the State attorney general, or for that matter another Federal Government authority, that seeks to call a national bank to account for the manner in which it is conducting an expressly designated, allocated banking power is an exercise of visitorial power.",
  "I don't - -",
  "The -- the State's enforcement of any law that is directed at a national bank's authorized banking powers is a visitorial power. And the fact that it may also be characterized as a police power or a lawsuit is -- is interesting, but not what's at stake. What Congress aimed at -- Congress in 1864 knew -- the Supreme Court said, Blackstone and Kent had said -- that visitorial powers on civil corporations are exercised A, by the sovereign, not by a private individual, and B, are almost always exercised through access to the courts. Whether they are invoking the courts' authority to seek records or not, that was the historical core of what visitorial powers - -",
  "That's correct. And a sovereign taking a national bank into court with respect to not any old general law, but with respect to the conduct of its specifically authorized national banking powers, is the exercise of visitorial powers.",
  "That was the reason for the courts of justice exception.",
  "I don't think -- I think that if I understood your question, and I may not have -- if a suit by a private individual or a group of private individuals seeking to indicate the deprivation of a private traditional right is not visitorial; but if the State, either directly in the enforcement of its general laws or seeking to protect the people of its State, goes into court or asks for records or anything else, it is exercising a traditional visitorial power. May -- while I have your attention, may I also go back to your question about 36(f) and Riegle-Neal, because there is yet -- there are other additional indicators that when the Congress said in 36(f) that these State laws shall be enforced by the OCC, it was mandatory and exclusive. First of all, the colloquy that was discussed and is reported in our brief, I think at page 26, does use the word \"enforce\" as well as \"supervise,\" but more to the point - -",
  "Yes. Riegle-Neal -- here's the most important point. That provision that we've been were looking at had a cognate, had an analogue that was also enforced. Riegle-Neal basically said out-of-state banks can now branch bank. When they do so, they are subject to these four categories of State laws. The provision we have been looking, which was section 102, said with respect to enforcement of those laws, the OCC shall enforce it. But section 105 said where the out-of-state bank is a State-chartered bank -- and this is reported, I think it's at section 1820(h) of title 12, when it's a State-chartered bank, the State authorities of the host State shall enforce the laws.",
  "So it enacted a dual regime that demonstrates exactly what Congress had in mind, which is that there would be one regulator making the kind of judgments about, okay, there is a disparity, but let's look at credit history, let's look at the loan to equity value, let's look at income versus debt incurred, and all these factors that the OCC and the Fed have explained have to go into making a judgment about whether or not a particular condition of a particular loan violates Federal law, whether it the Fair Housing Act or the Equal Credit Opportunity Act or the Fed's regulation B.",
  "May I answer? I believe that it would if those incidental authorities are in fact authorized, approved and regulated by the OCC, but this case doesn't require you to address it, because this is an express power under section 371(a).",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The requirement that corporations fund electoral advocacy the same way individuals do, that is with money voluntarily committed by people associated with the corporation, is grounded in interests that are so compelling that 52 years ago, before Buckley was decided, before FECA was enacted, before Buckley-style quid pro quo corruption was ever addressed, this Court explained that, quote: \"What is involved here is the integrity of our electoral process and not less the responsibility of the individual citizen for the successful functioning of that process.\" If the Court now wishes to reconsider the existence and extent of the interests that underlie that sentiment expressed for the Court by Justice Frankfurter in the context of a prosecution of union officials for running television ads supporting political candidates, it should do so in a case in which those interests are forthrightly challenged with a proper and full record below.",
  "Well, I don't recall who the professor was either, Mr. Chief Justice, but I do recall pretty well the history that was recounted -- I would say the history that was recounted by this Court in the Auto Workers case, in CIO, in the Pipefitters case, which is quite inconsistent with that. We've never had this case -- until this Court's supplemental order, we never had a case that challenged directly, quote, \"Austin\" and Austin-style corruption, which is a term I think that is quite misleading. When the sober-minded Elihu Root was moved to stand up in 1894 and urged the people of the United States, and urged the Congress of the United States, to enact legislation that would address, quote, \"a constantly growing evil which has done more to shake the confidence of plain people of small means of this country in our political institutions than any practice which has ever obtained since the founding of our government,\" he was not engaging in a high level discussion about political philosophy.",
  "He -- with all due respect, Justice Kennedy, I don't think that there was any distinction whatsoever in that time between the distinction that this Court came to understand as a result of FECA, and its adjudication of FECA and that - - really the prehistory of Taft-Hartley, between contributions expenditures. For this reason, Justice Kennedy, was that what Root said was the idea -- and I am quoting now from his speech which is also partly reprinted in this Court's opinion in McConnell -- the idea is to prevent the great companies, the great aggregations of wealth from using corporate funds directly or indirectly to send members of the legislature to these halls in order to vote for their protection and the advancement of their interests as against those of the public.",
  "Justice Scalia, I take your point and I think you have made this point forceful lily many times before. A unanimous court in National Right to Work Committee concluded that Congress was entitled to make the judgment that it would treat in order to address this root evil, a problem of such concern that it goes to the very foundation of the democratic republican exercise, that is, the notion of integrity in representative government. Now this -- this case, of course, is not a case - -",
  "Right. And Justice Scalia, if a small corporation or even any corporation of any sort wants to bring an as-applied challenge to 441b or a State law analogue and say, you know, I am not the problem that Theodore Roosevelt and Elihu Root was addressed at; there isn't a compelling interest because I only have three employees and $8,000 in my bank account, that's fine. But what is extraordinary, truly extraordinary, given the sentiments that underlay the Tillman Act and the Taft-Hartley Act is that we would be having a discussion today about the constitutionality of a law that has been on the books forever when no party, no corporation, has ever raised the challenge. I well recall - -",
  "Justice Kennedy, first of all, I -- I think it is actually true that patents are owned by individuals and not corporations. But be that as it may, there is no doubt -- I am not here saying that this Court should reconsider Bellotti on first principles any more than I am saying that it shouldn't consider Austin on first principles. Corporations can and do speak about a wide range of public policy issues, and since the controlling opinion was issued in Wisconsin Right to Life, the -- the kind of campaign-related speech that corporations can't engage in, in the pre-election period is limited to the functional equivalent of expressed advocacy and nothing else.",
  "My point here is, Justice Alito -- and I don't mean to be -- to be demeaning this Court with sound bites. The point is that what -- Austin was, to be sure, the very first case in which this Court had to decide -- actually had to decide whether or not the prohibition on corporate treasury funded campaign speech could properly be limited and was supporting by a compelling interest. All I am suggesting -- and I hope that if you take nothing else from my advocacy today it will be this -- is that we have here a case in which the Court has asked a question that essentially goes to the bona fides, that is, the factual predicates of the interests that have been viewed as compelling in Austin, in MCFL, in McConnell itself, whether you call it the corrosive effect of corporate wealth, whether you call it, quote, \"shareholder protection\" - -",
  "Mr. Olson is -- was quite right -- either Mr. Olson or Mr. Abrams, I find it so difficult to tell the two apart. One of them was saying, well, it's, you know -- yes, I think in response to Justice Sotomayor's question, you know, about there is no factual record here. There is absolutely nothing in this case. And the response was, well, it's the government's burden. The government has to prove that any restriction that it imposes passes strict scrutiny. Fair enough, but the question has to be raised. The issue has to be raised. If the -- if Austin, Justice Alito, or the compelling interests that Austin and McConnell relied on were forthrightly challenged in a case, the government would have the option - -",
  "Well, that's because the ultimate -- I assume I have your permission to answer.",
  "The -- the only challenges that were litigated in the district court -- and they largely were related to disclosure -- were very direct as-applied challenges that had -- that did nothing whatsoever to implicate the foundation of McConnell or Austin. And all I'm saying is, if you want to re - examine the predicates, the existence and magnitude of interests that Congress has, going back a -- whether it's 60 years or 100 years, and courts, whether it has been the actual rationale of the decision or a predicate of the rationale of the decision, you ought to do it in a case where the -- where the issue is squarely presented so that the government can do what it did in McConnell and in another context in Michigan v. Grutter when it suggested that Aderand had undermined this Court's controlling opinion in Bakke. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Unlike courts, arbitrators derive their authority solely from the consent of the parties to a particular agreement. That agreement determines not only what the parties have agreed to arbitrate, but just as fundamentally, with whom they have agreed to do so. And when the agreement reveals no intent, no meeting of the minds to add participants, but the arbitrators nonetheless extend their reach to hundreds of parties of other contracts, they violate the basic principle reflected in the FAA that their authority is created and circumscribed by an agreement. The decision to impose class proceedings is not the kind of incidental procedural matter that arbitrators have to resolve in order to discharge their responsibilities under the foundational agreement.",
  "I respectfully disagree, Justice Ginsburg. The arbitrators -- the agreement reflected in paragraph 7 of the supplemental agreement -- that is, to proceed to arbitration under the auspices of Rules 3 through 7 of the AAA rules, and Rule 3 itself contemplated precisely submitting precisely the contract issue that the Bazzle plurality said should go to the arbitrators. That is, looking at the arbitration clause itself, does it objectively reveal an agreement among the two parties to permit or prohibit class or consolidated treatment, or is it truly silent? That is a question of contract interpretation. That is the question that was submitted to the arbitrators. There is a separate statutory question that arises if the answer to the contract question is number 3. There is no meeting of the minds. It is truly silent --",
  "Excuse me.",
  "Justice Breyer --",
  "I very -- I very much doubt that you are way out-of-date. If you are, I shudder to think where I am. But let me be clear --",
  "I hope I am as up-to-date as I need to be to provide a coherent, correct answer. My proposition is twofold, and only the second part gets to your question. The first is that the arbitrators in this case decided the contractual question, the -- did the parties have a meeting of the minds, yes or no? And if so, was it?",
  "And the arbitrators then went on to say: Even though there is no meeting of the minds objectively revealed, nonetheless we are going to apply a background rule that puts the burden on the party opposing arbitration to prove that there is an intent to preclude. So, we're establishing that the --",
  "Exactly.",
  "And I have an answer --",
  "The question --",
  "Well, you are nowhere near up to me, then.",
  "Yes. No, no, no --",
  "No, no, no. What -- and I -- I'm interpreting the plurality opinion that you wrote -- or you and three of your colleagues.",
  "Okay. Well, our understanding -- what Bazzle said is, at the very beginning of the opinion -- look, here's the case: The South Carolina Supreme Court found that the arbitration clause is truly silent, and it then applied a rule of State law that says, if it's silent, class treatment will be permitted. We granted certiorari in this case to decide whether that rule of South Carolina law applied to this case is precluded by the FAA, which requires actual consent, not coercion. Now, what the plurality in Bazzle, with respect, said is: We can't reach the legal question, the statutory FAA question on which we granted review, because we can't be certain that the contract really is silent. To be sure, there’s no express provision, but Bazzle -- the Bazzle plaintiffs say that it is silent, and Green Tree says, no, if you look at other words in it, including the right to choose each arbitrator for each arbitration, it's not -- the South Carolina courts answered the question, but they are not the ones, because when you are talking about a question of the interpretation of a contract that has committed to arbitration, that is for the arbitrators to decide. The arbitrators have to decide whether there was actually a meeting of the minds.",
  "And the --",
  "If -- yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Exactly. So in Bazzle --",
  "Right. Exactly. And -- and this case presents exactly the same answer to that question that Bazzle presented when it was granted review; that is, there is -- there was an interpretation of the contract in Bazzle, and an application of a legal principle to that interpretation. The who for what -- what the parties actually intended is the arbitrator. That's what the Bazzle plurality, together with Justice Stevens, both decided. The question that arises, the legal question that arises, only if the arbitrators say there was no meeting of the minds: So what rule does the FAA allow us to apply as a matter of Federal law? That is for courts, and you didn't reach it because the preliminary question of whether the contract was really silent, the predicate question, wasn't answered. And you remanded for that --",
  "If it expressly authorized it?",
  "If it expressly authorized class participation, obviously, we would have no argument that the parties had not agreed to it.",
  "My -- I have a --",
  "No, certainly not.",
  "I mean, the only reason -- the only reason I’m hedging -- and I don't mean to hedge, but trying to be thoughtful -- is that this Court explained in Mitsubishi, in the context of the arbitration of a Sherman Act agreement, and subsequently in Gilmer and other statutory cases, that in determining whether class participation or some other form of remedy is or isn't available, there is a two-part inquiry. The first part is: What was the scope of the arbitration agreement? What is it that the parties have agreed --",
  "Then we would have review only under the -- I don't know that I would characterize it this way, but what Justice Breyer characterized, the Marrs standard of review; that is, you would have to show --",
  "-- manifest disregard, and a manifest --",
  "No, our -- and the petition in this case presented the question as given, presented the issue of contract construction as given, that the contract itself was silent, not only in the sense that it didn't include an express provision or prohibition, but also that it reflected no meeting of the minds. It objectively revealed no meeting of the minds, looking not only at the actual text of the contract, but also looking at the other indicia -- objective indicia of intent that courts use to --",
  "The arbitrators were asked to decide whether the arbitration agreement objectively reveals consent to prohibit, permit -- whether it reveals a meeting of the minds to prohibit class treatment, permit class treatment, or whether it was truly silent.",
  "And if you look at --",
  "Well, no, no, no. The parties that -- I mean -- we actually -- let me step back and give -- and give the history of it. This case arose immediately in the wake of Bazzle. Okay? They sued in court; we obtained an order affirmed by the Second Circuit sending them to arbitration. Bazzle is decided, and we’re all looking at Bazzle, and we decide -- like the AAA, which has filed an amicus brief in this case, and said it drafted these rules in order to provide a procedure to answer the Bazzle contract interpretation question; the AAA says, we don't have any view about the statutory question that arises from silence -- so we drafted a supplemental agreement that, in paragraph 7, incorporates the AAA Rules 3 through 7. And the AAA Rule 3, which is included on page 56 of the joint appendix, is headed \"Construction of the Arbitration Clause.\" And it requires the arbitrators in this arbitration to determine, quote, \"on construction of the arbitration clause, whether the applicable arbitration clause permits the arbitration to proceed on behalf of or against a class.\" The, quote, \"clause construction award.\" Now, the legal -- the arbitrators in this case concluded that it neither permitted nor prohibited, either by its express terms or by reference to other objective indicia of intent --",
  "It -- in the context of the Federal Arbitration Act, which this Court has made clear more times than I can remember that the central purpose is to ensure that private agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their terms, the question is: Have the parties agreed to it if there is a meeting of the minds? If no meeting of the minds is objectively revealed, under the FAA, the arbitrator exceeds his authority in requiring class arbitration. It's -- there is no consent. And if there is no consent, the legal rule under -- the hallmark principle of the FAA is this is a private consensual matter. This is not a court exercising public coercive authority. I mean, the --",
  "Correct. He --",
  "Right. I --",
  "They --",
  "Correct. I mean --",
  "So here's was -- here’s what the issue was. They said the contract is completely silent and, as you quoted on page 77, the part -- there's no meeting of the minds on this issue at all. That was their position about the construction of the contract. Our position about the construction of the contract was that, in fact, although there is no express provision one way or the other, this is a maritime contract, and the -- and maritime law is ascertained by custom and practice. And we introduced evidence in the form of affidavits that were unrefuted that since the days of Marco Polo, these types of spot voyages have been --",
  "I don't owe you.",
  "Exactly.",
  "No.",
  "In -- in the -- in the context of -- in the context of a court that has jurisdiction over a dispute and exercises coercive power, it has to get to an answer. When you are talking about private arbitration, where the model is a private agreement to resolve things between two parties, this -- under the FAA, the arbitrators get their authority only as to matters as to which there is consent. And there is -- going to Justice Alito's question, there was consent. It was submitted for purpose of determining whether -- if you look at the contract and look at background rules and look at parol evidence and look at custom and practice, can you discern whether, as -- as you put it in -- in the opinion in Howsam, Justice Breyer, whether the contract, quote, \"objectively reveals an agreement\" by the two parties.",
  "Exactly. And -- and maybe the ambiguity here is the fluidity of the term \"silence.\" \"Silence\" can mean there’s no express provision. \"Silence\" could also mean, well, if you look at other words in the text of the contract, you can't work your way through to conclude that there was in fact an intent. It also may mean -- and this is the sense that I am using it in, and I think the sense that the arbitrators have authority to do, is to say, well, let's look and see, for example, if there is custom and practice that would inform the backdrop against which the parties negotiate.",
  "No, no, no, I think an arbitrator can. The arbitrator has plenary authority, subject to manifest disregard review, to decide whether or not there was a meeting of the minds of the parties. And it can use the text of the statute; it can use an applicable background principle of governing law; it can use principles like contra proferentem, as this Court did in --",
  "They have plenary authority to apply rules of construction that go to the parties' intent, that go to whether there is -- possible to discern a meeting of the minds. They don't have --",
  "Well, I think that courts can -- for example, a court can say -- and the other side relies heavily on a Seventh Circuit opinion by Judge Posner, where he basically says: There is no intent here, but courts apply contract constructions that seem most sensible as a matter of public policy, and that's what we are going to do. That's what a court can do and an arbitrator can't. The arbitrator can use any tools possible, including, largely, the text and custom and practice, in order to define whether or not there was a meeting of the minds. But if there wasn't --",
  "I think it's a radical proposition --",
  "-- as a matter of what courts can do, but it certainly doesn't express what an arbitrator can do. And he was -- he was performing the kind of function, ostensibly, that you said that should be done by an arbitrator in Bazzle. He was doing it as a court. But arbitrators have to construe the agreement itself between the two parties to see if there is a meeting of the minds. And there are lots of tools they can use. And just to get back to your question, Justice Alito --",
  "I'm sorry -- in this case, we said the contract was not truly silent, that -- essentially, we argued what Judge Rakoff concluded. They said: No, no, no; it is truly silent, but you should rule for us on other grounds. And may I please ask the Court, if you have it, to turn to page 22 of our blue brief, because on page 22 of our blue brief we have reprinted exactly what AnimalFeeds told the arbitrators were the reasons why they should win, in light of Mr. Persky's statement that there was no meeting of the minds. And it is the indented paragraph. This is all that they said: \"The parties' arbitration clause should be construed to allow class arbitration because (a) the clause is silent on the issue of class treatment, and without express prohibition, class arbitration is permitted under Bazzle.\" The arbitrator said: No, that's not what Bazzle means. Bazzle doesn't mean that unless there’s an express prohibition, it's -- it's permitted. So that was their reason number one. Let's go to their reason number 3.",
  "They said it in -- pardon me while I get the page. Page 49a: \"Claimants argue that Bazzle requires clear language that forbids class arbitration in order to bar a class action. The panel, however, agrees with Respondents that the test is a more general one. Arbitrators must look to the language of the parties' agreement to ascertain the parties' intention, whether they intended to permit or to preclude class arbitration.\" Now, let's go back to what they told the arbitrators, and it's reprinted on page 22. I am going to skip --",
  "Or was silent.",
  "Well --",
  "No, with -- with respect -- and I’ll -- let me answer this question --",
  "-- before getting back to the -- what that -- what -- look, you -- you may find, contrary to the cert grant in this case, that the predicate of our petition is wrong. Our petition is predicated on the understanding that the arbitrators found that the contract was truly silent; that is, it expressed no meeting of the minds. And, therefore, this case presents the question --",
  "And we know from the arbitrators' decision --",
  "As -- as a background rule, that's what they said. What they said was, they -- first of all -- and we are looking at page 52 -- they acknowledge the force of the argument, quote, \"that the bulk of international shippers would never intend to have their disputes decided in a class arbitration.\" But they said, well, we can deal with that later in deciding whether they can opt in or out. I mean, the point is that if you have to opt in because it's clear that you never agreed, there is no meeting of the minds. Secondly --",
  "Yes.",
  "That is incorrect, with respect. AnimalFeeds doesn't have a class claim. AnimalFeeds has a claim. Its claim is that it paid too much for the contracts that it entered into -- the charter parties -- to ship some sort of oil from Panama to ports around the world. It is -- it was asking a court, and is now asking an arbitrator, to join in the separate claims that other parties to other contracts with other terms --",
  "Exactly. And --",
  "It's -- you know, that argument -- in the JLM case, which is the case in which the Second Circuit, the district court in the Second Circuit said, no, you have to arbitrate this -- their briefs actually made this point. Their briefs said you can't send us to arbitration, because we won't get class treatment in arbitration. And the Second -- the district court in the Second Circuit said you have got to arbitrate according to the terms of your agreement. In footnote 9 of the Second Circuit's opinion –-",
  "They never --",
  "Their claim was we paid too much. And with respect, Justice Ginsburg, your point that they aren't allowed to proceed in class arbitration is no different than the fact that by agreeing to arbitrate this bilateral dispute, the parties agreed to dispense with an appeal and with meaningful judicial review of the things the arbitrators decided.",
  "I will.",
  "I -- I was hoping to reserve a few minutes for rebuttal, but nothing is more important than --",
  "-- than answering the Court's questions. So I think we have dealt with (a). They -- they said (a) we win because Bazzle requires it. The arbitrators correctly said no. I want to skip (b), because my submission is that (b) is what they did. (C) says the clause would be unconscionable and unenforceable if it forbade class arbitration. The panel said: We aren't reaching that; we are not deciding that question. So what's left? The only other argument that AnimalFeeds made was (b): The clause should be construed to permit class arbitration as a matter of public policy. And that is exactly what the arbitrators did. What they said was -- and this is on page 51 of the petition appendix -- they said that if they followed a strict contractual theory, quote, \"There would appear to be no basis for a class action, absent express agreement among all parties and putative class members.\" And they then, lower down on the page, then said that we were required to prove that the parties, quote, \"intended to preclude arbitration.\" That is, they applied a background rule that they thought was desirable from a public policy sense. And our sole submission here, the only question presented in this case, is that that decision is not -- is precluded by the Federal Arbitration Act, which requires that contracts to arbitrate be construed only in accordance with their terms and what the parties agreed with. And section 4 of the Arbitration Act couldn't be clearer that they -- they can only proceed, quote, \"in accordance with the terms of their agreement.\" May I reserve the balance of my time?",
  "Okay. Three points, so I will take 25 seconds for each point. First of all, these contracts in the class are not all the same. These are form contracts that are drafted by the charterers and their brokers, and they involve different clauses, including different arbitration clauses. The second point, the Rule 3, I think, fairly does encapsulate the question that the parties presented to the Court, which is to construe the contract, the question that the Bazzle plurality sent back. The AAA amicus brief in this case, which I commend to the Court, on behalf of no party says over and over and over again, we drafted the rules to provide procedures to answer the Bazzle contract question. We have no opinion about the answer to the Federal statutory question that arises if the answer to the -- the meeting-of-the-minds question is no meeting of the minds as a matter of contract law. And if you find -- and much of the discussion this morning has focused on this -- that, well, somehow the arbitrators did just decide the meeting-of-the-minds question, they didn't decide the legal consequences of no meeting of the minds, then just as in Keating and as in Bazzle, you will not be able to reach the very important, fundamental FAA statutory question in this case. And the next generation of lawyers will come before you or your successors to get it answered. Now, as to the contract question, I do want to address your point, Justice Breyer, about the toolbox. It is true that in answering the contract -- what is -- what did the parties intend? Was there really a meeting of the minds here? And, by the way, let me just say that when Ms. Pillard says, well, we don't know whether the parties in this industry agreed or disagreed, all of the -- the evidence was undisputed that since the days of Marco Polo the background principle in maritime law has been bilateral, rigorously bilateral.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question presented is how to interpret a since-amended version of Regulation Z. In amicus briefs filed, solicited by the First Circuit and by this Court, the Federal Reserve Board has confirmed that it has long interpreted its regulation just as Chase Bank and the rest of the regulated credit card industry understood.",
  "Yes, Justice Kagan?",
  "A lot of the above.",
  "First of all, Auer has been applied in the context of amicus briefs since Christensen and Mead, both -- unanimously both in Kennedy and in Long Island Care at Home. And I must say, in both of those cases, the deference was to a brief that acknowledged a change in the agency's position, which is quite unlike what's going on here.",
  "Nonetheless, I think those cases stand for the proposition that Auer is alive and well. And, in any event, as your question pointed out, both Mead and Christensen and the passage in Christensen that you're referring to dealt with the question of Chevron deference to informal letters from the -- from, you know, a -- somebody who was employed by an administrative agency. And the question in the case, the interpretive question in the case, in the Chevron context, is: What confidence can we have that Congress has, in fact, delegated to the agency interpretive or rulemaking authority in this context? And so, for example, in Mead, the Court distinguished between notice-and-comment regulations that Customs put out, as opposed to the kind of determinations that were made by 46 different offices at the rate of something like 15,000 letters a year. In the -- when Christensen dealt with the Auer question, because it did involve a -- an informal opinion of the Wage and Hour Administrator both interpreting the Fair Labor Standards Act and a regulation, when it came to interpreting the regulation what this Court said is: Our deference doesn't apply here because we read the regulation as clear. And Auer, of course, made clear that deference is due to an agency brief unless it is plainly erroneous or the regulation is clear. Now, here we have a situation in which it is not an agency staff or whatever that is applied. The First Circuit asked the government for -- solicited the Federal Reserve Board itself to explain the meaning of its own regulation. And the brief that was filed represented that it was the longstanding and consistent interpretation of the Federal Reserve Board -­",
  "That's correct. We think that the Federal Reserve Board's reading of the two regulatory provisions is the better reading, but we acknowledge, as every court I think that has -- that has addressed this, that there is some ambiguity, just looking at the regulations. But I think it's important to understand also that the views expressed in the amicus brief solicited by the First Circuit and by this Court are entirely consistent with explanations that the Board, as a Board, provided in the course of a 4-year rulemaking process about what these provisions mean.",
  "I -- I think that if it weren't for the amicus briefs in this case, which are later in time and address the very specific question that is presented in this case, our deference would be appropriate. And it's not just an ANPR. There was the Federal Reserve explanation accompanying the ANPR, a functionally identical explanation accompanying the proposed rule, and one also accompanying the final rule. And those explanations of the Board are entitled to Auer deference. After all, in Anderson Ford, another case involving the construction of Regulation Z, this Court acknowledged that deference was due to a proposed -- the commentary accompanying a proposed change in Regulation Z which had not in fact even been implemented. So -­",
  "I'm sorry? Judge -­",
  "Yes. And in fact, Justice Kennedy, I would say that both the majority and the dissent below referred to the ANPR when -- both when they were referring to the commentary to the ANPR and the commentary to the actual proposed rule in 2007. Now, of course, Judge Cudahy was deciding this before the First Circuit had solicited the views. On rehearing, we urged the Ninth Circuit to solicit the views of the Federal Reserve Board if there were any doubt, because a split had been created, but it declined to do so. And -­",

  "I'm not trying to be flip here. I don't think that there is any inconsistency between Auer and Mead. Mead involved the question of whether or not there was -- the Court could be confident that Congress had delegated some sort of lawmaking function to these letters that were written by Customs officers across the country to individual importers, when the letters themselves made clear that they couldn't be relied on by anybody other than that particular importer and only unless and until the Customs officer changed her mind.",

  "Correct.",
  "Right. As to -- I agree with that. And, as to why we're getting into all this, you know, I had a prepared statement that actually was going off in a different direction.",

  "So I think the -­",
  "That's correct. And I think, you know, to the extent that there's anything more that's needed, it seems to me the icing on the cake here is that the rulemaking that I've been discussing during which over the course of several years the Board engaged in consumer testing, in surveys, in comments, and decided to change its regulation -- it produced as what it called a, quote, \"major change,\" an entirely new section of Regulation Z, 226.9, that establishes as a new requirement what the Respondent in this case erroneously ascribes to the previously unamended text. And that is -­",
  "That's correct, and it's -­",
  "I -- I agree, Justice Sotomayor, that that -- that one of the two changes that the Board made could be characterized and was, in fact, a major change. But if the Court will take note of the pages, the Federal Register record cites that we've provided on page 29, note 7, of our blue brief, and that the Federal Reserve Board's amicus brief in the First Circuit provided at page 12a of the Government's brief, I think you will see that what the Board -- the Board in 2009 was very careful to explain, as it did in 2007, that it was making in this respect two major changes. One is that in those instances in which the contract was being changed, that is a term of the contract was being changed, advance notice of 45 days would be required regardless of what kind of change it was, but that when there was an -- a rate increase, quote, \"due to delinquency, deficiency, or penalty, not due to a change in contractual terms of the consumer's account,\" reference should be made to new subsection (g). And the Federal Reserve Board was very, very clear that it was making two different changes: one to extend the advance notice period with respect to changes in terms from what the original disclosure provided; and another to provide that if you are increasing the rate, even if it is entirely consistent with the initial disclosures, you are required by this new subsection to provide advance notice.",
  "Yes. And now, of course, we're talking about a rule that's -- it had been amended -­",
  "-- amended 2 years ago, but under the old regime the cardholder was on notice -- I mean, there had to be -- and the Reg Z commentary was clear that in order for it to be a default rate, it had to specify in the initial disclosures both the precise triggering event, that is, what constitutes a default -­ and here there's no doubt that it was specified that what constitutes a default is a default or failure to make a payment to any creditor -- and there also has to be a specification of the maximum rate that could be applied as a result. Now, in this case, as the Board explained, the -- the consumer would be notified in the next monthly statement -- and it is pretty prominent -- that the interest rate applied to all balances for that month was as follows. May I save the balance of my time?",
  "Oh, gosh, I hope I have this right. Oh, no. I'm sorry. It's footnote 7 on page 29 of our petition.",
  "May it please the Court: Just three small points. My interest was piqued when Justice Breyer said that he acknowledged that he may have no idea what he was talking about in -­ with respect to a reservation of rights. And I just want to be clear that reservation of rights clauses, which are also referred to as change-in-terms clauses, are ubiquitous in these -- in contracts and initial disclosures. They are a term of art, as the Board has recognized. And what they are is simply a statement by the credit card issuer in a consumer open-credit account arrangement that, you know, it may decide to change any term in any respect at any time. And the Board's regulations make clear that if you do that, that is if you implement a change in terms pursuant to a reservation of rights clause, you have to provide notice. Now, the specific -- what \"specific\" means in the commentary to the regulation, which is a question that Justice Kagan asked, it seems to me was absolutely explained by the Board in a 1998 amendment to Regulation Z, which is comment 6(a)(2)-11, which is reprinted in relevant part on page A of our blue brief. This really is in our blue brief.",
  "Page 8.",
  "Correct. You have to -- I mean, what it says -- and I'm quoting from, like, four-fifths of the way down page 8 -- quote: \"If the initial rate may increase upon the occurrence of one or more specific events, such as a late payment or an extension of credit that exceeds the credit limit, the creditor must disclose the initial rate and the increased penalty rate that may apply.\" And this was an amendment in 1998 that the Board made to Reg Z in what it recognized, what it stated was on account of the increased use of default penalty terms in the initial disclosures, that it wanted to make clear that if both the triggering event and the maximum rate was specified, there would be no change in terms if an increased rate were implemented. And finally, I just want to address my friend's point that there may be some question about whether TILA even authorizes the Board's explanation of the type of subsequent disclosure that was or wasn't required and underscore Mr. Palmore's observation that in TILA until 2009, there was a requirement for initial disclosures, there was a requirement for periodic statements, but nothing at all about subsequent disclosures. Thank you.",

It's legal, for example, because there are lots of legal questions built into the unable-to-comply defense, including what it means to be unable to comply.

So, I think we would still -- even if the burden had shifted, the broader rule we're asking for is, look, the -- here the State is sending a man to jail repeatedly on the premise of exacting compliance with court orders and on the theory that he holds the keys to his own pocket because he can always choose to comply.

I mean, I suppose the closest second would be what Justice Powell, providing the fifth vote in Vitek, provided, which is even in that case where the decision was being made by a mental health professional and the issue involved the transfer from somebody in State prison to a State mental unit, a much diminished liberty interest -- even Justice Powell, providing the fifth vote, said, well, in light of the nature of the decision being made and the decision-making body, I wouldn't always require counsel -­",

  "Justice Scalia, if I had such a case, it would have appeared quite prominently in my brief. There is no such case, but let me make two points about history and what the Due Process Clause means, notwithstanding what some of us might like it to mean. First of all, history -- the history is very, very complicated, and it doesn't dictate the answer. The traditional distinction along the lines was not between civil or criminal contempt, but direct or indirect contempt, and as I know Your Honor knows because you've written it, traditionally at common law, I mean, counsel was provided for civil cases and in misdemeanor cases, but not felony cases. The criminal/civil distinction in contempt arose in this Court around the turn of the 20th century, and it arose so that the courts could exercise more supervisory review over the imposition of criminal contempt by courts. Now, in Cooke and Oliver, this Court, as I said, long, long before it recognized that criminal contempt was a Sixth -- a crime entitled to all Sixth Amendment protections, held that because of the nature of the deprivation of liberty, the appointment of counsel was required. And our submission here is, as this Court has recognized, the distinction between civil and criminal contempt is the question of whether you have coercive imprisonment or imprisonment as punishment. And in almost every case, the sentence involves some aspect of both, and where the only thing, the only thing, that keeps the coercive imprisonment from being unconstitutionally punitive absent a jury trial right and proof beyond a reasonable doubt and counsel, is the ability to comply with the court's order. And that burden is put on the defendant, even though it is the State's burden to prove willfulness, due -­",

This Court has already said that, in civil contempt proceedings, there is no requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and there is no requirement of proof of a jury trial, just as following Gault, this Court said there is no requirement of a jury trial in a juvenile commitment case.",
  "It wasn't wrong, Justice Scalia, and as we've pointed out, the majority of States and all seven circuits that have spoken to this question have all held that there is, in fact, a right to appointed counsel before the State in an -- in an assertedly civil contempt proceeding can deprive a human being of his liberty.",

  "I have three points. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. First of all, I mean this -- the crux of this dispute comes down to whether this is some -- akin to some sort of simple form that can be filled out that any layperson, no matter how uneducated, can deal with. Second, the question is how much of a burden is this going to be on the States? And, third, the question of whether or not what counsel suggests as the Utah model or what he denigrates as the New Jersey model would be a way to square this circle. First of all, counsel says he can't conceive of a legal issue that can arise in this case. Let's just look at this case as an example. There was allegations of -- an admission of drug use. Does or does that not constitute an inability to pay? That is a legal question. It is not a factual question. Inability to comply is a legal defense, not a factual excuse. The allegation was he's not employed, but maybe he's not looking for work or he's underemployed. Is that inability to comply for purposes of a coercive contempt sanction? That is a legal question. Our suggestion is he could be incarcerated so that he could be placed on work release in a county jail program and reduce his arrearage. Is that or is that not a permissible application of a coercive sanction of incarceration? The cases that we've seen have said no, but it is an open legal question. Even as to the marshaling of evidence, it is his burden not to just say, oh, I can't pay. He submitted a form that he filed for his disability payments that said I have no income and I have a car that's worth $1,500. Did he have to pay that car -­ sell the car to pay or not?

In terms of burden, the State is paying -­ there are approximately 15 percent of the State's jail population in any given year that are noncustodial parents that are serving terms, in this case two 6-month terms and a year term, at the cost -- according to the statistics, at the cost of between 13- and 17,000 dollars a year. South Carolina, because it refuses to comply with the requirements of the Federal program, has already paid $72 million to the government in fines and owes another 10. And if you want to really reduce the cost, Justice Kennedy, and make this manageable, take the system that they are applauding in Utah or denigrating in New Jersey.

  "The long-settled, clear and convincing evidence standard is correct, one, as a matter of statutory interpretation, two, as a matter of stare decisis in a field in which stability is particularly important, and, three, as a matter of first principles. As to one, in 1952 Congress codified a long, uniform line of decisions from this Court holding that the presumption of validity imposes a heightened burden of proof, a burden of proof that this Court in RCA unanimously described as, quote, \"clear and cogent evidence.\" And for the past 28 years Congress has actively acquiesced in the Federal Circuit's consistent holding expressly drawn from RCA that the standard is \"clear and convincing.\"",
  "I thought that might get a rise out of you.",
  "I hope I'll get a chance to go to first principles, but having made that provocative statement, the point is -­",
  "I may want to submit a supplemental brief on that point.",
  "What I mean to say is that this is not a statute that Congress enacted and then forgot about. This is a statute in which beginning in 1980, even before the Federal Circuit was created, Congress started amending the law to address the problem of low-quality patents, with the first re-examination procedure in 1980, any number of amendments, including to section 282, the creation of interparties re-examination in 1999, and the current consideration of a post-grant review process. So Congress has been very, very active in this field, and what I mean by active acquiescence is it has been very active in this field, it is well aware of the clear and convincing evidence standard, and it has done nothing whatsoever to change it, even make any effort to consider making such a sweeping change in long-standing doctrine.",
  "Well, as to presumptions generally, I found particularly persuasive your opinion for the Third Circuit in GI Holding. But more -­",
  "More directly to the point, and with all due deference to the sensibilities of the presiding Justice for this argument, when Congress enacted section 282 in 1952, the revisers note the House Committee report, the Senate committee report said that they were, quote, \"codifying the existing presumption of patent validity,\" and this Court had unanimously said -­ and this is language from RCA that Microsoft does not address -- on page 2 of its opinion says, quote, \"even for the purpose of a controversy of -- with strangers there is a presumption of validity, a presumption not to be overthrown except by clear and cogent evidence. Now, to be sure, that was dicta in the sense that the case in itself involves a priority issue. But it was the holding of the Court 3 years later in Smith v. Hall; it was repeated on the very same day in Mumm, and it was -- the Court spent an entire page, I think page 7, the better part of page 7 and 8 of its opinion, explaining that -- enunciating a general principle of the law, and it would be a cruel joke on Congress to have said, we are, when it said we are codifying the existing presumption, that that presumption was not exactly what the Supreme -- the Supreme Court unanimously had said, which is a presumption not to be overthrown by clear and convincing evidence. Now, that's -- it's not that the first sentence uses the word presumption. It uses the word essentially presumption of patent validity, which is a feature, a uniform feature of the Supreme Court's jurisprudence since the Court first started addressing this issue in 1873, and indeed when Justice Story first decided the Washburn v. Gould case, there is -- their argument is the standard is a preponderance. There is not one opinion, there is not one sentence, there is not one phrase in any of this Court's line of decisions that supports that proposition -- and when Judge Rich said in 19 -- shortly after 1952 that there was some disarray in the courts' opinions, he was -- and you can look at his opinion in context. He was talking about lower court decisions that had either ignored or misinterpreted this Court's very clear holdings -- holdings which, by the way, refute not only their argument for a universal standard, preponderance standard, but directly refute their argument that there somehow is some other standard of proof that applies with respect to evidence that assertedly was not before the Patent Office. That was true of most of this Court's cases decided before RCA, and for that matter after RCA.",
  "Yes, and the Federal Circuit has said that over and over and over again. I mean, I'm going to quibble with the word \"would\" because I think the actual language of the instruction can't invade the province of the jury. But you could -- certainly could say that the defendant contends that the patent is invalid because the law presumes that a patent issued by the PTO is valid, the defendant bears the burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing evidence, and in deciding whether the defendant has met that burden, you may find it more easily met with evidence that you conclude the Patent Office did not consider in evaluating patentability. That is the long-standing established rule of the Federal Circuit. It was stated, as was recognized in American Hoist, in 1984, and the explanation for it, Judge Rich's explanation is exactly the same in cite that this Court's statement's in KSR is, which is that there -- there are -- there are reasons independent of deference to a particular PTO decision that warrant a clear and convincing evidence standard, and -- and this is key -- there is no case from this Court, to my knowledge, in Anglo-American jurisprudence, that creates or sanctions a regime in which there are different standards of proof with respect to a particular issue that a jury has to decide. The question -- when there is -­",
  "Well, there -- are you referring to cases of this Court?",
  "Well, okay. I'm -- I'm talking here about -- the argument here is about the standard of proof, that is, a jury has to be instructed is it beyond a reasonable doubt, is it preponderance, is it clear and convincing? I'm not aware of any instance in Anglo-American jurisprudence, and certainly Microsoft and its amici have not cited one in which the jury is told that depending on the weight you ascribe to the evidence you heard, you should apply a different standard of proof. The issue goes to the weight of the evidence. I mean, imagine a case in -- a regime in which you said, well, you've heard eyewitness testimony. If you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, find that the eyewitness really had an unimpeded view, the standard is preponderance, but if you think that the view was impeded or obscured, the standard is clear and convincing evidence. The -- the assertion that there was evidence that the jury -- that the PTO didn't hear, and as the briefs point out it is far from black and white what the PTO does or doesn't consider. And in addition the -­ it's far from clear whether the unconsidered evidence is, quote, more pertinent than evidence that was considered. Even assuming that, the jury is told, for reasons of first principles, that I will articulate in a moment if left to my own devices, that the burden of proof is clear and convincing evidence, but you may find that burden more easily met if you find that there was, in fact, evidence relating to validity that was not, in fact, considered by the PTO when it issued this property right. Now, the first -­",
  "The -­",
  "Well, I mean, a lot -­",
  "There -- there are -- there are any number of formulations that trial courts have given. I think the one that would be clearest would be one that says in deciding whether the defendant has met his burden, you may give added weight to evidence that you find the PTO didn't consider in deciding validity. The case I think you're referring to was Microsoft's earlier case involving z4, where unlike this case, Microsoft did ask for an instruction but it was rejected by the court -- it was -- it was rejected by the court and found not to be an abuse of discretion. The key point with respect to that instruction goes to the articulation that was suggested earlier, because in that case the instruction said you -- you make -- I instruct -- I don't have it in front of me, but it was essentially a mandatory instruction to give greater weight or that the burden would be more easily met.",
  "Well -­",
  "There is a -- there is a great difference, Justice Scalia, between telling individual jurors what amount of weight they may or may not give to certain evidence in creating a dual standard of proof which would, for reasons that -- that Microsoft's own amici point out, requires -- would require the jury first to determine whether this evidence was or wasn't considered and was or wasn't more pertinent -­",
  "Justice Scalia, as -- as I think all the parties agree, and we reflect the -- we reflect the -- the research, I believe, on footnote 12 of our brief, the -- this point is argued in many, many, many cases. That is -- and it was true in this case. Evidence is put on that the jury -- that the PTO didn't consider this particular prior art, although, you know, in this case the file wrapper shows that there were five prior art rejections based on other art before the patent was allowed, and counsel argue it to and fro to the jury, as the Allison and Lemley article points out, the statistics bear out the common sense, which is that juries are, in fact, very influenced by the fact that there was art going to or questioning validity that was not considered by the PTO. In other words, the instruction, whether the instruction is necessary or not, juries get it, and juries apply it. What they're not required to do is apply two different standards of proof following all sorts of predicate determinations that they would have to make. May I simply list the first -- the first -­",
  "There -- here are four independent principles that justify the clear and convincing evidence standard across the board regardless of what the jury considered. Number one, an infringer's validity challenge is a collateral attack on a government decision that has already been made, quite unlike Grogan and Huddleston, that bestows property rights by written instrument. Number two, the harm from an erroneous determination is hugely asymmetrical. A single holding of invalidity by a single lay jury vitiates for all time the patent and all of the reliance interest by the inventor and the investors and the licensees who have relied upon that ex ante. Third, this grant of property rights not only induces reliance, which lack, like the land patent cases induce reliance, this is a grant of a property right that under the Constitution is specifically designed to induce reliance in exchange for the inventor's honoring her half of the patent bargain, that is public disclosure of her intellectual property for the public benefit, and the commitment of capital by investors and licensees that's necessary to bring into fruition for the public benefit.",
  "Yes, and the fact -- yes, the re-examine system -- I think your point actually, I wish I had thought to make this point myself. Re-examine is often invoked by the patent holder. That is, because re-exam is done by the expert agency and allows the patent -- allows the agency not to have a binary choice of yes, the patent's fine or no, it's invalid for all time, but can narrow the scope of the patent in re-exam, many re-exams are requested by the patent holder. And more -- and also, when you request re-examination or when the PTO makes a re-exam decision, that decision is good for all time, whichever way it goes, unlike the stark asymmetry in trial court litigation where the patent holder has to win 100 percent of the time. If the patent holder loses once, the patent under nonmutual offensive collateral estoppel, Blonder-Tongue, the patent is out. And I should point out that this Court's opinion in Blonder-Tongue, which of course was a case about patent validity -­",

  "Excuse me? No, the fact that -- the fact that it's a collateral challenge on a government decision bestowing property rights by written instrument, no. The fact that the harm from an erroneous decision is totally asymmetrical, no. The fact that what Congress intended was that this grant of property rights actually induced reliance, and finally -- and this is my final first principle, I suppose -- that changing this long-standing standard would marginalize the PTO, the expert agency that we know Congress created to superintend the issuance and re-examination of patents, and to the extent that there are significant policy concerns which I agree with -­ may I finish my sentence?",

  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals held that it was an abuse of discretion to deny substitution without making any inquiry, even of counsel, into the specific situation alleged by Mr. Clair. The court did not hold that Mr. Clair was entitled to substitute counsel. It did not hold that he was entitled to amend his petition. It did not hold that substitute counsel was even required or advised to seek --",
  "I think if you have any obligation whatsoever -- and I want to make clear that there -- these kinds of letters and requests for last-minute substitutions happen all the time, and in the mine run, there may not be any duty of independent inquiry. If you had one, it would simply be to do what the court did in March, which is to inquire of the two counsel in the case, is there anything to this, and then rule.",
  "No --",
  "No, of course not. In this situation, the Court had pending before it a first petition for habeas corpus that alleged both ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and specific Brady violations. And, by the way, in answer to your first question, the district judge announced that he was retiring on June 27th, effective the 30th.",
  "So, this was beforehand.",
  "No.",
  "The -- the significance of the fact that he -- he hadn't announced that he was going to retire. The significance of the fact that he did retire is only to my mind an explanation for why he failed to conduct the minimal inquiry --",

  "Because -- it goes to their complaints with the remedy in the case. That is, they're faulting that the remedy is not go back and ask this judge to decide whether substitution was appropriate.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, I -- I apologize if it gave that impression. I don't mean any innuendo in the case. Our proposition is simply this: Prior to adjudicating the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and Brady, when the court receives a letter that says, Your Honor, I'm sorry for writing a second time. As you know, I have always maintained that I'm innocent. My investigator has just discovered physical evidence in the State's files that he believes may clear me. My counsel --",
  "It goes to the remedy, and it goes to the fact he --",
  "It -- they are alleging that there was an abuse of discretion not to send it back to the judge to do what he had declined to do. And our proposition is, because substitute counsel had been in place for 5 years and because the judge who had superintended the case for 12 years was no longer there, it was appropriate and within the court of appeals' discretion under 28 U.S.C. 2106 to remand it to the new judge, with new counsel, for -- to allow new counsel simply to ask the new judge, who had not heard all of the witnesses or the evidence, to demonstrate why, if counsel thought it was appropriate, to allow him to amend the petition under Rule 15(a)(2).",
  "Well, this -- it may very well be what was in his thought processes, but we don't know that. And, in any event --",
  "Oh, I -- I think that the -- that a district judge faced with a request to substitute counsel at this very late stage is appropriately -- appropriately takes into account everything that has happened, everything that he has allowed to happen, everything that defense counsel has -- has done. And he is obviously permitted to approach this request with a high degree of skepticism and a strong --",
  "That's right. I mean --",
  "Well, of course --",
  "I think, you know, if the district judge is presented with factually supported allegations that appointed counsel has failed to pursue newly discovered evidence that may be germane to an issue to be decided, especially where the potential import of that evidence is specifically explicated and corroborated by a willing percipient witness, in this case the investigator who viewed it, the district judge has an obligation simply to ask counsel for the State and counsel for the defense, please respond, as the judge did in June -- in March. Now, in March, the judge -- the judge asked for a response --",
  "Well, because the judge could not know that based on the allegations in the Ford letter and the Clair letter. It is not the case, going to Justice Alito's point from my question to my friend, that what was represented in that letter, the new physical evidence related only to DNA testing. There was a specific allegation that there were fingerprints located at the scene of the crime that previously had been represented to the trial court and to defense counsel either to be unusable or on materials that had gone through the U.S. mail so that the probative value would be limited. And both of those things were untrue. And Mr. Ford said to the judge: I'm prepared to explain to you exactly what those prints are, and they have not been tested against anyone, including the other people who were suspected of the identical type murder the night before in the same area or other potential suspects in this case like Mr. Henriksen.",
  "Yes. They were --",

  "-- and face the very --",
  "No. While the appeal was pending, so that he wouldn't be accused of having simply sat on his rights while the Ninth Circuit was deciding, he filed a Rule 60 -- he filed for leave to file a Rule 60(b) motion and said in essence: Look, the investigator has discovered this new evidence. I haven't been able to test it or examine it. Please give me leave to do that, because I believe it may support reopening the judgment. The district judge said: I'm not going to allow you to make that motion. The Ninth Circuit issued a mandamus directing the district judge to rule on the motion. She then denied it, essentially finding that the motion should be denied because Mr. Grele, substitute counsel, hadn't already proven to her what it is that he was seeking to find out; that is, what does this evidence show. And --",
  "Yes, I --",
  "I have an answer to your question, but, of course, I'll defer to any superseding questions from --",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "Yes.",
  "No, of course --",
  "Of course not. I mean, even the State acknowledges that asking the judge whether or not there should be substitution when there has been substituted counsel since the appeal was taken is, as they call it, an academic exercise. But, technically, the judge --",
  "Well --",
  "Right. I guess --",
  "I guess -- I'm not sure there's a huge difference between that and what the Ninth Circuit did or what I understand the Ninth Circuit to be doing, which was to issue an order -- basically say the substitution motion had to be decided within the broad discretion that the law allows before entry of judgment. I'm going -- we're going to do as best we can to put Mr. Clair back in that position. It seems to us that since he -- since counsel said, represented, as soon as it was asked after his letter, there's an irreconcilable breakdown and substitution is advised --",
  "-- he has counsel and -- I'm sorry.",
  "Yes, I do have an answer to Justice Breyer's question, if I can just -- thank you. If I can just finish answering -- I apologize for my lengthy answers.",
  "Thank you. In essence what has happened -- what I understand the court of appeals to have decided is to say, look, because we have had substitute counsel for 5 years and the FPD has said it couldn't continue, we're allowing this to go back and let substitute counsel convince the judge, if it can, if it chooses to, whether or not to exercise its considerable discretion in allowing leave to amend the petition before judgment. The judge may very well say no, and the case is then back before us. But it might say yes. In other words, to do what in essence is the prejudice or materiality inquiry that Judge Taylor would have engaged in if he found that there was a breakdown. I mean, if there's a breakdown and the judge says the only new evidence is that the moon was in the fifth house and that doesn't depend on anything, I'm denying -- or it was a new moon, I'm denying this. Justice Breyer, I -- I agree with you that the Ninth Circuit was struggling to figure out a way to most efficiently resolve the multiple appeals that were pending in front of them. And they understood from the Rule 60(b) appeal that was also pending and from the appeal on the denial of substitution that there was this newly discovered evidence in the State's files, that the investigator who looked at it thought that it was really important; and they had no record about what it was or whether it should have been considered. Now, they could have said, well, we're going to direct the Rule 60(b) judge to grant leave to examine the physical evidence and analyze it. And it was an abuse of discretion of the Rule 60(b) judge not to allow Mr. Clair at least to make some showing.",
  "But the more straightforward way would have been to say you didn't inquire of counsel; counsel may have had a very good reason for not pursuing this; but in the face of a specific allegation by a willing, percipient witness that there is highly material evidence in the State's files and the public defender is refusing to do anything about it, all we think the Ninth Circuit was holding is --",
  "-- it was an abuse of discretion not to ask. I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.",
  "Yes.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, if that had -- if the judge had inquired of counsel and counsel had given that reason, that would be something that the court could evaluate in deciding whether the balancing test that is required by the interests of justice standard satisfied his inquiry. But we don't have any -- I doubt very much that that is what counsel would have said.",
  "I would think that that -- not only that goes into the calculus, but all of the, I would say, well-articulated doctrines that Congress and this Court have applied essentially establishing presumptions against reopening long-litigated matters, whether --",
  "All of those things go into the interests of justice balancing. There's no doubt about it.",
  "Of course.",
  "Of course not. The only point is what -- what Clair was basically saying is: My investigator has just found evidence that he believes is highly exculpatory, physical evidence in the State's files that was previously represented not to exist. My counsel is refusing to do anything about it. Please give me somebody, whether it's -- have my counsel do it or some new counsel, to present this to the judge, just so the judge can decide --",
  "-- in evaluating these -- the Brady and the ineffective assistance claim, and if this is as represented, it could be highly material to those claims.",
  "Well, I think that in a -- if substitute counsel -- if there is a remand in this case and substitute counsel makes a Rule 15 motion, the court will evaluate that under the broad interests of justice standard. I mean, whoever the counsel is has to acquit his or her professional obligations. It may very well have been, Mr. Chief Justice, that if Judge Taylor had said, look, I -- please, you know, write to me in 3 days or let's have a status conference and explain to me what's going on; I understand you went to see this evidence; why aren't you -- is it true that you're not pursuing it; and if so, why not -- that would have completely acquitted the judge's responsibility.",
  "Well, I don't think it's strange, Justice Scalia, and let me explain at least my own reaction to this. 3599, the mandatory appointment requirement, was cleaved from what is now 3006, the discretionary appointment, where Congress said in the Controlled Substances Act, look, in death cases, at trial and in habeas, we're not -- we don't want to leave it to the court's or the magistrate's discretion whether or not to appoint. We are appointing. And when it did so -- I mean, it is in essence a -- a progeny -- I mean, it is -- it is a cleaving of what was a discretionary obligation. Congress -- Congress had no need in 3599 to reiterate the language in 3006A(c), which itself is not limited to appointments under 3006A(c). I'm reading from page 95 of the petition appendix. The statute says -- I'm sorry. It's page 93. That the interests of justice standard says this -- and I'm -- it's the last sentence on page 93a. \"The United States magistrate judge or the court may, in the interests of justice, substitute one appointed counsel for another at any stage of the proceedings.\" It doesn't say \"counsel appointed under the discretionary authority of 3006.\" It, like the rest of subsection (c) of which it is a part, is a general rule for duration and substitution of appointments. So, even if it were not true that the sentence itself applied a force, it's, I think, only consistent with what Congress's manifest intention in enacting -- what became 3599(e) to permit that when substitution is requested, that motion be adjudicated in light of the interests of justice. And, indeed, that's what the State told Judge Taylor the standard was in this very case. I mean, look at it this way, Justice Scalia: Imagine that a district court -- I realize that the cases will be few and far between, very few and very far between, where at a late stage of the proceedings, the court will interject substitution of counsel over the State's opposition and over the court's understandable desire to serve the public interest in efficiently and fairly adjudicating motions. But in the rare case where the district judge says, gee, I think the public interest -- I think that the interests of justice really would support putting somebody else in here, but I can't because it doesn't fit within one of the three boxes of the tests that the State ex nihilo has announced in its merits brief in this Court -- it's just impossible to imagine that Congress would have wanted a judge to say, gee, this is one of these one in a million cases where the interests of justice really requires it, but I can't do it.",
  "I mean, we don't -- we're not really arguing about the standard one way or the other. The point -- the only real question in this case is whether whatever the standard is -- and we think it has to be something like interests of justice -- a judge in this particular situation with respect to this particular set of circumstances, there is -- and my investigator, a willing percipient witness, has gone to the police station and found evidence that he believes may well clear me --",
  "-- it requires at a minimum that the judge say --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Well, first of all, the other evidence in this -- the case against Mr. Clair in essence was the wired statement that he made. And even the trial judge in this case said only of that equivocal statement that it was, quote, \"capable of being regarded as an admission.\" Now, we don't disagree with that. We're not --",
  "Well, I think the answer -- I know how frustrating this is, but I think the answer is to both -- is yes to both scenarios, particularly because there was no physical evidence linking him, and really the State's case boiled down to this pretty confusing statement. It was particularly salient to say wait a minute. I mean, the -- the district judge had no idea that there was any dispute about physical evidence, or any physical evidence was in the State's files that hadn't been disclosed and hadn't been tested.",
  "Justice Alito, I mean, we're, of course, all arguing in a vacuum here because we don't know what the fingerprint evidence, if it were tested and run against databases, would show. But let me give you one not at all far-fetched example: The State had -- the county coroner had determined that because of the extraordinary similarity between the murder of a woman in the neighborhood -- very close by the night before and this one, including the very peculiar puncture injuries, the coroner's report in the State's file said this is very likely the same perpetrator. The State has identified the perpetrator of that other crime. And we don't know whether even at this day the State has matched that perpetrator's fingerprints with the fingerprints that were discovered next to the victim in this case. And it wouldn't be far-fetched to say that in a case involving either Brady -- may I finish? It will just be this sentence. Brady or ineffective assistance of counsel, if the fingerprint evidence did link up in that way, it certainly would go into the habeas judge's evaluation of the merits of those claims.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When the issue is the content-based regulation of speech, it is the government, not the speaker, that must steer, quote, \"far wide of the prohibited zone.\" That foundational principle is nowhere in evidence in the FCC's current enforcement regime, which not only intrudes into the prohibited zone but also enforces the indecency ban in a starkly inconsistent manner. A regime in which government officials decide years after the fact that 7 seconds of rear nudity in this particular episode of \"NYPD Blue\" is indecent, but 40 seconds of nudity including full frontal nudity in \"Catch-22\" is not; that expletives in a documentary about blues musicians is indecent, but even more of those expletives in a fictional movie about World War II is not, is constitutionally intolerable.",
  "On -- quite the contrary. This Court made clear, in particularly Justice Powell's concurrence in Pacifica, that context is all-important. And just look at this case. Despite -- and this goes directly to some of these questions about nudity. Despite decades of denying complaints about televised nudity, the commission chose this case for the first time to sanction nudity on television in a serious drama that had been on for 10 years, that had featured over the --",
  "It's not --",
  "Just --",

  "Well, number -- yes. Number one, it is not a reasonable view for reasons that I'll explain. It was not sexual awakening. This was the portrayal in the context of a story line about the -- the difficulties and embarrassments of blended families. This was an exploration of one of the things that happens, which is a little boy stumbles in and watches a woman in the quotidian activity of preparing her morning shower. In any event, the commission for years had been adjudicating complaints about nudity, and I -- I --",
  "It is simply untrue -- it is simply untrue that this had never occurred before. \"NYPD Blue\" itself was in its 10th season. The very first episode, which caused a lot of media attention, included a nude scene of love making. It was the subject of any number of complaints.",
  "Okay.",
  "You're welcome.",
  "I think so.",
  "And if not, I -- I hope you'll tell me. First of all, the -- the -- both First Amendment and Fifth Amendment issues were fully argued in front of the commission, and the commission addressed them in its decision in the ABC case. We, of course, didn't ask the -- suggest to the commission that it should no longer apply Pacifica because the factual predicates for more relaxed scrutiny didn't apply, as we didn't in the Second Circuit, because only this Court can reconsider the application of that standard. So, that's an argument we're making here. That argument is not necessary to resolving this case, either on First or Fifth Amendment grounds. This broadcast -- and particularly in light of the ubiquitous V-chip, this broadcast is not actionably indecent under Pacifica, number one. With respect to notice or the vagueness of the application to this show, clearly this was a shot out of the blue. The commission cannot identify -- I challenge the commission to identify a single decision of the commission issued before this was broadcast in 2003 in which it had sanctioned any display of nudity, and I'm going all the way back to 1978.",
  "Yes, yes, yes. Yes, sanctioned in the \"ouch\" sense.",
  "Well, for -- I don't -- I can't tell you, but I can tell you based on --",
  "Well, I -- I think it's a powerful argument. Let me explain the ones that I know of. 1978, the commission's decision in WGBH, which complained about scenes of explicit nudity in \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\": Denied. \"Catch-22,\" 40 seconds of nudity, including 10 seconds of full frontal female nudity: Denied. The four or five decisions that we -- that we discuss on page 18 of our brief and that are appended to the merits brief of the ABC affiliates. I can't remember whether it's 12 or 16, but more than a dozen episodes of \"NYPD Blue\" itself that included displays, graphic displays, of nudity during the prior nine seasons -- complained about and not adjudicated. That is the backdrop against which the --",
  "Well, first of all, we don't have television broadcasts over 85 years, and since there were no reported decisions of any indecency enforcement until Pacifica, I think it's only fair, as you pointed out yourself, to look at what the commission has been addressing. They're right now -- I mean, you know, I've cited the ones that are the subject of commission decisions. I haven't cited the -- I haven't attempted to hypothesize about all the other instances, but let's just look at what's at stake here because the issue, Justice Breyer, is not just notice to ABC in this case. The question is whether the standards -- the commission's standards as it's currently applying them are so vague and capacious that they not only permit arbitrary action, but they are engaging in arbitrary action. Right now, as -- as Mr. Phillips suggested, the commission has pending before it, which it has not denied for years, complaints about the opening episode of the last Olympics, which included a -- a statue very much like some of the statues that are here in this courtroom, that had bare breasts and buttocks. It -- it has refused to say that “Catch 22” -- its \"Catch\" – right over here, Justice Scalia.",
  "Well, there's a bare buttock there, and there's a bare buttock here. And there may be more that I hadn't seen. But, frankly, I had never focused on it before. But the point --",
  "Could -- could ABC or anybody else rebroadcast the \"Roots\" series? Could it rebroadcast \"Catch-22,\" which the commission is now here saying, oh, no, no, no, that was just our staff; that wasn't us. In the \"Saving Private Ryan\" context, where the commission did say as a commission, not actionably indecent.",
  "No.",
  "In our brief --",
  "-- we don't suggest what the rule ought --",
  "-- ought to be, because (a) it's not our burden; (b) it's not yours; and (c) there are any number of options.",
  "Sure.",
  "Well, those rules certainly would apply. And before I --",
  "No, no, no, no, no. I'm not suggesting that the indecency proscription in the statute cannot be applied in a constitutional way. I can give you four different --",
  "No. Our -- our arbitrariness argument is that we now have a standard that employs nonexclusive factors that use capacious, vague words that can be balanced any way the commission wants to, without explanation for what all the factors are.",
  "It certainly is not. And I can offer the Court or perhaps the commission four approaches it could take to reduce the astonishing vagueness of the current --",
  "I don't know the pages. Let me just -- I can't remember the pages. Let me just outline what I think -- four different things that could ameliorate the vagueness of the current regime. First of all, the FCC could revert back to it's, quote, \"emphatically narrow enforcement regime,\" which acknowledged, one, that it had to defer to reasonable judgments of the broadcasters, and not exercise the -- an editorial eye looking at camera angles, whether something was or wasn't necessary to the message. Number two --",
  "Well, I --",
  "I'm not owning Nicole Richie, and I think the best answer to the Nicole Richie point is that there is a scienter requirement in the statute that, you know, would preclude the application to a good-faith effort. But let me just --",
  "I'll just go back. Well, no -- there are three parts to number one.",
  "I'm not -- I'm not being --",
  "Okay. The first one is to revert back to the prior enforcement regime that existed before 2004, which deferred to reasonable judgments, was restricted to material that is not momentary exposure but is dwelled upon, and that, as Pacifica explained, was egregious material akin to depictions of erotic activity. The second thing they could do is make this three-factor test -- or however many factors it is -- a test, not just a nonexclusive list of an infinite number of factors that could or couldn't be balanced in any way the commission wants to. Even if it wants to leave it as factors -- and this is number three -- it could at least identify what they are and apply them consistency -- consistently through adjudication that explains why one over-balances the other, which it certainly did not do in this case. And it also could clean up the actual form of the words that it uses, referring, for example, to sexually explicit or excretory activity. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our case is about whether the claim of liability is, in a fundamental sense, class-wide or individual. The heart of a 10b-5 claim is I bought or sold in reliance on a misleading statement. The question at the class cert stage is whether each individual will have to prove his own reliance directly on the statement, or whether every -- he can prove indirectly reliance on the statement by showing that everybody relied on a distorted market price. A market price will reflect a statement if and only if the statement is material and is made publicly on an efficient market. So, absent materiality, the market price cannot be presumed to reflect the statement in question. And the plaintiffs - -",
  "That's exactly correct. And the point here is --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, every one of the four predicates to the fraud-on-the-market theory, which is a shortcut that -- that excuses plaintiffs from proving that I heard the statement and relied on it -- every one of those predicates is common. Whether the market is efficient is common. Whether the statement is public is common. Whether the stocks were bought and sold during the period of market distortion is common. And materiality is common. The question is not whether --",
  "The falsity of the statement is common, but it is not a predicate to whether or not you can prove reliance on a statement indirectly by relying on the integrity of the market price because, in an efficient market, material public statements, whether they are true or false, will presumably move the market price. And if you're trying to prove reliance on a false --",
  "Sure. I'm not arguing --",
  "Yes. Either way. Let me explain why. There's no doubt that this Court's standard for materiality, announced in TSC v. Northway and since reiterated, is an objective standard. It doesn't depend on who the relier was. But the inability to prove to a certifying judge that class-wide reliance can be -- that class-wide reliance exists because the statement was material doesn't preclude a plaintiff like Connecticut Retirement, which has said it's going to proceed whether there's a class or not, or any other member of the class, from coming to court and saying, either, I directly relied on this statement, and here's my proof that it's material to the trier-of-fact, because the decision that the judge makes at certification is not binding on the trier-of-fact; or even to say, I relied on the integrity of the market price, and I have proof that the market price was affected because here are three investors, they're all reasonable people, and they say that it was relevant -- important to them in the total mix of information involved.",
  "The suit cannot -- that is, the suit cannot proceed as a class action. Connecticut Retirement or any --",
  "I -- I think that's wrong. I think that's conceptually wrong, Justice Kagan, in the sense that all that the class certification decision says is that the putative class representative can sue on his own behalf, but he can't drag everybody else into the --",
  "Well, I want to -- I'd like to come back to the question of why whether, even if your -- the premise of your question is correct, it doesn't matter for this case. But let me take one more run at -- at your premise. The next thing that would happen if I'm right, presumably, and the case isn't over, the class just isn't certified, is the defendant -- you know, emboldened by the judge's rule, will file a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that materiality -- the element of the substantive offense, not materiality, the predicate to class certification -- has just been determined in favor of me. That is a very different question for the Court. Materiality, as this Court has said, is fact-sensitive, and it involves a balancing of credibility of witnesses or of expert opinions, and the judge at the -- at the class cert stage, has to find facts and has to make a ruling. When it comes up on summary judgment, what the -- if there is a dispute of material facts, what the judge should do under the law is to say, look, I just held that I didn't think it was material, but I resolved disputed material facts, and that's for the jury, and this case will go to the jury.",
  "Well, in some cases if -- if the alleged fact is -- you know, that Amgen's president got a haircut at 10:30, the judge presumably can say there are -- you know, this is immaterial as a matter of law. But the vast majority of cases -- this is a perfect example -- where they have statements that, in the abstract, extracted from the total mix of information, look pretty material. These are flagship drugs. On the other hand, the evidence we wanted to introduce and the judge wouldn't hear because, in the Ninth Circuit, the test is not proving facts, but simply alleging them --",
  "The judge at the class certification stage is required to weigh competing evidence and -- and render his or her best judgment. At the summary judgment stage, a judge is precluded from doing that.",
  "No, not at all.",
  "No, no, no. The -- the class certification stage requires the moving party -- the putative -- the -- the class representative who is proposing to arrogate to himself and his method of proof the fortunes of all the absent class members, whether they are direct reliers or indirect reliers, tie their fortunes to his fortune at trial. And the judge simply has to say, is this a case in which reliance is a common issue? That is the key through the certification gate in 10b-5 cases.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, let's take an easier case. Let's say I'm somebody who bought Amgen during the relevant period, and they -- the judge says -- you know, I've heard your -- I've considered your event studies, and I think that this is -- information isn't material. There is nothing whatsoever that precludes me from bringing a suit and saying, here's my evidence of material -- I directly relied; here's my evidence of materiality.",
  "The -- the standard of --",
  "Yes.",
  "You are -- you are either right or wrong, depending on how I understood you. Let me --",
  "Let me start with you're right, Justice Kennedy, you're absolutely right.",
  "Okay. Materiality -- the quirk of this case is that materiality is both -- as all my friends on the other side agree, an essential predicate of the fraud-on-the-market theory, that is the essential predicate of the ability to prove indirect reliance on the statement through an assertion that the market price -- that the statement distorted the market price. Everyone agrees that, if the statement isn't material, it didn't distort the market price, and therefore, reliance is an individualized issue for those who actually heard and detrimentally relied on the statement. One of the elements that has to be proven in a 10b-5 case is reliance, which is what we were talking about on the class cert stage, and there, materiality is a predicate for reliance. But even if reliance is proven, materiality is also an element of a 10b-5(b) cause of action, and the standard for materiality is the same. The real question in this case is what is the purpose of Rule 23? If you think that the purpose of Rule 23 is to postpone to the merits everything that can be postponed without a risk of foreclosing valid individual claims, we lose. But that's not the purpose. The purpose is for a court to determine whether all of the preconditions for forcing everyone into a class action are present before you certify.",
  "But I wouldn't.",
  "No.",
  "Justice Breyer, the point of class certification is not to pre-try the merits of the case. What --",
  "The point of the class certification, as this Court explained in Amchem and other cases, and as the Rules Advisory Committee notes, is the question of whether there is class coherence in the first place. It's not the merits issue. It's whether it's fair for the class representative to impose on the defendant the juggernaut of class action and on the absent class members their fortunes in his or her hands. And what --",
  "Justice Kagan, this Court has explained more than once, and I am now quoting from Amchem, that \"class\" -- \"It is class cohesion and only class cohesion that legitimizes representative action in the first place.\" And that question, quote, \"preexists any settlement and therefore a fortiori any litigation.\" Now --",
  "Okay.",
  "The -- there is class -- with respect, there is class cohesion, investors cohere into a class, only when the alleged misinformation was significant enough to affect the price, thus enabling the common claim of relying on the misinformation in the same way. Letting a putative representative through the certification gate, without showing that key, is like, on a theory of no harm, no foul because we’ll all lose together --",
  "-- is like letting -- Justice --",
  "Not challenged in this case.",
  "The answer, Justice Ginsburg, is that the question at the class certification stage -- the predominance question is the reliance element, not the materiality element. Everyone agrees that materiality, like falsity, like scienter, like loss causation, are all common questions. As this Court explained in Basic and reiterated last term in Halliburton, in 10b-5 actions, the question at class certification is whether reliance needs to be proven directly; that is, individually by people who heard and acted in response; or whether the shortcut that this Court authorized in Basic of allowing indirect proof by proving that the statement caused a distortion of the market, is the way to go. There are two tracks, and it happens in this case that materiality is both an element, which is common, and a predicate to class-wide reliance. Everyone agrees that there -- you can't rely as a class on the -- the challenged misstatement, unless the statement moved or had the capability of moving the market price. And that's why the materiality is the glue that holds --",
  "Not at all.",
  "It's the red light.",
  "The tyranny.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's absolutely right. And the same is true for public statement. The way that the government in responding --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "That's not correct, and in any event, that analysis -- that approach is, as I was trying to say, is like letting the fruits justify the search. The question is -- at the time that class certification is sought, the question is do common issues predominate? And the question, in a securities case, is, is reliance in fact -- to quote this Court's opinion, \"in fact, a common issue?\" You also have to prove -- to show that, in fact, it's a common issue, you have to show that the market reacted to the statement, whether it was true or false, whether it was made with scienter or not, whether there was loss causation or not, the market had to react, and to do that, you need all three legs of a stool. The statement has to be material because immaterial statements don't move markets. If that --",
  "It makes perfect sense to me as well, Justice Ginsburg, and I'm not being sarcastic. Materiality is a common question. Just as are many of the other elements of a 10b-5 action --",
  "Well, the question, Justice - - I mean, for -- if it worked for class certification, that would be fine. The question is what the purported class representative has to show to get through the certification gate to transform an ordinary bilateral dispute about, you made a false statement, I relied on it, it caused me to lose money, into something entirely different, a class of tens or hundreds of thousands of people, all of whom are proceeding together, all of their fortunes are married, and the defendant is faced with the full class, what you have to show. And you have to show that reliance is a common issue, regardless of what you have to show down the road.",
  "They differ temporally, they differ functionally, and they differ in terms of who decides it and with what level of finality. They differ temporally because the first question is, is this case going to -- which of two tracks is this case going to proceed? Is it going to proceed as a -- as a direct reliance case -- I heard the statement, and I relied on it -- or is it going to proceed on a theory on behalf of everybody that whether -- the people who relied on it, the people who heard it or who didn't hear it, on a theory that the -- we rely on the integrity of the market, and the integrity of the market was impaired if the statement was false. In any event, there was a price effect. And there isn't a price effect if the statement wasn't material and made publicly into an efficient market.",
  "Material means, at both, as this Court said, that there is a substantial likelihood that the information would have been viewed by a reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information available. That is the test.",
  "That's correct. Just like the market efficiency and the public statement and the market timing. Every one of those predicates has to be proven to the jury's satisfaction at trial. All of them are exactly the same in that respect. May I reserve the balance of my time?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The advisory committee notes to the very amendment that Ms. Sherry was referring to states, quote, \"A fraud case may be unsuited for treatment as a class action if there was a material variation in the kinds or degrees of reliance by the persons to whom they were addressed.\" That is this case. The anomaly of our -- my friend's position is they concede that materiality is a predicate for class reliance. They agree that, unless the statement is material, however efficient the market, however loudly the statement was published, there is no detrimental reliance on the integrity of the market price. Reliance can only be approved -- and, Justice Breyer, this goes to your traditional paradigm case -- in the paradigm case, reliance was proven by the fact that you heard the statement and you did something in reliance on it, to your detriment. The innovation of Basic, and the notion that Basic didn't say anything about class certification under Rule 23 is astonishing, given the fact that the whole reason that the question of the fraud-on-the-market theory was presented, was the inquiry about whether there could be -- whether the traditional bilateral method of proving detrimental reliance on a statement could be aggregated into a ginormous class by allowing everyone to say, well, we relied on the integrity of the market price and a material misstatement -- a material statement affected that price. They said, \"could have\" - -",
  "Right. Those --",
  "Exactly right. And what the Court in Basic could have said, Justice Breyer, was, forget the fraud-on-the-market theory; we are going to absolve -- we are going to say that, for 10b-5 actions, you don't have to prove reliance directly on the statement. We are going to allow you to -- we -- we posit that investors rely in common on the integrity of the market price; and if you can demonstrate to us that a challenged statement moved the market -- if there was market effect, we will allow you to proceed as a class; because then the common answer to the common question, how are you going to prove reliance, is we are going to prove it all the same way because investors rely on the integrity of the market price. Now, the Court in Basic - -",
  "You have to prove that there -- the Court explained correctly in Basic, and this -- this actually goes to -- anticipates my next point, Justice Ginsburg, the Court in Basic didn't say, well, we're going to allow you to --",
  "-- we're going to allow you to --",
  "Correct.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. And in fact, it's a shortcut to a shortcut. What the Court in Basic could have said is, if you want to proceed as a class, you prove to the Court that reliance is common by showing that the market misstatement affected the market price. But the Court in Basic went further in the direction of class plaintiffs and said, you don't have to prove that directly. All you have to prove -- we will allow that to be presumed, if you can demonstrate, without effective rebuttal, four things: the statement was of a type that the market would care about; the statement was made publicly in an efficient market; and the trading occurred during the period between the misstatement and the correction --",
  "Of course not.",
  "The answer is that this is the -- that the point of Rule 23 is to say, you get to use this very useful and powerful device if you have the key to the gate. And the key to the gate is showing that the answer to the question, will reliance be proven commonly -- not lost commonly, but proven commonly -- is, in fact, yes. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the specific area of local hospital services, the Georgia legislature has adopted a model of local public choice, including the choice to reduce or eliminate competition. There is no issue here, Justice Scalia, with respect to your earlier question, of general corporate powers. The Hospital Authorities Law creates local public authorities to, quote, \"exercise public and essential government functions to provide hospital care for residents, especially residents who cannot pay. It empowers authorities to acquire projects\" -- plural -- \"specifically including each authority the ability to acquire hospitals\" -- plural -- but with limitations. They have to -- it has to be within a very confined geographic and demographic jurisdiction. And for authority hospitals, it replaces any pure market model with statutory mandates, a mandate to provide services to all indigent in the community and to price all services on a not-for-profit basis and with a statutory limitation on rate of return. There are --",
  "The -- I guess my point here is that the -- that the legislature's -- the powers that the -- the legislature has given hospital authorities are not, by any means, general corporate powers. They are broader than what a corporation may have in certain respects and much narrower in other respects. And they --",
  "That's right. And there is --",
  "There -- there -- these -- these are -- the supervening wish, mandate, of the legislature -- and this is well-explained in Georgia Supreme Court cases, particularly DeJarnette, which was decided right after Georgia amended its constitution, enacted the Hospital Authorities Law -- was the desire to -- the goal to provide adequate hospital services, particularly for the indigent --",
  "It did. And Georgia's complaint and its theory in the district court, which it did not pursue in the court of appeals or here, not -- was not that the authorities weren't exercising State power, but that the contention that the operation of the hospital by the -- the special purpose corporations that the hospital authority created was not adequately supervised. That is what the State was arguing in the district court. And when it lost that point, it withdrew from the case and has remained absent ever since.",
  "I -- I have no problem with the amicus brief filed by the States supporting the FTC in this case, which is positive, quite expressly and at the outset, on an understanding that what is involved here is simply a State authorization of creation of a local entity with general corporate powers and nothing more. That could not be farther from this case. These special purpose authorities do not simply have general corporate powers. They have a mandate. There is a Georgia constitutional amendment that coincided with the enactment of the Hospital Authorities Law that derogated the State's duty to provide indigent care to its -- hospital care to its citizens.",
  "No. We take seriously the standard that this Court announced in self-consciously clarifying the level of explicitness that a legislature has to use in Town of Hallie. This Court said -- the Court asked whether, quote, \"suppression of competition was a foreseeable result of what the State legislature authorized,\" and it derived that formulation expressly from its earlier decision in City of Lafayette, which explained that a, quote, \"adequate State mandate exists when it can reasonably be inferred,\" quote, \"from the authority given a local entity to operate in a given area that the legislature contemplated the kind of action complained of.\" In other words, as I understand this Court's test, whether what was done by the hospital authority or any sub-State entity was foreseeable by a reasonable legislator, which in this case is that -- was it foreseeable that in -- in pursuing the State-imposed mandate to serve the indigent in a -- in a confined jurisdiction, especially in rural counties which abound in Georgia, a hospital authority might require market power or even a public service monopoly because that --",
  "-- is the natural way to acquit the statutory mandate.",
  "No. I don't -- I don't --",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "So, Justice Sotomayor, as to your first point, our position is not that the only mandate is to serve the indigent. The actual mandate in the constitution and the Hospital Authorities Law is to provide hospital services for all residents, with a particular note to the obligation to serve indigent clients. Second of all, we are not here to -- I mean, I don't know where the government is coming up with its speculation that, out of Georgia's -- I think it's 154 counties, for a population of 10 million people, it is the rare instance in which there will be anything other than just one or -- you know, a multiplicity of hospitals. I mean, the Federal Trade Commission guidelines for market concentration is anything up to four, four or fewer participants. The notion that the legislature, in 1941, was providing the express authority to acquire multiple hospitals in a single municipality or county was focused only on huge metropolises, of which there was only one, or on counties that were so small that they couldn't otherwise even attempt to support more than one hospital is just fanciful; it's made up. And --",
  "Okay. I mean, for one -- one other thing is in Section 7 -- 7-77, as -- as was noted before, the authorities are subject to regulation of rate of return. Now, if that doesn't bespeak the foreseeable consequence of market power, I don't know what -- what does. That is the hallmark of a regulated public service monopoly or at least the regulation of a return by a participant with market power. The other thing that exists -- and the government pooh-poohs this as somehow not part of the Hospital Authorities Law -- is that the Georgia State legislature has -- this is -- this law was enacted in the backdrop of other laws in which Georgia has quite deliberately displaced, quote, \"unfettered private market competition.\" The certificate of need law is the paradigmatic example of the imposition of regulation at the expense of free market competition and, in fact -­",
  "No, no, no. Our argument is not that the certificate -- that the existence of a certificate of need law indicates an intent by the legislature to fully displace the antitrust laws with respect to anybody else. My point is, in the context of other Georgia systems that strictly limit entry into -- or expansion into these local markets, combined with very severe rate restrictions and obligations and mandates to serve -- excuse me.",
  "They can -- I mean, the legislature permits them to be built, bought --",
  "You mean all of the hospitals authorities in Georgia?",
  "The -- the answer, Justice Breyer, I think -- I mean, there is nothing in the record to indicate where all the hospitals --",
  "Well, let's take -- let's take the example --",
  "No, no, no. Let's take the example of this county, in terms of what was done and what is now being challenged. So when the hospital -- there was a public hospital, beginning in 1911, in Dougherty County.",
  "When the State constitution was amended to impose on counties the State's obligation to provide adequate hospitalization care, it enacted the Hospital Authority Law for counties that chose to make use of that device, in order to acquit their public service mandate. And Dougherty County did, soon thereafter --",
  "-- establish a -- an authority, and the assets -- all of the assets and all of the operations of the existing hospital, were transferred. There then -- and there was a natural monopoly in that county.",
  "Then --",
  "Yes. Then --",
  "Right.",
  "Well, I think that --",
  "Yes.",
  "We're not arguing that the Hospital Authority Law gives the hospital authorities the right to regulate non-authority hospitals. We're not arguing that. We're not arguing --",
  "I mean, this doesn't say, you can bring them in where it's anticompetitive to do so. That's their any and all hypothetical. And this Court has never required, for good reason, express authority. That was the whole point of City of Hallie and City of Lafayette -- Town of Hallie and City of Lafayette. The point here is, okay, so they created a hospital authority, it ran a public hospital, it was a natural monopoly. The county grew. A private hospital developed. The public hospital, which is serving more than ten times the number of indigent patients than the private hospital, which is very underused, the county hospital has been -- the hospital authority has been saying, for years and years and years, we need more capacity, we need more capacity. There are -- in order to accomplish our mission, there are two ways to do it. We can only operate in this confine. We can build a new hospital, and here's what it would cost, and here's what we would get. And we would, by the way, have to satisfy the State authorities that we are entitled to a certificate of need in the context in which the private hospital is severely underutilized. Or we can talk with the private hospital about whether they would like to be acquired. And the record shows that they did that for many, many years, even before the Phoebe Putney entities were created.",
  "You mean if it --",
  "I am embarrassed to say I don't know enough about Sherman Act laws --",
  "Probably me sooner than you.",
  "Because the point of State action immunity, which is respect for the sovereign choices of sovereign States, is -- exists not only to provide a -- an ultimate defense in litigation on the merits, it's to protect States and sub-State entities from the cost of litigating. I mean, the question, ultimately, in this case -- and in all these cases -- is who gets to decide? Who gets to decide if this is reasonable or not?",
  "Is it the Federal Trade Commission that comes in and files a lawsuit for this poor hospital authority?",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "I may not be able to convince you, but let me take another run. I think it's the combination because, as this Court has expressed repeatedly, it's -- one has to look at the specific power granted, which here is the power to acquire hospitals within a very circumscribed jurisdiction, in the context of the law as a whole. The context of the law as a whole here -- and I hope this works for the Court, but if it doesn't -- you know, perhaps I am wrong; it certainly makes this a stronger case than Hallie -- here, we have a law that says counties have the obligation now, unlike the State, to provide adequate hospitalization services. They will exercise -- what they do is deemed to exercise public and essential government function within strictly limited areas. And they have the power to acquire hospitals in those areas, subject to very strict rate of return regulations and very, very strict conditions on how they operate those hospitals, including the power to lease to an operator for -- in order to serve the public mission. And they do that against the backdrop of a series of -- they have eminent domain power. They can take another hospital, if it is essential to fulfill their mission.",
  "And they do this in a backdrop of a State that has -- notwithstanding the advocacy of the Federal Trade Commission, has repeatedly strengthened, rather than abrogated, a -- a certificate of need law that leads --",
  "I don't -- I mean, I -- I assume that the Georgia State courts could do that; but, Justice Ginsburg, I think it's important to recognize that the FTC doesn't dispute that the -- that hospital authority -- county hospital authorities are, in fact, agents or arms of the State --",
  "And I believe the FTC -- Mr. Horwich can correct me if I'm wrong -- but I believe the FTC's position is, generally, yes, but not with respect to the -- what is alleged to be a merger to monopoly. And the question in this case is whether or not the acts, under this law and applying the foreseeable result standard, whether the acts of the hospital authority in this case in approving and acquiring the second hospital are fairly attributable to the State. And if I could just --",
  "I was taking a cue from Your Honor the last argument.",
  "Well, I -- for purposes of Federal antitrust law, yes.",
  "But for purposes of State law, almost certainly no. And the point here is -- and that is the point here. The point is that Georgia, either through both private suits and actions authorized by its attorney general, can take steps in order to restrain hospital authorities from doing what they -- and, in fact --",
  "Oh, yes, we do.",
  "We -- we absolutely do, Justice Scalia. There is a solid line of cases in which the Georgia Supreme Court has -- has quite rigorously enforced the limitations of the Hospital Authority Law, in order to prevent hospital authorities from doing things that it says the legislature didn't intend. The Tift County case is the best example, but there are others cited in our brief. The last point --",
  "Yes.",
  "No, no, no. My --",
  "My point is that, with respect to your hypothetical, whether the hospital authority of Fulton County -- and I believe there is more than one hospital authority in Fulton County, and they are authorized to merge, in any event -- but could they acquire, by purchase or eminent domain, all of the hospitals in metropolitan Atlanta to do so? And my point is that for purposes of Federal antitrust law the answer is you are out -- that's -- you are not the authority to inquire. The question is -- just as this Court -- you explained for the Court in Omni, there may be very many things that a local authority can do that would violate State law, and there are State law remedies. And my point only was that the Georgia Supreme Court has been very quick to enforce the limitations. But as a matter of Federal antitrust law, the only question is were they -- were they authorized to do things like this? And if I --",
  "Okay. If I can just finish my answer to Justice -- I have one other point to make for -- to Justice Kagan, who has asked it twice. The -- my last point I want to make -- and then I will answer this -- is that this county -- this hospital authority, like many, facing a capacity constraint and a -- and a nondiscretionary mandate to serve the public needs for hospitalization, had two choices. It could have tried to convince the State to spend three times as much money to get half the number of beds, notwithstanding the existence of excess capacity; or it could buy the other hospital and get that capacity in a consensual transaction by the authority. And here's my point, Justice Scalia, this case is on all fours with this Court's decision in Omni. The notion that this may have long been desired by this -- this special-purpose entity is totally irrelevant. This -- this acquisition was proposed to, considered by, and -- and approved by the hospital authority. And not only that, when the FTC came and complained about it, they reconvened another public meeting and discussed it again and came to the conclusion again that they wanted to acquire this hospital. And before they signed the lease, they issued a notice and comment period. There was three months for people to tell the authority whether this lease was or was not consistent with community interests. They had a public meeting, and they approved it. And that is the act of the State.",
  "I mean, this is -- the Hospital Authorities Law says, counties, this is your responsibility, here are your powers. If anybody in the State or any competitor or the attorney general thinks that you are abusing those statutory powers, the courts are open and quite receptive to those concerns. But there's no --",
  "I don't believe there is any such mechanism, and I believe that the -- the State -- the legislature didn't contemplate anything like that, because the mandate and the responsibility and the authorization was devolved to the counties. Now, Mr. Chief Justice, what the -- what the hospital authority could do and did do, although it's not in the record of this case, is evaluate the likelihood of getting a certificate of need to build the additional required facilities. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me start by answering a couple of, I guess, science or technology questions that came up before launching into our doctrinal position. First of all, Justice Kennedy, soybeans are soybeans. They are harvested at a particular point in time, whatever use is going to be made for them. It is not a plant like a flower, geranium for example, which has to be left to go to seed, or alfalfa. The bean is the seed. All soybeans have to be processed to be used in any way. If they are going to be planted, they have to be cleaned before they are put in the ground at the right time. If they are being fed to either humans or animals, they have to be processed in a way that eliminates an enzyme that makes them indigestible by animals. Justice Scalia, your question about well, farmers now just can't do second plantings because soybeans are put in huge grain elevators and different varieties are mingled, that is true in the sense that if one or more of those soybeans were protected by a patent, the actual growing of the use of those patented inventions without a license would be infringement, although, of course, if no glyphosate were put on top of it, neither the farmer nor Monsanto would ever know that there was an act of infringement. But more to the point, farmers -- I mean, the planting of second crops, that is crop rotation of interspersing soybeans and winter wheat, is very, very common. There are hundreds of thousands of soybean farmers who do this every year. Mr. Bowman has acknowledged that so far as he knows, he's the only one who's doing it this way. But there are plenty of other ways in which he could obtain a much less expensive crop of -- you know, a particular variety of soybean, so one that will all grow to the same height and germinate at the same time. And in fact, he explained this to the district court in his response to the motion for summary judgment at page 152a of the joint appendix. He said defendant wanted a cheap source of seed for his second crop beans because of the normal risks in growing \"wheat beans;\" that is, the second crop that follows the harvesting of winter wheat. Quote, \"defendant simply wasn't going to plant the high priced soybean seed after his wheat crop.\" And here's the relevant sentence. \"Defendant could have purchased conventional seed, that is, non-patented seed, and then saved its offspring for wheat beans.\" In other words, he could have gone and bought a non-patented -- a bag of non-patented seed for much less money, and used it as his second crop, or harvested a portion of it -- and soybeans replicate at a rate between 20 and 80 times in each generation -- and have a perpetual source for his second crop thereafter.",
  "Exactly.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, the -- the glyphosate resistance doesn't change the yield of a particular plant, it changes the way you have to control weeds. And he would not be able to use Monsanto's technology that would allow aerial application of an herbicide. He would have to -- if he wanted to buy plain old, you know, conventional soybeans, he has to control for weeds in the conventional way. And here's the very next sentence in his response to the Court. \"Defendant\" -- that is, instead of purchasing conventional seeds and saving them, he says \"Defendant decided to purchase a grain dealer's commodity grain because he felt there was a good chance he would obtain mostly grain that would be resistant to glyphosate,\" and therefore, he could use Monsanto's technology without having to pay for it. Mr. Chief Justice, your question about this is a new case and -- let me go first to your first question in the case, which is why would a company ever want to do this? I think the answer is that without the ability -- let's talk about soybeans and then broaden it to other kinds of readily replicable technologies -- without the ability to limit reproduction of soybeans containing this patented trait, Monsanto could not have commercialized its invention, and never would have produced what is, by now, the most popular agricultural technology in America because, as Ms. Sherry was pointing out, the sale of the very first Roundup Ready soybean seed, from which all the trillions of Roundup Ready soybean seeds in existence now derive, would have, under Mr. Bowman's theory, fully exhausted not only Monsanto's rights in that seed that was sold, but in all progeny unto the -- however many generations Justice Breyer thinks is \"not too many.\" I think it's important to understand how this technology works. The Department of Agriculture licensed Monsanto to engage in a transformation event; that is, to introduce its recombinant gene into soybean germ plasm. It's illegal to do it unless you get a government license to do it. And you can do it once. And that is done by the technology company, use -- taking something that's called a gene gun and using the gene gun to inject recombinant DNA into regular germ plasm.",
  "The -- the Department of Agriculture authorized Monsanto to engage in -- to transform natural -- natural plant material with its recombinant gene in one single event that is referred to as a transformation.",
  "I think you may be able to shoot several -- I don't know whether you can shoot a whole round or whatever. But in any event, it's one event.",
  "I, in my mind, have been trying to figure out what a gene gun looks like. And I don't know -- I don't know if you could use it to rob a bank. But the point is -- and the -- the Federal Register site for the transformation event with respect to Roundup Ready is -- is provided in a footnote in our brief. What happens then is that Monsanto uses those transformed cells to grow a soybean plant. And that soybean plant produces genetic -- produces seeds or soybeans that have the recombinant Roundup Ready technology in it. Monsanto then provides -- in almost all of the cases, Monsanto engages in licensed sales of those transformed seeds to hundreds of different seed companies that produce different varieties, and they make both conventional seed with a particular varietal makeup and a Roundup Ready version of that variety. Monsanto provides the soybeans that it has transformed to the seed companies, to the hundreds of seed companies for consideration. Under Mr. Bowman's theory, that was it for all of Monsanto's rights with respect to this technology. The very first time it took an original transformed seed and sold it to a seed company so that it could bulk up and cross-breed and produce different varieties, Monsanto had lost all of its patent rights. In other words, by go at -- having committed hundreds of millions of dollars in 13 years to develop this technology in the very first sale of an article that practices the patent, it would have exhausted its rights in perpetuity. Now, we --",
  "Certainly not. Let me make - - let me make three points, starting with the edamame and moving up to inadvertent infringers. Edamame is an immature form of the soybean seed. You can plant edamame --",
  "If I take my -- you know, my Girl Scout troop and have them do a science experiment, it will rot, but it will not generate. And that --",
  "Well, it also reminds me that my original answer to Justice Kennedy is wrong, which is that edamame is taken from the pods before the -- the thing becomes actually a seed that can be processed in any other way. Your point about the ubiquity of Roundup Ready -- Roundup Ready's use is a fair one. I mean, this is probably the most rapidly adopted technological advance in history. The very first Roundup Ready soybean seed was only made in 1996. And it now is grown by more than 90 percent of the 275,000 soybean farms in the United States. But size -- that is, success -- has never been thought and can't be thought to affect the contour of patent rights. You may very -- with soybeans, the problem of blowing seed is not an issue for soybeans. Soybeans don't -- I mean, it would take Hurricane Sandy to blow a soybean into some other farmer's field. And soybeans, in any event, are -- you know, have perfect flowers; that is, they contain both the pollen and the stamen, so that they -- which is the reason that they breed -- breed true, unlike, for example, corn. The point that there may be many farmers with respect to other crops, like alfalfa, that may have some inadvertent Roundup Ready alfalfa in their fields may be true, although it's -- it is not well documented. There would be inadvertent infringement if the farmer was cultivating a patented crop, but there would be no enforcement of that. The farmer wouldn't know, Monsanto wouldn't know, and in any event, the damages would be zero because you would ask what the reasonable royalty would be, and if the farmer doesn't want Roundup Ready technology and isn't using Roundup Ready technology to save costs and increase productivity, the -- the royalty value would be zero.",
  "Mm-hmm.",
  "Well --",
  "So infringement is -- unlike contributory infringement or induced infringement, the act of infringement, that is a violation of Section",
  "-- is a strict liability tort, but it requires affirmative volitional contact -- conduct. That is, it's not that -- a thing doesn't infringe; a person infringes.",
  "The person --",
  "I mean, take the --",
  "Sure.",
  "Of course. I mean, take the example, and this goes to I think the comment made by the Chief Justice, that even in the software context, we haven't had this case yet. You did have this case in -- in Microsoft v. AT&T that involved, you know, Microsoft's golden disk that has the Windows Operating System on it, which is patented, and was being exported overseas for introduction into, you know, computers that were manufactured overseas. And AT&T's patent, which was a method of compressing speech, was practiced by the Windows software. And this Court held that, although the writing of the Windows Operating System into computers in the United States would have infringed the patent, and when Microsoft did that it did infringe AT&T's patent, the fact that the copies were made onto the hard drives of the computer overseas meant that the act of infringement occurred overseas and there was not an export of -- of an infringing product for the purposes of infringing overseas for purposes of Section 271(f). So I think you have decided in the context of software, which of course replicates even more readily than soybeans do or vaccines or cell lines or plasmids, that the copies that are actually made when a -- a software is written onto the hard drive of a computer is a different thing than the disk that was sent and is infringing, if it occurs within the United States.",
  "So the other one --",
  "Okay. Let me -- let me answer your question this way: First of all, we don't think that there's any need whatsoever for this Court -- we agree with the government that there's no need for the Court to address the question of conditional sales and the extent to which patent law recognizes under some circumstances conditional sales because in this case the Federal Circuit did not address that ground which we advocated and we still advocate, but instead said -- and I'm reading from 14a of the petition appendix. \"Even if Monsanto's patent rights in the commodity seeds are exhausted, such a conclusion would be of no consequence because once a grower like Bowman plants the commodity seeds containing Monsanto's Roundup Ready technology and the next generation of seed develops, the grower has created a newly infringing article.\" In other words, what the Federal Circuit decided, and it is entirely correct and it should be affirmed on that basis, is what you're calling, I think generation 3, let's say that for simplicity's sake, since generation 1 is the original soybean sold by Monsanto to seed companies, let's just say that the bags of soybean seeds that farmers go to purchase from seed dealers is called generation N and they are licensed to produce generation N plus 1. But then, what about N plus 2? So what the Federal Circuit held is N plus 2 has never been sold. It was created, it exists without a sale, and because a sale is the sine qua non of patent exhaustion, which is also referred to as first sale, there is no exhaustion. Alternatively, the Federal Circuit said in any event, even when exhaustion applies, it only privileges the using or selling of the article sold; as Your Honor's questions pointed out originally, it never privileges the making of a new infringing product.",
  "If you're referring to generation N plus 2, the answer is yes, because those are newly infringing products with no exhaustion of Monsanto's rights, and as a consequence farmers have no authority to use, make, sell, or offer to sell without Monsanto's authorization. That is a -- just a straightforward application of Section 271.",
  "Okay.",
  "I'm -- I agree that you don't need to reach the prong and you shouldn't.",
  "Well, I think --",
  "I think that -- I think that an appropriate case will come up where it will be important for you to determine that. And our third argument, which wasn't addressed by the Federal Circuit and isn't necessary to affirm, is that conditional sales are not ipso facto unenforceable; that is, a -- in an instant -- everybody understands that if instead of selling technology, you lease it, and you sign a license that imposes conditions on that lease, you know, unless they are unreasonable, conditions that are reasonably related to exploitation of the invention are enforceable. Mr. Bowman acknowledges that. Everyone acknowledges that. Our single submission here is that where you have a technology that cannot be leased because it will consume itself in whatever use one makes of it, and therefore has to be -- an article embodying the invention has to be sold and where the invention cannot be commercialized if it -- if the inventor has to realize its full costs of development and a reasonable rate of return on the first sale, the fact that there is this necessary sale in order to commercialize the invention cannot ipso facto make all such conditions unenforceable. And that's all -- if you were to reach the conditional sale issue in this case, that is all we think this case stands for. And the reason I think --",
  "Yes, and I think the reason, if we take it out of the soybean area, let's look at vaccines. Because the Roundup Ready gene essentially immunizes soybean plants from the herbicide in the same way that a life-saving vaccine will immunize individuals that receive it from some external -- it wouldn't be a herbicide -- a life threat. Okay. Vaccines are live. They have live cultures; they can regenerate themselves. If a company develops the vaccine for, you know, H1 -- I shouldn't be using -- an important life-saving vaccine --",
  "-- it's unsupportable to say that you cannot sell a quantity of that vaccine without exhausting all of your rights in it. I mean, when -- when Schering-Plough or Bristol-Myers develops a vaccine and sells some of it to CVS so I can go in and get injected, they haven't lost all of their patent rights in that vaccine. CVS can't turn around and become a competitor.",
  "Yes, and keep -- well, keep replicating it in competition. Take another example --",
  "Well, CVS was presumably buying it either from the manufacturer or another lab. But the point here is that to take the software example, if I go to, you know, Staples and buy the Windows operating system on a disk, I don't have the authority to put it in a disk replicator and press a button and make a million copies of it. And --",
  "Yeah. Well, let me -- the example that comes to mind is, of course, poor Dr. Chakrabarty who, you know, invented a new man-made bacteria. Bacteria replicate themselves, unlike soybeans which require human intervention. I mean, the notion --",
  "Excuse me?",
  "I mean, my submission about --",
  "Okay. Here's one. I will use something that doesn't make itself because we think that is covered by the new article. Let's say that I invent a new, miraculous new machine. I get a patent for it. I want people to be able -- I'm going to commercialize it. Or I'm going to license with people to commercialize it, but I want people to be able to study it and research it. And so, like Monsanto with its seeds, I sign -- I provide a copy of the machine to MIT, with a research-only license; that is, you can use this machine to figure out how it works and develop new applications and all that sort of stuff. If that sale is exhausting for all purposes, I can't prevent MIT or a third party that MIT provides the machine for --",
  "-- to go into competition with it.",
  "Yes, but you can't lease articles like software and, you know, soybeans that consume themselves in any use, other than an art experiment.",
  "Well, I mean, when you say you can't sell them. So, as Ms. Sherry was pointing out --",
  "That would be true even if this case came out another way, Justice Kennedy. First of all, because grain elevators are prohibited by State and Federal law from selling seed, period. They sell -- they buy grain and they sell grain. They can't sell seed. Number 2, almost all varieties of soybeans or other crop plants are currently protected by the -- under the patent -- the Plant Variety Protection Act. As this Court and Congress recognized, the requisites for getting a certificate are -- I mean, it's like a registration requirement. And we know from J.E.M., and the relevant provision of the PVPA, that it is unlawful to divert crops that are protected by a PVPA certificate for reproductive uses. So irrespective of all of this, whatever happens, even if there is only 1 percent of patented soybeans in a grain elevator, the grain elevator can't sell it as seed both under the Federal and State seed laws and under the Patent Variety Protection Act. That's why the solution for farmers like Monsanto -- like Mr. Bowman, is to simply buy conventional seed, multiply it, you know, 20, 30, 40, 50, 80 times in a single generation and save 1/80th of it to replant in his second crop, if he doesn't want to buy Roundup Ready technology for his second crop and use the glyphosate aerially. Unless the Court has further questions, we will submit.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Stolt-Nielsen, this Court held first that a party may not be compelled to submit to arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to do so. And second, that because class arbitration changes the nature of arbitration to such a degree that it cannot be presumed that parties consented to class arbitration simply by agreeing to submit their disputes to an arbitrator. That precisely describes this case. The agreement commits the parties to submit their disputes to arbitration and says nothing about class arbitration. There is no extrinsic evidence suggesting that the parties ever considered such a prospect, and there is no background principle of State law that favors it.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, two things. First of all, if you look at page 10 -- or page 14, footnote 7 of our yellow brief, you'll see all of the references made in the advocacy before the State court judge by my -- my brother here, not recognizing repeatedly that what Oxford was asking for was a dismissal and a transfer to individual arbitration -- bilateral arbitration. There was no mistake, whatsoever, in the New Jersey State courts that Oxford's position was that --",
  "Yes -- that bilateral arbitration was what was requested, and -- but there was similarly no dispute that both parties -- certainly Oxford took the position based on an understanding of New Jersey law at the time because this Court hadn't decided class action question, that the decision would be submitted in the first instance to the arbitrator as it was in Stolt-Nielsen. Yes, Justice Sotomayor. I apologize.",
  "In the first instance, no.",
  "Well, I think there was a mistake here. I think it was -- it was understandable, in light of the state of the law in 2002. But we --",
  "I'm --",
  "Oh, Justice Sotomayor, we are not asking the Court to vary in any material respect the highly deferential standard that's reflected in Section 10(a)(4) of the Federal Arbitration Act. But we are asking that that generally applicable standard of review be applied to a question with a very strong empirical presumption that the FAA has attached to it and this Court has announced, which is, that absent an actual agreement by the contracting parties that they will permit their disputes to be arbitrated on a class basis, an inference that may not, as a matter of Federal law, be derived from an agreement to submit all disputes to arbitration --",
  "Well, in this case, you defer, as you always do, but you -- you have to provide -- there is some level of review. It's not just because the arbitrator says I've looked at the contract and I think this. As this Court has said over and over again, including in Stolt, just saying something is so doesn't make it so. There is deferential review, but there is review. And the review is of a proposition that this Court has now said twice strongly presumes that there is -- there is no agreement to arbitrate as a class unless it is clearly shown to be so and that that showing is not satisfied by an all-disputes clause.",
  "Well, I think --",
  "So I -- I think -- I mean, this Court has recognized repeatedly that class -- that the question of class versus bilateral arbitration is a special kind of question under the FAA as to which the Federal Arbitration Act itself applies a rule of decision. And therefore, the question I suppose is, when a court looks at a -- an assertion by an arbitrator that the language of the contract permits -- and in this case, the arbitrator found that it required class arbitration, a court has to ascertain whether that assertion of fact is at least plausible, or, to use the vernacular of this Court in Stolt-Nielsen, the Court said in Stolt-Nielsen that the stipulation left no room for an argument that the parties had agreed. And similarly here, the --",
  "Correct.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, the -- everyone agrees in this case, as one would have to, based on the holding in Stolt-Nielsen, that if the -- this arbitration clause in this case just said all disputes will be arbitrated, not litigated, that the arbitrator could not -- the arbitrator would be reversed if it -- if he found that that indicated an actual agreement of the parties to class arbitration. That is inconsistent with the actual holding in Stolt-Nielsen. And in this case, that sentence is indistinguishable from that orthodox clause. All that we --",
  "Well, not to be pejorative, but I would say this, in the vernacular of Stolt-Nielsen, this language, quote, \"leaves no room\" for a conclusion that the parties agree to arbitrate on the facts --",
  "Yes. And in this case, a question of Federal arbitration.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, let me -- let me -- let me refer you to Stolt-Nielsen first, and then to a hypothetical example that my brother gives.",
  "Okay. Stolt-Nielsen said --",
  "Oh, you mean a non-class action case.",
  "Justice Scalia, I can't -- I'm sort of trying to scroll through all your arbitration decisions. I can't -- there may be. I can't think of a holding of this -- well, no, I guess -- I guess First Options is an example in which the arbitrator found that the parties had agreed to let the arbitrator decide the arbitrability question. And this Court held that that was wrong as a matter of fact. The Court reviewed the -- the facts of the case and said there is no way that the Kaplans agreed to have the arbitrability question submitted. And if I may -- I realize this isn't an actual case -- but my brother gives the example of a form of deferential review, which would allow a court to examine and reverse an arbitrator's decision in a context in which the arbitration agreement says, this is going to be arbitrated under California law, and the arbitrator says, well, I'm going to apply New York law in this case because -- I don't know, the parties have all moved to New York and they like New York and they litigate in New York. My brother says that is reviewable and reversible. And that's exactly what we have here. We have here a clause that this Court has said cannot suffice to establish actual agreement to arbitrate as a class. And the arbitrator has said nonetheless, I have read it that way.",
  "The fact -- the fact that the arbitration clause -- the sentence has two clauses. One says, you cannot bring a civil action in court about any dispute under this agreement, you must settle your disputes in arbitration, is completely orthodox. And as we point out at page 24, note 3 of our blue brief, it's quite arguably required by New Jersey law and laws of other States that say to be perfectly -- it is -- you have to be perfectly clear when you are telling a contract -- a contracting counterparty that disputes will be arbitrated. You have to tell them that that means that they cannot bring their disputes in court. And a rule -- a reading of this -- I mean, I -- I submit to you that, consistent with grammar and ordinary meaning of words, it cannot be plausibly read to say that you can't bring a civil action about any dispute in court means that you can -- you are agreeing to arbitrate your dispute on a class basis, for a whole variety of reasons.",
  "Yes.",
  "I agree with that as a proposition of what review is under 10(a)(4), that is whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority. In this case, in the context of the question about actual agreement to arbitrate on a class -- as a class, this Court has interpreted Federal law to require evidence of a contractual basis of actual agreement between the parties and has precluded, as a matter of Federal law, an arbitrator from inferring such agreement from an all-disputes clause.",
  "I think that -- I mean, trying I think is not a defense. What I would say, in addition --",
  "Right, but he did not take cognizance of the holding of this Court in Stolt-Nielsen, reiterated in Concepcion, that you may not infer intent from an agreement to submit to arbitration. And more fundamentally, he did not heed the presumption in the Federal -- under the Federal Arbitration Act that this Court's holdings in those two cases reflects. That is, there -- this Court said in Concepcion that it would be hard to imagine that -- hard to believe that defendants would ever bet the company with no effective means of review. There is therefore a presumption in the law that, absent a very clear statement of a meeting of the parties' minds there is no consent. But he indulged the opposite presumption. His presumption was --",
  "Justice Kagan --",
  "We are not -- you didn't say the words \"clear statement.\" You -- what you said in Stolt-Nielsen -- what you held in Stolt-Nielsen was not simply that parties who have stipulated can't be forced into class arbitration. What you held was that you cannot have class arbitration in the absence of affirmative agreement that is not evidenced by an all-disputes clause. And the -- that background -- that strong presumption must, as a matter of Federal law, inform the arbitrator's decision. And in this case, not only didn't it because you said, look, an all-disputes clause doesn't suffice. And he said, well, there's the word \"civil action\" in here and I think that that not only suffices, but that indicates an actual agreement to require class arbitration. That doesn't pass any test. It doesn't --",
  "Arbitration clauses that say, in one form of words or another, that you may not bring any dispute to court, you must bring all disputes to arbitration, is -- is utterly commonplace. There was I a -- there was a clause in the Steelworkers' trilogy. mean, they -- there's a lot of citation to Enterprise Wheel in this case. The -- the provision in -- in the Steelworkers agreement, and virtually all labor agreements, make this explicit. It's not precisely every single article and preposition in the clause here, but it is functionally indistinct. The same was true --",
  "I -- so far as the record shows, yes. But my -- whether he was right or wrong about this, I submit to you two things: Number one, there is no way -- three things: Number one, there is no way consistent with the rules of grammar that one can read this sentence as sending class actions to arbitration -- requiring class arbitration. Number two, there is no heed by the arbitrator -- Number two is that -- that for all intents and purposes this clause is the clause that is orthodox, that was at issue in Stolt-Nielsen. It's the same as the one the Fifth Circuit decided and the Second Circuit decided in the cases -- the other cases that created the split here. It's the same as the standard labor clause that was at issue in the Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel. And -- and this is my other point -- it is plain from the arbitrator's decisions, both in his 2003 decision and in his post-Stolt-Nielsen 2010 decision, that he not only was not applying the Federal law presumption that this Court identified in Stolt and Concepcion, but he was applying the opposite presumption. He said in 2003 that because -- if this -- if this clause wouldn't be construed to permit or require class arbitration, it would mean that the parties had agreed not to resolve their disputes in any forum using a class manner, and that would be, quote, \"so bizarre, it would require an express provision.\" In 2010, he said, well, I overshot the mark here. But the point is still the same. And this is on page 41a -- 40a and 41a of the petition appendix. He said, the -- the point is that if he is not allowed to bring a class proceeding in arbitration when he at least presumptively was in State court, that would be so strange that, \"If the clause,\" and I'm quoting from the second full paragraph on 41a, \"If the clause cannot permit Dr. Sutter's court class action to go to arbitration, then Dr. Sutter's original class action must be outside of the arbitration agreement altogether.\" In other words, he was indulging a presumption that it is so unnatural --",
  "So the arbitrator -- so a couple of responses. The arbitrators in Stolt-Nielsen didn't apply -- didn't construe AnimalFeeds' lawyers' concession at oral argument before the arbitrators the same way this Court did. What it said was that it is looking at the language of the contract and as this Court's majority opinion points out, there are several textual references in the arbitrators' decision, and they decided, well, we're interpreting this, applying, I think they said, New York principles, that the parties didn't agree to preclude it, therefore, they must be understood to have permitted it. What this Court said is, as a matter of law, no. Silence doesn't mean consent. Consent can only be shown in this type of decision by an actual agreement. The Court italicized the word \"agreement\" twice in its opinion. And it doesn't show actual agreement if you just agree to arbitrate, not litigate, your disputes.",
  "I am not sure, Justice Alito, if the record shows. I believe it's by the hour. The -- the point is that what this Court's -- the fact that there was a stipulation that the Court identified in Stolt-Nielsen made it easier to apply the principle that you -- that -- that actual agreement is required, but you can't infer it from an all-disputes clause to the case. The Court said that the stipulation, quote, \"left no room for an inquiry regarding the parties' consent.\"",
  "Yes, I do, but --",
  "If you -- so if you -- an arbitrator exceeds his powers if it -- if he decides to arbitrate a subject matter that the parties have not agreed to arbitrate. He -- he exceeds -- he or she exceeds his or her power if they -- if he or she decides, as this Court stated in Stolt-Nielsen, that you agreed to arbitrate with someone with whom you didn't agree to arbitrate. That is this case. And as I said, we are not at the -- if you asked -- I don't -- I would apply -- I think you could simply apply the standard that you applied in Stolt-Nielsen, which is the \"leave no room\" standard, which is pretty darn deferential, and you would have to find that this sentence, in light of Federal law as announced by Stolt-Nielsen, leaves no room for a conclusion that the parties, that Oxford and Dr. Sutter, actually agreed to class arbitration regarding their disputes.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, neither the arbitrator nor any of the courts below made any finding about whether this is a contract of adhesion or whether this is a so-called negative value case. There was litigation over Federal court subject matter jurisdiction and the court found that there was, in part based on evidence that Oxford submitted, that there were many claims that were far in excess of $75,000. And it is not true that Dr. Sutter's claims as he brought them to arbitration was $1,000 or anything like it. May I reserve the balance of my time?",
  "Thank you. I have three points, two small ones and one significant one. The first small one is that this notion, this canard, that we told the district -- the State court judge that class actions should be sent to arbitration is dispensed with on pages 13 and 14 of our reply brief, following the sentence, \"Tellingly, Sutter resorts in part to misrepresenting Oxford's previous positions.\" And I refer the Court again specifically to footnote 7 on page 14, where we quote my brother's statements to the State court judge explaining that what we were asking for was, quote, \"a motion to compel individual arbitration.\" The second small point goes to the issue of what the number is of class arbitrations. I also don't know that. But we know that as of this Court's decision in Stolt-Nielsen because this was reported in the AAA amicus brief, that not a single final decision had been rendered prior to -- as of the time of Stolt-Nielsen, in any class arbitration. The AAA class arbitration rules were adopted after this Court's decision in Bazzle, which left open the possibility, a possibility that the arbitrator in this case said was surprising because the arbitrator said quite correctly that everyone expected that in Bazzle this Court would say there's no such thing as class arbitration.",
  "I can't go back 200 years, but let's just go to 1960 in terms of the standard. And in the Steelworkers v. the Enterprise Wheel case, what this Court held was, quote, \"An award is legitimate only so long as it draws its essence from the agreement. When the arbitrator's words manifest an infidelity to this obligation, courts have no choice but to refuse enforcement of the award.\" And our submission is that this award, the conclusion that the all-disputes provision here manifested an actual agreement by the parties to class arbitration, cannot possibly be reconciled with the plain language or Stolt-Nielsen's holding. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Patent law places the burden of proving infringement on the patentee. And until this case, it was settled that the burden does not shift if the issue arises in a declaratory action seeking a judgment of non­infringement. The Federal circuit imposed a different rule in suits brought under MedImmune where the party seeking a declaration of non­infringement is a licensee. That was error. Allocation of the burden of proof inheres in the governing substantive law, while the Declaratory Judgment Act is procedural only and does not change substantive rights. The burden of proof in MedImmune actions, like all other declaratory actions, remains where it would have rested in the equivalent coercive suit brought by that patentee.",
  "That's correct. That's ­­ that's the issue in this case. Although as we point out, that the word \"burden of proof\" ­­ I think the word \"burden of proof\" used in the opinion below could be thought to be addressed to both points, but the parties agree that the relevant consideration here is the burden of proof and that trial judges do retain discretion to make rules about ordering ­­ the ordering of proof in patent cases.",
  "Right. Well, that, of course, was not what happened in ­­ not what the Respondent maintained should happen in this case. But taking your question as it is, this Court has pointed out repeatedly that the burden of ­­ where the burden of persuasion rests is very often outcome ­­ outcome determinative. And that is certainly true in patent cases. What the jury is told about who has the burden of persuasion is surpassingly important in many cases, including many patent cases. And that's the issue in this case. I mean, the substantive ­­ the ­­ the reason why the Federal circuit erred is clearly doctrinal, which is this Court has said, over and over again, that burdens of proof, like standards of proof, are substantive. They inhere in the substantive right, and the Court has also said, repeatedly, that the declaratory judgment action is procedural only and doesn't change substantive rights. But I think if you go to a ­­ to the policy question, Justice Alito, reversing the burden in a declaratory action would impair the purpose and utility of the Declaratory Judgment Act, which was enacted to provide a mechanism for determining how the equivalent coercive action would be resolved without the ­­ without requiring the declaratory judgment plaintiff to subject itself to retrospective liability. And, indeed, shifting the burden would threaten the issue preclusive effect of the declaratory judgment, frustrated ­­",
  "Well, the ­­ the reason, Mr. Chief Justice, is the reason that the burden of proof is substantive, and a declaratory judgment action under the Act is not ­­ is aimed not to change any substantive rights. And that's why all of the decided cases in this area, except for the one below, left the burden exactly where substantive patent law left it.",
  "You're right about that, and that would be true, Justice Kennedy, on all MedImmune cases.",
  "Well, I don't know that it's a formality of a notice. I mean, the issue that this Court addressed in MedImmune ­­ the question that you're raising, I think, is one that goes to Article III jurisdiction. You can't use the declaratory judgment procedure to get the Court to answer a hypothetical question.",
  "I think the notice is the ­­ well, it's essential to the Article III MedImmune question, whether or not there actually is a case or controversy. So, in this case, it's perfectly obvious because the ­­ the license requires Medtronic to affirmatively go to Mirowski within 30 days of introducing any product and not only tell ­­ providing notice of the product, but providing the manual ­­ the diagrams and the manuals that are given to physicians so that Mirowski can determine, within 60 days, whether or not to assert infringement. In MedImmune, you didn't have that procedure, but the Court still held in the context of that case that, because Genentech had made clear that it thought that the Cabilly patent covered the accused devices, there was sufficient ­­ sufficiently concrete controversy that MedImmune did not have to stop paying royalties and breach the license. And ­­ and so, therefore ­­ I think I may be talking around your question, but I am trying to get to the point that the ­­ the requirement of some notice, the ­­ the patentee ­­ there's no declaratory judgment jurisdiction if the patentee doesn't know about the product, has ­­ has never done anything to suggest that the product ­­ that his or her patent reads on the product. But that is an Article III question that would be ­­ you wouldn't get to the burden of proof if you couldn't satisfy MedImmune.",
  "We agree with the articulation of the point by the Solicitor General in the United States brief, which is that the cases have recognized that non­infringement can either be a general defense ­­ that is, when ­­ when non­infringement is simply a general denial of a cause of ­­ of a claim of infringement, it is not an affirmative defense. But there are particular types of non­infringement claims. And the ones that I'm familiar with are prosecution history estoppel and the experimental use exception that are affirmative defenses. In other words, those are situations in which the alleged infringer says, hey, I'm not saying that your patent doesn't read ­­ all the claims of your patent don't read on my invention; I'm claiming non­infringement because I was making experimental use, and that has affirmatively been determined by Congress not to infringe. Or, yes, your ­­ the elements of your claim read upon my invention, but during the prosecution of the patent in the Patent Office, you disclaimed some claim scope, and under prosecution history estoppel, this Court elucidated in Festow, there is no infringement. This is a case involving a general denial of infringement, and therefore, it is not an affirmative defense.",
  "Yes. I mean ­­ absolutely. I mean, the point here ­­",
  "Right. So a defense of non­infringement ­­ a general defense of non­infringement is not an affirmative defense. And in the ­­ the potential or correlative coercive action which would have been a suit for patent infringement by Mirowski, had we ceased making the royalty payments, they would have borne the burden of proving infringement, unless we raised an affirmative defense, like prosecution history estoppel or experimental use, in which case we would have the burden. The point of the Declaratory Judgment Act is that the burden is left exactly where it would have been, had there been no ­­ had this identical issue arisen in the absence of the declaratory judgment procedure. And in this respect, it is identical to the jury trial right, which this Court held in Beacon Theatres v. Westover, is also an element of the substantive claim and also cannot be deprived by the peculiarity of a declaratory judgment being a claim for an equitable remedy.",
  "Mm­hmm.",
  "So if I understand your question, first, to ­­ to go to the license in this case. This case not only involves products that didn't ­­ that aren't specifically articulated in a license agreement; neither the patents nor the products at issue in this case had even been conceived, much less in existence, at the time the license agreement was in effect. But in ­­ if I understand your question, in a situation in which I make Widget A and you claim that you have the patent that reads on that widget, and I ­­ you agree to license me to do it, if the license ­­ if payment of the license depends upon a determination that it otherwise would be infringing, I can file a declaratory judgment action and seek a declaration that it's not infringing. That is, if the cover ­­ if the license covers only products that otherwise would infringe, I can bring a DEC action, claiming non­infringement, and you would bear the burden, assuming that you had threatened, in some way, to enforce your patent against me. In ­­ in the ­­ the situation that ­­ sort of bogeyman situation that Mirowski and the ­­ the intellectual property owner's brief articulate, which ­­ imagine, which is you license ­­ I have a ­­ I have a product, you have a patent, you license it to me, and I turn around the next day and sue for ­­ a declaration of non­infringement, there are any number of ways that you, as the patentee, could protect yourself from that extraordinary eventuality. You could provide, for example, that ­­ I ­­ you would require me to issue a ­­ you know, to ­­ to ­­ to pay a paid­up royalty for all use. Or you could simply say, we don't care whether the patent infringes or not; you agree to pay me three dollars per unit sold. Or you could put a provision in that would say, if you sue for patent infringement, the royalty rate goes to 3X. Or, for that matter, if you sue, that will ­­ that can ­­ I can deem that a breach of the license agreement and ­­ and recover the ­­ the remedies that patent law allows, an injunction and treble damages and attorneys' fees in the context of a ­­ a willful action. I want to underscore, although the Federal circuit made a broad rule, exactly what we have here. In this case, Mirowski ­­ this license is from 1991. Mirowski ­­ it's not in the record, but there's no dispute that Mirowski has received hundreds of millions of dollars of royalties from Medtronic for its patents. It gets, as a benefit of this license ­­ notice, as I said, within 30 days of every new product and the manual, and it can require Medtronic to start accruing royalties and an interest rate of 2 ­­ of 2 points over prime, as soon as it sends us a notice. And moreover, in the ­­ in the litigation tolling agreement, we agree that, even though we are not a party in the referenced St. Jude action, we would be bound by any determination in that adjudication, whereas, otherwise, we wouldn't. So this license agreement was enormously beneficial and couldn't be farther from the scenario of I have a widget, I agree to license it, and the next day, I turn around and sue you. But, in that event, there would be lots and lots of remedies. I do want to underscore one other thing, that the Federal circuit said that it was applying this special rule only in MedImmune­type cases. But the rationale of the court is that what causes the burden to shift is the absence of a counterclaim for infringement. That would have, for example, caused the burden to shift in the Myriad case that this Court decided last term, where there was one researcher at NYU who had standing to bring a declaratory judgment action. There was no basis for Myriad to claim infringement because he had made clear that he wouldn't ­­ he wouldn't engage in the research and clinical work that he was going to, so long as he was in risk of patent infringement remedies. And that ­­ the source of the rule ­­ the source of the law where the burden of proof lies, is in substantive patent law. And this Court has said, for 125 years, that it rests with the infringer. What neither the Federal circuit nor my friend on the other side of this case has ever identified is what is the source of the rule that shifts the burden in a declaratory judgment action? It can't be the Declaratory Judgment Act because that Act is procedural only. If I can reserve the balance of my time?",
  "I'd be happy to respond to any questions that the Court has. Otherwise, I think we’ll submit on the briefs.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Atkins v. Virginia, this Court held that the Constitution bars executing persons with mental retardation; that is, persons with significantly subaverage intellectual function concurrent with deficits in adaptive behavior with an onset before the age of 18. Because of the standard error of measurement that's inherent in IQ tests, it is universally accepted that persons with obtained scores of 71 to 75 can and often do have mental retardation when those three prongs are met. The statistical error of measurement or SEM is that ­­",
  "Let me first take ­­ take some issue, with all due respect, with your characterization of Atkins. What this Court said in Atkins is not that we leave it to the States to establish the standards for the clinical condition of mental retardation. What you said, quoting Ford, is, \"We leave it to the States to ­­ we leave to the States the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction that we announce.\" The rule that we advocate is ­­ and the only real question presented in this case is just this: If a State conditions the opportunity to demonstrate mental retardation on obtained IQ test scores, it cannot ignore the measurement error that is inherent in those scores that is a feature, statistical feature of the test instrument itself.",
  "Justice Scalia, I have ­­ I would like to respond with four points, and I hope desperately I'll remember them. First of all, what this Court said was, this Court ­­ number one, it made clear, as it has reiterated in Miller v. Alabama and Graham v. Florida, that while a consensus or a perceived consensus among the States is important, the ultimate test is this Court's conclusion about what the Eighth Amendment does or doesn't allow. In making that determination at page 318 of this Court's opinion in Atkins, this Court, after reciting in Footnote 3 the virtually identical clinical definitions of mental retardation, and in Footnote 5, pointing out that 70 to 75 is the established cutoff for mental retardation, this Court said the following: Quote, \"Clinical definitions of mental retardation require\" ­­ and it recited the three tests. \"Because of their impairments, mentally retarded persons by definition\" ­­ that is by the clinical definition ­­ \"have diminished capacities to understand\" ­­ and it recited all the other disabilities that made the imposition of the death penalty for persons with that ­­ excuse me ­­ with that clinical condition unconstitutional. Now, as to what the States did, the Court did refer to, I believe, 18 State statutes. Not a single one of those State statutes and not a single decision of the highest court of any State or any court in any State applied 70 or two standard deviations from the mean without reference to the SEM. The only statute that addressed it in 2002, when this Court decided Atkins, was Arizona, which expressly provided that the SEM must be taken into account in evaluating the ­­ an obtained IQ test score.",
  "The standard error of measurement, which is established by the creators of the test. It is not something that clinicians dream up. It's not something that is decided by the AAIDD or the American Psychiatric Association. It is inherent in the test. And all clinicians are told ­­ both professional associations make clear, because it is simply a statistical fact, it must be taken into account such that an obtained IQ test score is actually the result of an obtained IQ test score, is a test band that accounts for the standard.",
  "Well, what they're ­­ they are looking for ­­ I mean, intelligence tests supply a ­­ I mean, they weren't created for the definition of ­­ clinical definition of mental retardation. They were created as a ­­ in order to determine a proxy for true intellectual function. And therefore ­­",

  "There are many reasons why a person's IQ, that is, a person's intelligent ­­ intellectual functioning, may be important for a whole variety of reasons, medical, psychological, developmental, and as a component of the clinical condition of mental retardation, the Eighth Amendment.

  "I mean, the ­­ the concept, the statistical concept of a standard error of measurement has ­­ applies to all forms of testing.",

And because ­­ if ­­ if a State is using an obtained IQ test score as a proxy for true intellectual function, it has to take into account the standard error of measurement. And therefore, States like Mississippi and Oklahoma that, in fact, establish a cutoff of 75, in our view, is constitutional as this Court announced the class of individuals in Atkins because ­­",

  "So I ­­ the short answer is, I believe, what I will come to is yes, so that you see where I'm going. But we believe that it is entirely constitutional for the State to assign the burden of proving mental retardation on the defendant. And insofar as the clinical definition recognized by this Court in Atkins is a three­part conjunctive test, I think it's fair to say that a logical consequence of that is that as to every component the burden may constitutionally be placed on the defendant. Now, the burden with respect to prong one is the burden of proving significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, of which a true IQ score is a probabilistic piece of evidence. I don't think ­­",
  "I think ­­ let me see if I can explain this. First of all, we're talking ­­ I mean, this is a man who has a 71.",
  "Okay.",
  "As ­­ as to the general issue, let me ­­ let me ­­ let me state it this way: The whole idea behind measurement error is that you can't make a valid judgment that somebody doesn't have a true score of 70 or below if the obtained score is within the measurement error. And even more fundamental than that, the ­­ your question suggests and the State's suggestion suggests that diagnosing mental retardation, which is the constitutional inquiry, is just a probabilistic inquiry into a person's, quote, \"true\" IQ score. But true IQ scores themselves are a statistical concept. It's the score that you would get on a hypothetical test that had no measurement error. But true ­­ and this is my point ­­ true IQ is not the same as intellectual function and IQ tests themselves, however perfect they may be, don't perfectly capture a person's intellectual function, which is why ­­",
  "So I ­­ what I'm ­­ this ­­ this would not be a standard I would endorse, but I believe that in light of the consensus test that all professional organizations apply that was recognized in Atkins, a score that is above the standard error of measurement of two standard deviations above the mean would be okay. But the point ­­ the converse point it seems to me is not true, which is we know for a fact that many, many people who obtain test scores of 71 to 75, in fact, have mental retardation. And if I just may point out that in this case, there were six experts who fully examined Mr. Hall or supervised a full examination of Mr. Hall. They were cognizant of the IQ test scores that he had received. And each one of them opined without hesitation that he had mental retardation, functional mental retardation, significant ­­",
  "Excuse me?",
  "That is correct, Justice Ginsburg. Now, the State trial court ruled that it would not accept evidence as to prongs two and three, but it did allow Mr. Hall's lawyers to make a proffer pursuant to the State's ­­ the State's agreement that there could be a proffer in some expeditious manner. And that's at Joint Appendix 158. We ­­ one of the two grounds that we appealed to the Florida Supreme Court on, in addition to the hard cutoff at 70, was the fact that in fact an expeditious proffer did not in fact permit us to put on all of our evidence about prongs two and three. And the Florida Supreme Court, and this is page 125 of the Joint Appendix, said: We don't need to consider that question because we uphold the rule in Cherry.",
  "You're correct. Part of the expeditious proffer ­­ the expeditious proffer was limited to the testimony of two of ­­ I believe actually only one of the experts who examined him and did the adaptive testing function, and that expert did say that he didn't test in prison. Now, as ­­ there is, again, a universal professional consensus that adaptive functioning is tested by adaptive functioning in the real world, not adaptive functioning that occurs on ­­ after 35 years on death row. And, in fact, we also know to a clinical certainty that because mental retardation is a condition that is both developmental and not transient, that is, there has to be an onset ­­ demonstrated onset during the developmental period, but one doesn't emerge from the condition of mental retardation, unlike, for example, mental illness.",
  "That's exactly what it means, Justice Kennedy. What it means is, it is a ­­ as this Court recognized, it is a clinical condition, unlike, for example, insanity or competence. That the clinical ­­",
  "I ­­ I'm actually not aware of anything that suggests that one ­­ that society doesn't look to professional evaluations to do this. And, in fact, if one looks only at Florida's system, Florida uses mental retardation as a determinant for things other than the death penalty. It uses the existence of the condition for educational remediation, vocational rehabilitation and everything. And in those instances, as we point out in our brief, the ­­ the Florida ­­ Florida does apply the standard error of measurement. And indeed ­­",
  "Oh, I think it has to be much, much, more because, as this Court pointed out, this is a clinical condition. It's a condition that can only be appropriately diagnosed by professionals.",
  "Justice Scalia ­­",
  "The latter is not true. The ­­ the standard ­­ two things that are not in dispute in this case. We're only here talking about prong one, which is significantly subaverage intellectual functioning and nothing else. And everyone agrees, all the States agree, they all agreed at the time Atkins was decided, that their ­­ that the clinical definition is defined by three elements and that the first element, significantly subaverage intellectual functioning is defined as a person whose intellectual function is two or more standard deviations below the mean intellectual functioning of contemporary society.",
  "So the fact that two SEMs gives you a 95 percent confidence level is just the statistical fact. I take your question to be, well, why does ­­ you know, why do clinicians and professional associations use that?",
  "Oh, I see.",
  "Because the whole ­­ and this goes to the reason that they use it. The reason that they use it is because of the inherent imprecision in testing in general, but in particular testing for the presence of something like relative intellectual functioning. There are so many ­­ it is so common for people who, for a variety of reasons, obtain a 71 or 72, in fact, to have mental retardation and because evidence of ­­ an evaluation of intellectual function involves clinically much more than a test score. I mean, look what happened in this case. All of the IQ tests that were administered, all of the Wechsler tests, were accompanied, because they fell within the standard error of measurement, they were accompanied by the administration of further intelligence testing for confirmatory purposes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, let me just, as to your latter point ­­",
  "You are not right in some of the things you've said.",
  "The last thing you said is not right, which is ­­",
  "Well, the last thing is important.",
  "You are right that 95 percent is just a feature ­­ is, generally speaking, a feature that is widely adopted as a confidence level, and it is particularly important here because the constitutional guarantee announced in Atkins is against the execution of persons with mental retardation. And ­­",
  "So, this is the last point that I wanted to get to, and I think if you ­­ that the best thing I can ­­ before my time runs out, I just want to point you to page 10, Footnote 3 of our reply brief, which cites the Oxford Handbook of, I don't know, Clinical Diagnosis or something, and we've given you the pages. And on those pages, it explains why when you have a situation of somebody who takes more than one test, the appropriate determinant is very much not the average. It is what's called the composite score. And the composite score is different, and, in fact, for people below the mean, below the average, because you have to take into account the fact that regression towards the mean and also, the fact that a person who takes two, three, or four tests, multiple tests, changes the bell curve of standard deviation. So the example that's given in the Oxford Handbook is very similar to this case. There were four tests. They averaged at 72. The composite score, and there's ­­ there's a ­­ there's a statistical explanation for how it's arrived at. The composite score is 69, and the standard error of measurement is actually larger using a composite score. So that's why, as to Justice Breyer's last point, simply averaging obtained scores does not, in fact, give you a better handle. Because there are so few people who score significantly below the mean on multiple tests, what clinicians use is a statistical analysis that takes into account the different ­­ the different calculation of what a standard deviation below the mean is.",
  "Well, we know what Florida does, which ­­",
  "Well, in our view, the Eighth Amendment requires that if a State chooses to use IQ test scores as a proxy for intellectual functioning rather than a full inquiry into intellectual functioning, it cannot refuse to employ the standard error of measurement that is inherent in the test.",
  "Our ­­ our view is that a State consistent with Atkins could say that if you have no obtained score on a valid, properly administered, up­to­date test that is 70 ­­ that is below 76, you may ­­ you may constitutionally be precluded. I think many clinicians would go ahead and do adaptive functioning and other intellectual functioning. But our view is that States like Mississippi and Oklahoma that set 76 as the cutoff do, in fact, comply with Atkins. May I save the balance of my time.",
  "In State v. Cherry, which is the ­­ the Florida Supreme Court decision that established this rule that if you ­­ if your lowest score or your only score is 71, you are out, and that applies whether you take one test or multiple tests ­­ here I'm quoting from the Supreme Court's decision in Cherry, that, quote, \"It is a universally accepted given, that is that the SEM is a universally accepted given, and as such should logically be considered in determining whether a defendant has mental retardation.\" What the Court said was: We have to read the plain meaning of the Florida statute and the Florida statute says two standard deviations. The notion that the Florida legislature or the ­­ may I finish my sentence ­­ the Florida legislature or the people of Florida have made a considered decision not to account for the SEM is baseless and is belied by the ­­ the legislative report that accompanies the statute which said 70 to 75.

  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Lanham Act provides a remedy for businesses whose market is misappropriated by competitors that misrepresent the character of the goods they sell. This case presents an egregious violation of the law.

The label is not, in fact, authorized for reasons we explain and with which the United States largely agrees, but even if it were consistent with FDA regulations that would not strip POM of its right to prove a willful Lanham Act violation.

But this is a case involving a different statute. Our submission is that it is entirely irrelevant whether or not the Coke label, in any particular, is consistent with a regulation that implements criminal prohibitions by announcing when and under what limited circumstances the FDA will forebear from exercising its criminal and regulatory penalties.

And the question is whether Congress gave any indication and it would have to, in this context where the Lanham Act is an express statutory enactment that Congress was well aware of when it enacted the Nutrition Labeling Act and, in fact, was told, not just by the industry, but by OMB, in testimony, that the Lanham Act was being used to police misrepresentations of the character of food products, you would have to conclude that Congress intended to allow the FDA to supply, if you will, the substantive rule of decision under a different statute that uses different words and ­­ and protects a different class of people when ­­ and here again, I think it's an important indicator why Congress didn't mean that. The FDA, the misbranding provisions of the FDCA are prohibitions. They are not permissions. And the rules that the FDA has promulgated announce essentially an enforcement forbearance. They don't represent a judgment and the Federal Register provisions that we've cited that accompanied the promulgation of the juice naming regulations make this as clear as day. They do not represent a pronouncement that for all purposes, for all statutes, the name on ­­ the name ascribed to the product is okay. In fact, they say although for purposes of our forbearance under our government enforcement authority, we will allow you to do one or the other ­­ and this is 2919 and 2920 of Federal Register 58, We warn manufacturers that even compliance with this, where there is a small amount of the non­predominant juice name has great capacity to mislead and we encourage ­­ twice in the rulemaking, we encourage manufacturers, nonetheless, to name the juices in the product. Under those circumstances, the notion that Congress intended this type of regulation to preclude a case in which ­­ and these are the facts as the Court ­­ as they come to the Court ­­ Coke well knew and intentionally designed a label that, in fact, grossly misleads consumers to the economic disadvantage of the company that, in large part, created the market. And the notion that Congress wanted to allow the FDA to apply substantive rules of decision in that very different inquiry using very different language in a different statute, I think, is completely unsupported. I mean ­­",
  "Well, we have in ­­ in the course of our complaint, we didn't specify ­­ I mean, the injunction that we would seek is ceasing to use the label as it currently exists, and of course ­­",
  "That's correct. It's just as in criminal actions under the FDCA and civil actions under parallel state laws and actions under the Lanham Act, juries aren't required or permitted to give prescriptive judgments. All that they may ­­ all they do is make a judgment about whether or not on balance, there is substantial evidence that to the harm of the competitor, a substantial number of consumers are misled, and if so, was it willful. And that is no more of a problem in this particular case than it is in any of these cases, whether they involve food or anything else. In Wyeth versus Levine, the plaintiff had all sorts of reasons ­­ all sorts of different theories about what the warning label should or shouldn't say. The jury simply decided that it violated the common law of the state of Vermont to use that particular label. And the FD ­­ I'm sorry.",
  "It's hard to see how we would have a ­­ it's hard to see how we would have a ­­ could possibly prevail in a Lanham Act case. I mean, we have to come up with ­­ we have to adduce, it's our burden, substantial evidence to show that a substantial number of competitors ­­ of consumers are not only misled, but misled to the detriment of our product. I don't think we could establish it. But Coke's argument, and for that matter the government's argument, with respect to the name itself, would apply if, unlike the eyedropper's worth of pomegranate juice that's in the half­gallon bottle, there were two microns. I mean, this ­­ the question simply is whether a manufacturer like Coca­Cola can design something that it knows runs a substantial risk, quote, \"from a misleading perspective.\" And the evidence shows that over a third of consumers who look at this label believe that pomegranate and blueberry juice, in fact, are the majority juices.",
  "Well, of course, pome ­­ the only thing that consumers know is that ­­ from the front label is that there is pomegranate ­­ arguably pomegranate juice and blueberry juice in here. So the question would be whether they had to disclose on the label whether there was also .01 percent strawberry juice or 99.4 percent apple and grape juice. That's the kind of judgment that we want the FDA to make, because the purpose of the FDCA is protect public health and safety. What the FDA doesn't do, particularly given the criminal nature of its sanctions, is regulate or interpret, apply its forbearance authority with an eye toward, well, what kinds of things are going to so mislead consumers that they think there is going to be a substitute in the marketplace where there isn't.",
  "Well, I think the vast ­­ presumably, and we're talking about a hypothetical regulation, presumably the FDA would promulgate a requirement that, in fact, you must name each of the ­­ each of the constituent juices in case there is an allergy. I mean, we wouldn't have an objection ­­ the argument wouldn't be that consumers are misled by that fact alone. What's misleading consumers here is they have no way on God's green earth of telling that the total amount of blueberry and pomegranate juice in this product can be dispensed with a single eyedropper. It amounts to a teaspoon in a half gallon. And the FDA has ­­ the FDA has explained in this case that it has no expertise, it has no warrant to interpret or understand or apply judgments about what kind of words and symbols and the combination thereof, to use the language of the Lanham Act, will have a tendency to misrepresent the nature or quality of the goods from the perspective of the competitor. And that's ­­",
  "We think it certainly would not be preempted under state law. The state law provision, Justice Kennedy, is Section 110660 of the California Health and Safety Code, which ­­ the language of which is in haec verba with the very first subsection of the misbranding statute 343(A), which declares misbranded any label which is false in particular ­­ false and misleading in any particular. That subsection is not even the subject ­­ it's excluded from the limited preemption provisions of the NLEA. So it certainly wouldn't be preempted. There might be an open question if one of the things that we were challenging in the course of that state lawsuit was the name itself, and the question then would be is this name, in fact, compliant with the FDA regulation? Now, we've explained in our brief that there are three reasons why it is not compliant. And the United States agrees that a remand would be appropriate in any case to determine whether it is compliant. But generally speaking, our state law claim wouldn't be preempted at all. Not only is it parallel to the misbranding provision, but the provision that it's parallel to is not preempted. Unless the Court has further questions, I would like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I need to correct a few misstatements by my colleague, Ms. Sullivan. First of all, this three­year study that she's referring to, as we pointed out in our brief, the IOM and the FDA made absolutely clear repeatedly in that study that they did not look at FDA's enforcement capabilities, its enforcement efforts. It had ­­ it simply was a judgment about whether the specific forbearance regulations that they promulgated, in fact, adequately accomplished what Congress's objectives were. Number two, we ­­ we are not saying that this is a misbranded product. We are not trying to enforce the FDCA. And the FD ­­ and the FDA itself has made clear, not only in its brief in this case and not only in its enforcement action in the Nestle case, but in the Federal Register discussion of the juice naming regulation, that the fact that the juice may comply ­­ and here it probably doesn't ­­ may comply with the naming convention does not mean that it is misleading. The FDA said over and over again in that rulemaking that we strongly caution manufacturers that, in fact, mere compliance with this does not mean that the label is misleading and ­­ and that manufacturers are under an obligation to ensure that the label is not misleading. Now, as to the question of ­­",
  "That is in 58 ­­ the statements that I'm quoting are in 58 Federal Register, Pages 2900, 2919, and 2920.",
  "And also, indeed said, nonetheless, we encourage manufacturers to name all of the juices in a multiple juice product specifically because it was concerned about this. Now, Ms. Sullivan says, well, you know, not all Lanham Act claims are preempt ­­ precluded. They wouldn't be precluded if the parallel cognate state law enforcement of an identical standard wouldn't be precluded. This is ­­ the closest cognate here is 343(a), which provides that a food is misbranded if it is false ­­ if the label is false and ­­ false or misleading at any particular. That isn't in this sort of Swiss cheese exception ­­ exemption­filled preemption provision of the NLEA. That one isn't preempted. There is nothing whatsoever that preempts any person from going into state court and enforcing a state law provision that recites in haec verba 343(a). Now, Ms. Sullivan says, okay, we're not worried here. The FDA wasn't worried here about health or safety. That's not what's going on here. That is the point. That is the point. It's because there were concerns about health and safety with this juice naming regulation that they said, in the exercise of our sovereign enforcement authority, we are not going to go after you for complying with this naming convention, because, as they've explained, we don't know anything about how to protect competitors. We don't purport to know what is in the competitive marketplace. And we aren't about writing regulations under these criminal provisions. And Ms. Sullivan is right. There are civil enforcement mechanisms, but they're all enforced by juries. We aren't going to go this way because this is not our job. It's not our expertise. And yet, interesting ­­",
  "Very definitely, and for ­­ for some of the reasons that this Court discussed in the Lexmark case, where you were talking about who can sue under the Lanham Act and who's protected. And the Court noted that, of course, consumer confusion itself can be the engine for a competitive harm. But the former is not what the Lanham Act is about, and the latter, the FDA has made perfectly clear is not what the FDCA is about. And interestingly, even with respect to this naming provision, and, you know, we ­­ the government agrees with us far more than it disagrees with us, but our disagreement about the preclusive effect of their judgment is important. You know, they say, okay, we ­­ we spent a lot of time on these regulations, and we are entitled to chevron deference. And we think they are entitled to Chevron deference with respect to interpreting the misbranding provisions that they are in fact ­­ that they do enforce. They're asking as ­­ their submission here is not ­­ not ­­ not just in an FDA action, enforcement action in court, will we get chevron deference for our interpretation of what the meaning of 343(i)(1) is. But in a Lanham Act case, we get chevron on steroids deference. We get to basically keep you of out of court entire ­­ you're not even allowed to make that claim. That is an astonishing proposition, and it is one that there is nothing whatsoever in the legislative history, the language of the statute, anything at all to indicate that Congress wanted ­­",
  "Well, certainly not in the Lanham Act context. There's been no suggestion that they have anything whatsoever to say about the Lanham Act. Knowing the professoriate, I'm sure there must be some commentary about whether they do or don't get chevron deference. But Ms. Sullivan says that they don't and the government says that they do. And there must be a scholar at least on each side of that position, but I simply don't know. I will make one final point.",
  "We certainly intend to say that if it becomes relevant, absolutely.",
  "Well, I ­­ right. I think that it doesn't apply at all. The government would take the position that it has preclusive authority. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Please make no mistake about what Limelight is asking you to do. Under Limelight's theory, two or more people can divide up and perform the steps of any method claim, however drafted, without liability. Imagine, for example, to go to the question ­­ Justice Ginsburg's question about business method patents, imagine a pretty common medical treatment claim. Let's assume that there is disclosure and patenting of a cure for cancer or a novel treatment for cancer that involves, as they often do, the administration of different drugs sequentially. And two parties get together and say, I'll administer Drug 1, you administer Drug 2, and we can take advantage of this marvelous patented process without paying anything ­­ giving anything whatsoever to the company that spent a billion dollars and 25 years developing this.",
  "Excuse me?",
  "It would not necessarily be a partnership. I mean, the fact of the matter is, that's ­­ there's no reason why it would have to be. We don't have to have a formal partnership. We don't have to have a formal ­­",
  "This is exactly, exactly the point here, which is that as this Court has taught, the Patent Act, and in particular 271(a), imports common law principles of liability unless the law, the Patent Act clearly can be read to exclude them. And the whole fight here, if you'll pardon me, on the 271(a) question, which is a predicate question to the 271(b) question, as it was in Arrow and Deepsouth and the Sony Betamax case, the 271(a) question is just which common law rules of attribution apply? Now, the Court ­­ the panel below said, well, we know ­­ there are only two rules that apply. One is if there is a binding contractual obligation by each party to perform all the joint steps. And two, if there is a formal agency principal relationship. Those two are correct. At common law, there was attribution for tort liability, whether it was strict negligence or intentional, under those circumstances, but ­­ and you can consult any of the treatises that we cite at pages 25 through 27 of our brief ­­ there were all ­­ there also was a well ­­ there were well­recognized attribution doctrine that applied where there was direction and control. That is, one party directed or controlled the other, which is the basis on which the jury found liability here, and also where the parties were engaged in a concerted action or a common plan. And, Justice Scalia, to your point about, you know, people could be inadvertently liable, even if they didn't know about all the steps or they didn't know each other, the common law didn't accommodate those circumstances. The common law required, across tort law, whether a strict liability tort law like trespass, libel, conversion, patent infringement, required not that you know about and intend to violate the patent, but in order to be ­­ have another party's conduct attributed to you, you had to know about the other party's conduct.",
  "You know, let me just say ­­",
  "Let me just say, Justice Scalia, that the proposition that they've asserted, and I gather that you're giving ­­ you're crediting in their reply brief, that where the underlying tort is strict liability, the attribution rules have to be these formal nonknowledge rules. They don't have ­­ they have not cited a single case in support of that proposition. There is no logical reason why it would necessarily be true, and I can give you cases that suggest ­­ that quite definitely suggest the other, including a patent case that all the parties have been ­­ Liddy have been writing about, which is Jackson vs. Nagle. That was a case in which there was an infringement of a method patent where some of the steps were performed by a contractor and some of the steps were performed by the subcontractor, and there is no respondeat superior in the common law for contractor/subcontractor relationship. The Court found them both individually liable, even though neither completed all the steps under what the Court called principles of joint liability.",
  "Well, I mean, look, before I came here this morning, using my smartphone, I'm sure that technically I performed the last step of probably 15 different method patents. Consumers aren't sued under patent law for infringement, whether there's a single user or multiple users.",
  "No, no, not at all. Quite to the contrary. The consumer ­­ first of all, consumers aren't sued, because under the patent law, under like ­­ under ­­ unlike copyright law, there are no liquidated damages. No one sues individual consumers. The consumers, the customers in this case are big companies like Microsoft and CNN and ESPN who operate these websites using the patented method through Limelight services. But more to the point here, Justice Kennedy, the point is that there ­­ at common law, there was no liability absent knowledge about who was doing all of the other steps. And that was the protection that existed. You could always send a letter to people saying, You may not have known about it in the past, but now you know about it. That rendering plant that you built turns out to be part of a ­­ together with many other pollution­emitting sources constitutes a nuisance, a strict liability, often a strict liability crime. And now that you know about it, you're liable. And that's ­­ that was the law. That was the rule. But I think the consequences here to consumers, if you're talking about consumers rather than the ­­ the parties that knowingly, under Limelight's direction, performed a critical step in the patented method, were not traditionally sued. They were not traditionally liable, and it was the ­­ A, the absence of ­­ of knowledge of what everybody else was doing. I mean, the consumer in your hypothetical, Justice Kennedy, may get a letter saying, Well, we have a patent on, you know, what Nokia's phone does, and you're infringing it. At common law, there would be no attribution to you of all the steps that ­­ of what Nokia was otherwise doing, unless you knew specifically the specific steps of the claim method that were being patented. And so in this whole discussion about, you know, is the only question before the Court 271(b), or is there 271(a) imported, I'm going to leave to side the question of whether you should or shouldn't grant our pending conditional cross­petition, and assuming you don't want to do it. You should address ­­ I mean, you could affirm the Federal Circuit on the theory that it adopted, and I am prepared to defend it because I think it was correct. But at a minimum, we think in order to provide a full analysis under 271(b) and to provide, heaven knows, much needed guidance in this area ­­ and let me just say that Mr. Panner is brilliant, but his math on the court below is wrong. There were four judges on the En Banc Court who disagreed with us on direct liability. The five in the majority took no position. They said that they had no occasion to address it at this time.",
  "I think, both the Government and ­­ at the petition stage, both the Government and Limelight took pains to point out that if you simply reverse and don't grant the cross­petition, the Federal Circuit will have in front of it the question on which it granted en banc review and vacated the panel decision. But I would go farther. No matter if you ­­ if you affirm either on 271 grounds on its own right or 271 grounds using an analysis similar to what you did in Aro and Deepsouth and the Sony Betamax case, which was to say, okay, we have a question presented that poses a question of indirect liability. But indirect liability depends on direct liability, and we are not simply going to assume, for argument's sake, this artificial assertion that there is no direct liability.

  "No idea ­­",
  "Justice Breyer, let me answer the question and then ­­ and get to my ­­ the point I was trying to make in response to Justice Kennedy's question. This case is not complicated. This case involves a four­ or five­step method in which Limelight performs all but one or two of the steps and tells its customers, if you want to use our service, you have to perform the other step. Here's exactly how you do it. We have somebody 24 hours a day, seven days a week assigned to you to help make sure you do it the right way. And the question in this case is whether that constitutes, under 271(a), as the jury found and the judge denied JMOL under the law that existed at the time, all of the steps were performed at ­­ the steps ­­ the step that Limelight's customers performed were at the direction ­­",

  "Yes, I can. May I just answer ­­ finish answering Justice Kennedy's question before I forget it, which I am greatly in ­­ in danger of doing? The point here, Justice Kennedy, is whether you would affirm here on 271(b) grounds or (a) grounds, the result will be exactly the same. We are not expanding the relief that we are requesting this Court to grant, because even if you just affirm on (b), just say the Federal Circuit was right, either because it's theory is right or because we think that the common law attribution rules are broader than the Court ­­ the panel previously had thought, the result is going to be a remand to decide a quest ­­ the question of infringement under 154(1) and 271(a) because there ­­ as they ­­ as Limelight points out like on every third page of its briefs, there is an unresolved pending appellate challenge to the jury's finding that Limelight's customers, in fact, practiced the tagging step. So they are going to have to address on remand a ­­ the question of whether or not there is direct infringement, whether direct infringement occurred.",
  "Well, Justice Kagan, first of all, I mean, if it were a real problem, the Court could order supplemental briefing. It could order, as it did in Kiobel order supplemental briefing and have a reargument in the fall either on our cross­petition or in the predicate question. But it's not quite as unfair as you think. The question on which the case was briefed and argued ­­ the only question briefed and argued by the parties and 22 amici in the Federal Circuit en banc proceedings was the 271(a) question.

  "Infringe ­­",
  "That's not our submission. There's no question that there has ­­",
  "I don't ­­ the principle that the ­­ let me ­­ the answer is no. What is new is the 2008 ­­ beginning in 2008 jurisprudence in the Federal Circuit on 271(a) that unnaturally limited the common law attribution rules. The (b) decision is not new because, and I say this because the principle is certainly as the majority said below, you cannot have liability for inducement or contributory infringement unless there is direct infringement. That is tautological. No one disagrees with that. Infringement in the Patent Act is defined in section ­­ what is now Section 154(a)(1), but was, in fact, the entire metes and bounds of the patent laws starting in the Patent Act of 1836, which is that ­­ and this Court itself has called it the foundational definition of infringement. 154(a)(1) says that, a, you know, a patent holder has the exclusive right to make, sell, use, or offer to sell his invention during the term of the patent. That's what sets out the metes and bounds of the property right. And any encroachment on that property right is a infringement. And therefore, because there ­­ the jury found that all the ­­ I know there's an outstanding question on appeal, but the jury found that every step of ­­ there was an encroachment in this case, there was an infringement. And the common ­­ the patent law, as well as the common law, was very, very clear that whether the underlying conduct was conducted by one person or two people or three people, the party that induced those people to do it was liable. And I would ­­ if you're asking for authority, I don't think that there's a better authority than ­­ well, I'll give you three really good ones, not necessarily in order of importance. The Robinson 1890 treatise on patents which this Court has repeatedly referred to, says point blank and cites authorities for that proposition; so similarly, the Walker treatise; and finally this Court's decision ­­ this Court's opinion last month in United States versus Rosemond, which was a criminal aiding and abetting case, but in the course of the ­­ of the Court's discussion, the Court explains that look, let's take a kidnapping example and let's say that someone is abducted, but the abduction occurs as a result of four people just basically getting together and saying, you know, you provide the home or the warehouse ­­",
  "Well, I'm on thin ice indeed, Justice Kagan, in ­­ in arguing with you or dialoguing with you about what Rosemond ­­ the Rosemond opinion involved. But let me take a valiant step in any event. What this Court said was that from the perspective ­­ and ­­ and the two treatises that this Court cited also say this ­­ from the perspective of the victim, which is the perspective that the Court used in the example and is the perspective that the common law of torts takes, there was an encroachment upon rights. Now, what this Court said in its discussion is none of those four people are liable for kidnapping as a principal, but they are all liable under the common plan analysis for indirect liability. And that is ­­ this ­­ what is really most notable about the common law is ­­ and the early patent cases ­­ is how assiduously, going back at least through the 19th Century, the courts worked to make sure that where there was an invasion of the property or personal right, either in criminal law or in civil tort law, that parties that cooperated with each other or a party that was directing other parties to do it were held liable whether one person did elements A, B, C, or D or not.",
  "Justice Kagan, no. The Federal Circuit's law as announced by the majority below is that you have (b) liability when there is infringement as defined by 154(1). And here the patent law and the common law ­­",
  "You can certainly have infringement without an actionable infringer, absolutely. Under anybody's rule you can do that. The whole debate we have with the other side on the (a) question is how ­­ what attribution rules do or don't apply. But if you have an example, to take Justice ­­ one of the things that's bother ­­ one of the ­­ one small part of what's bothering Justice Breyer, you have a situation where however many steps there are and however many parties there are, there are some parties that don't know about each other or what they're doing. In those circumstances, the common law doesn't apply liability, and therefore, you would have an instance in which there could be an infringement under 154(1) in the sense that all of the steps of the patented method are performed, but there will be no liability because the performers were not acting in concert or at the direction or control of each other. And that's ­­ that's why I think what the Federal Circuit did on its own terms is not novel. It accepted the proposition that you can't have inducement liability unless there is an infringement, unless there is a tort, and ­­",
  "No, no, not at all. I'm sorry, I ­­ no, no.",
  "No, absolutely. Under Global­Tech, there's no liability under 271(b) unless there is an intent by the inducer to, in fact, violate ­­ infringe the patent. So to give you an ­­ a prosaic example. Let's say ­­",
  "In our example, no. I mean, there's no facts here to suggest that ­­ that Limelight's customers even ­­ forget knowing about the patent, they don't even know what steps Limelight is taking. All they know is Limelight is saying, hey, if you use our service and you provide our pointer or our ­­ or our tag, we'll provide you all of this content instantaneously. So there is no liability, although there is liability because there is knowledge on the part of Limelight which is asking its customers to ­­ telling its customers to do exactly what Akamai is asking and telling its customers to do. So, in short, we think that the Federal Circuit ­­ the en banc Federal Circuit is correct even on its own terms because there was an act of infringement in this case. There was infringement in the sense that all of the steps of the patented method were performed, whether or not there is an attribution rule that would apply liability to one or more of those parties under 271(a).",
  "Inducing an infringement. And I'll give you a concrete example. Let's say that there's a five­step patented method that I know about, and I convince ­­ I induce Mr. Panner to do steps 1, 2, and 3 and Ms. Anders to do steps 4 and 5. If I'm doing that because I know about the patent and I want to take advantage of their otherwise innocent performance collectively of the steps, at common law and at patent law, it was uncontroversial that I was liable. I was responsible. Just ­­ I don't want to belabor the Rosemond point because I have a skeptical author looking at me, but the common law made ­­ the cases going back made clear that there was no escape from liability even though neither Mr. Panner nor Ms. Anders may be directly liable if they didn't know that each other was doing the steps or otherwise cooperate with each other. And that's what this case is. And that's why the Federal Circuit's decision on its own terms is correct. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.",

That violates the Sixth Amendment under Ring. In Florida, and Florida alone, what authorizes imposition of the death penalty is a finding of fact by the Court of an aggravating factor, a finding that the trial judge makes independently, and, quote, \"notwithstanding the jury's recommendation as to sentence.\" Now, the State here contends that capital sentencing juries make implicit findings that satisfy the Sixth Amendment under Ring, which the trial judge then simply ratifies. That is wrong. Whatever the jury's recommendation might imply about the specified aggravating factors, the Florida Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected the notion that the jury's verdict is anything other than advisory. Florida law entrusts the factual findings of aggravators to the judge alone, who may do so on the basis of evidence that the jury never heard, and aggravators that the jury was never presented with.",

  "Well, we don't ever know what the jury found about any of the specified aggravating circumstances. The only thing that the jury tells the judge is, we recommend life­slash­death by a vote of X versus Y.",
  "Well, no. No. As a matter of State law, that's not correct. They can't recommend death unless seven of them each believe that some aggravator is satisfied.",
  "But the Florida Supreme Court ­­ and this is a ­­ this is a ­­ another Ring problem here. The Florida Supreme Court has recognized that where two aggravators are presented, it is impossible to know, even if a simple majority agreed on a single aggravator.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, Florida, and ­­ Florida is the only State ­­ the only death penalty State and therefore the only State that does not require or permit the jury to be told that it has to agree. And in all other States it's unanimous, but even has to ­­ cannot even be told that a majority have to agree as to the existence of one of the specified aggravating factors.",
  "It ­­",
  "We're talking here, Mr. Chief Justice, about elements of the crime. And as this Court explained in Ring, the existence of a statutory aggravating factor is an element of a death­eligible crime. And can anybody imagine a world, which would be the analogue in Florida, if the jury at the guilt/innocence phase of any trial, a shoplifting trial, were told, now, look. I'm the one who will decide whether the defendant is or isn't guilty as a matter of law, and ­­ and eligible for punishment. But I'd like your input on what you ­­ whether you think each of the specified elements is or isn't satisfied. I mean, that ­­ nobody would stand for an argument like that ­­",
  "­­ or a system like that.",
  "The jury ­­ if they are distinct elements, and this ­­ this implies the Schad point that the State is raising: If the State, consistent with a long historical tradition and a finding of equal culpability, chooses to permit a particular element in Schad, it was premeditation, or the mental state to be satisfied either by premeditation or by felony murder, that's fine. But that is not the Florida system. Florida requires as a matter of law ­­ and the Florida Supreme Court has said this over and over again ­­ that a defendant is eligible for death only if the trial judge finds as fact, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a particular statutory aggravator exists. And I submit, even if that were not the case, extending Schad, which held that in light of a hundred­and­fifty­year history of States including in the mental element for first degree murder, either felony murder or premeditation, that combining those two elements didn't satisfy the death penalty. None of that is here. This is a question of the Sixth Amendment and the Eighth Amendment. No State ever has said that the jury can just decide some model of aggravation. They just ­­ they don't agree on the specific element, and that would violate, I think, the Sixth and Eighth Amendment precedents.",
  "Just ­­",
  "Justice Scalia, I'm reminded of your separate opinion ­­ I think it was in Walton v. Arizona ­­ where you were choosing between two things that you didn't particularly like, and one of them was the fact that the Court had made, recently or not, had made a finding of a ­­ beyond a reasonable doubt, a factual finding of a specified aggravating factor an element of the crime. And whether it's recent, whether the court should or shouldn't have done it, it has. And it ­­ under Ring, it is just like any other element of the crime. And on the Schad point, I think the other thing I would have said is, the Florida Supreme Court ­­ and I'll refer the case ­­ the Court to the Bevel case ­­ the Florida Supreme Court has said that the 16 aggravating factors that it ­­ that makes one eligible for death are vastly incommensurate, in terms of relative levels of ­­",
  "­­ moral ability, opposite of the predicate of Schad.",
  "Oh, I'm not ­­ I ­­ I wouldn't be prepared to say ­­ to assign weight to either of them. I think Ring is certainly predicated on Gregg, to Justice Scalia's point. If Gregg hadn't decided that ­­ that there has to be a determinate, specific appellate reviewable narrowing of trial ­­ sentencing jury's discretion, Ring wouldn't come up, because an aggravating factor wouldn't be an element.",

  "Well ­­",
  "Well, six ­­",
  "I ­­ we think, for the reasons stated in our brief, you should overrule it. And particularly in the Eighth Amendment context where the question is death, the jury should be unanimous. I mean, there is no other State that permits anyone to be sentenced for death other than a unanimous determination by the jury. And the State of Florida requires unanimity for shoplifting, just not for death. It requires unanimity on all the other elements of the crime. Now, even ­­ Apodaca's is a ­­ is an unusual decision, as Justice ­­",
  "Yes. And conviction ­­",
  "Justice ­­",
  "Justice Scalia ­­ exactly. And, Justice Scalia, leaving aside our Eighth Amendment point in our brief that ­­ that followed on Justice Breyer's concurrence in Ring, the ­­ this is all about the eligibility, not the determination of what sentence applies. And you have held that the existence of a specified statutory aggravating factor is a condition. It is an element of capital murder, and it is, by statute and Florida Supreme Court decision, an element of capital murder in Florida. And in Apodaca itself, which, as ­­ as Justice Thomas pointed out in McDonald, is an extraordinarily unusual case, even there, six justices indicated that a simple majority rule would not pass muster. I mean, we need to ­­ once a ­­ at ­­ when ­­ when an assignment is made to a jury in a case to decide beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of an element, however the State defines the element, we need substantial reliability that the jury actually performs those functions. And in this case ­­ and, again, in this case, if it were true that the sentencing jury was actually determining death eligibility, which it is plainly not, as we point out, the Eighth Amendment would certainly be violated under Caldwell, because this ­­ Florida juries are told that they do not determine death eligibility. And the State simply can't have it both ways. Either the jury is correctly told that its role is merely advisory, in which case there is a Ring violation, or the instruction that it's given violates the Eighth Amendment under Caldwell, because, as in Caldwell, it misleadingly, quote, \"minimizes the jury's sense of responsibility for determining the appropriateness of death.\"",
  "I think it's not so. It's probably a reason why ­­ for ­­ I mean, the heinous, atrocious, and cruel aggravator can never be obvious. And the State isn't even arguing harmlessness with respect to that. And as to robbery, I think it's important to ­­ to recognize the following: The State made a choice. They didn't even indite Timothy Hurst for robbery. The sentencing jury was not even instructed on the elements of robbery. This argument of harmlessness was never raised in these proceedings from the sentencing proceeding onward, including in the brief in opposition in this case, until the Red brief, and even there the Red brief is simply arguing that there was a fatal concession. But in any event, Justice Ginsburg, there is evidence in the record from which a jury could certainly find that Timothy Hurst, although he was found guilty of first­degree murder, did not, in fact, actually commit the robbery. The jury was told that to find the existence of the felony murder aggravator, it had to find ­­ and I believe this is on Page 211 of the Joint Appendix ­­ that it had to find that the murder was committed while he ­­ in the course of him committing a robbery. All of the physical evidence in this case that relates to the robbery, the ­­ the ­­ the bank deposit slip, the money, the bank deposit envelope, and a piece of paper in Lee­Lee Smith's handwriting toting up the proceeds were all found in Lee­Lee Smith's possession. And so, although it is not this Court's ordinary function to determine whether something was or wasn't harmless, as in Ring it was remanded for that purpose, I think in this case it manifestly was not harmless. And if there were a remand or any question by this Court on that count, it ought to be remanded to the State court, not only to determine constitutional harmlessness, but whether there was a waiver by the State in its deliberate choice never to mention this either to the second sentencing jury or thereafter.",
  "Correct.",
  "Because there were ­­ there were ­­ there was an eyewitness from across the street who testified that he saw somebody go into the Popeye's, and he positively identified the defendant.",
  "Now, I believe there was another cooperator who backed up Lee­Lee Smith's testimony.",
  "Certainly.",
  "Yes. And, in fact ­­",
  "That's correct.",
  "Well, that's what the jury was instructed.",
  "The jury was instructed that in order to find the felony murder aggravator, it had to find that the murder was committed in the course of him committing the robbery.",
  "Yes.",
  "But the ­­ the statute, the actual aggravator, is different. But that is what this jury was told.",
  "Okay. You're ­­ you're asking only about the Sixth Amendment and not the Eighth Amendment ­­",
  "­­ point. Okay. So the ­­ so just to be sure that I'm specifically answering your question, if the jury is told, you must find ­­ for the defendant to be eligible for death, you must find beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of at least one of the statutory aggravating factors. And I would also say for Sixth Amendment purposes, you must either be unanimous or the vote must be at least ten to two. And then the jury does so find. And then you have the sort of belt­and­suspenders legal system that the State is positing that Florida has here where the judge can say, okay, I'm the one who does the sentence, so I can weigh the ags and the mits. I can't ­­ he is death eligible because the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that a statutory aggravator exists. But the judge can say, nonetheless, I'm giving life. There's nothing ­­ there's no violation of the Sixth Amendment in ­­ when that happens. The question is, in this case, when the sentencing jury has concluded its work ­­ I mean ­­ and I'm assuming in a case where there's not a conviction for a prior aggravated felony. When the sentencing jury has concluded its work, is the defendant eligible for the death penalty under State law? Yes or no. And in Florida, the answer is unquestionably no. Even if we knew that 12 of the jurors found the robbery aggravator here, there would be a Ring violation, just as if we knew that 12 of the jurors found that he had killed the defendant in this case, but they had been told, I just want your input on this because I, the judge, will decide this.",
  "The jury, no.",
  "At a minimum, if, in fact, the jury is performing that function, it cannot, at least in a capital case, be told that it is not performing that function, that its advice is ­­ that its verdict is only advisory.",
  "If the ­­ I mean, there is no constitutional violation ­­ our view ­­ and this again is, is Justice Breyer's Eighth Amendment point, which we endorse. Our view is that capital sentencing always has be ­­ has been and, as a matter of constitutional law, should be done by a jury. We're not arguing that other sentences have to be jury sentencing. And so if a jury ­­ if a jury says it's death, and the judge says, well, I disagree, I'm only going to sentence him to life, there's no constitutional violation.",
  "Well ­­",
  "So, Justice ­­ Justice Alito, let me separate out what I'm calling the selection decision, that is, life or death and the weighing of ags and mits and the eligibility decision, which is all of the elements of capital murder have been found by ­­ beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury with either unanimously or a sufficient majority, and, therefore, when the sentencing jury is done, you are eligible for the death penalty. Leaving aside the Eighth Amendment question whether the Constitution then require ­­ requires the jury to make the intensely moral judgment about whether the penalty should be life without parole or death, assuming that a judge can do that, so long as the jury is not told that its input, which is how the Florida Supreme Court has put it, is ­­ so long as they are not told that it's advisory, so long as they are told that you as the finders of fact have to find that beyond a reasonable doubt that this capital crime was committed, which includes the following elements, including one of the two specifying aggravators, the Constitution is satisfied. The ­­ the Caldwell problem is an Eighth Amendment problem. Caldwell was an Eighth Amendment case. And in Caldwell what ­­ I mean what the jury is told here ­­ if the system exists as the State posits it, what the jury is told here is far more misleading than what was told in Caldwell. In Caldwell, the jury was simply told at closing argument that your decision is going to be reviewable by the Mississippi Supreme Court. And a majority of this Court held that that unconstitutionally diminished the jury's responsibility. Here the jury was told over and over and over again, and consistent with Florida law, that your judgment is merely advisory; I will be the one to make this determination. And either ­­ if that isn't ­­ that does appear to be the system, that violates Ring. If it isn't the system and if somehow it can be argued that the jury is making implicit findings of aggravation at large, that renders somebody eligible for death, then there is a plain Caldwell problem. And that ­­ that's our position. May I reserve the balance of my time?",
  "Thank you.",
  "Notwithstanding this flurry of papers, I'm aspiring not to use the six minutes. Let me first ­­ let me go right to Justice Scalia's question, which is not a hypothetical, although I'm happy to answer hypotheticals. Your question was: Was the jury told and doesn't a jury have to be told that as to death eligibility, the element of the crime of capital murder, that it makes the decision? The answer is: It does have to be told that. It certainly can't be told the opposite, and it absolutely was not told that. It was told over and over again, consistent with the statute, that its decision was purely advisory. And I want to refer the Court to the Florida Supreme Court's decision in State v. Steele, which is at 921 So. The Florida Supreme Court in Steele said, first of all, \"Nothing in the statute, the standard jury instructions, or the standard verdict form requires a majority of the jury to agree on which aggravating circumstances exist. Under current law, the jury may recommend a sentence of death where four jurors believe only that one aggravator applies, while three others believe that only another aggravator applies, because seven jurors believe that at least one aggravator applies.\" Florida goes beyond that. It ­­ it is unlawful ­­ and the Supreme Court of Florida has said ­­ to require ­­ to ask the jury, the sentencing jury, to provide a special verdict that in any way indicates what their, quote, input is on the sentencing factors. Again, Steele, at page 546. \"Specific jury findings on aggravators, without guidance about their effect on the imposition of a sentence, could unduly influence the trial judge's own determination of how to sentence the defendant. The trial court alone must make detailed findings about the existence and weight of aggravating circumstances.\"",
  "Yes, this is post Ring. And the Court also held that Ring didn't apply. It has no jury findings on which to rely. And, in fact, the Court also explained in ­­ later in the decision ­­ in the same decision and also in its decision in Franklin, that Florida bar ­­ quote, \"Florida bars a special verdict precisely because requiring specific jury findings on aggravators, without guidance about their effect, would harm the jury's independent\" ­­ \"the trial court's independent determination.\" Now, counsel ­­ my ­­ my colleague on the other side here says that, well, there ­­ there would not be a statutory problem, but there would be a Ring problem if we knew that the jury found that no aggravators existed. So how can Ring be satisfied when we have no earthly idea what the jury found? It could be, as in this case, as Steele acknowledges, three for one and four for the other. As to the, I think, hypothetical question that Justice Kagan was asking ­­ so, you know, in a circumstance, how much leeway does the judge have to make his own ­­ his or her own decisions on the death penalty, the Florida Supreme Court has specifically allowed the death penalty to be imposed and a determination of death eligibility to be made based on evidence that was never presented to the sentencing jury and based on an aggravating factor on which the sentencing jury was not applied. And the notion that there hasn't been a life­override since Ring is ­­ is an interesting fact, but this Court, in this Court's Sposiano decision, in this Court's Daubert decision, that's exactly what happened: The jury said, we want life. The judge said, I'm hearing ­­ I'm hearing independent evidence, and you're getting death. Now, as to the supposed concessions in this case, I think I'll rely largely on our brief. But the notion that somebody ­­ that the lawyers said this is a two­aggravator case is certainly true. There were two aggravators charged. And maybe the jury ­­ we know that the trial judge found that two aggravators were satisfied. This defendant has been making the Ring argument since before Ring was decided. He raised this as an Apprendi issue at the very first trial. He asked for a bill of particulars for the ­­ the State to indicate which aggravators it was going to rely on, and he was denied on the grounds that Apprendi doesn't apply. Even the ­­ again, the central Ring problem in this case, the central Sixth Amendment problem in this case, leaving aside the indeterminacy of seven to five ­­ and maybe it's three for one and four for the other ­­ is that, when a Florida sentencing jury finishes its work, there is simply no question: The defendant is not eligible for the death penalty. Only the trial judge can do that. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A signal goal of ERISA enacted in 1974 was to foster employee benefit plans that could operate nationally under nationally uniform rules of administration, first and foremost, rules about recordkeeping and reporting. Now, of course ERISA plans, like other regular businesses, are subject to ancillary regulation like maintaining a safe workplace, paying minimum wage and prevailing wage laws, paying their State real estate taxes on their headquarters, and if they choose to run a hospital, run a law firm for their legal services, benefit program, run a childcare center, they are subject to local regulation like other providers of those local services. But in every single case in this Court, and every lower court decision that I have found in which courts have upheld, State by State, reporting requirements, it has always been incident to a substantive obligation that the State could impose. And no one contends that Vermont could impose substantive regulations on the claims that Liberty Mutual pays under its employment plan. Now, I want to go to the point of ­­",
  "That is not true, Justice Kagan.

And the notion ­­ and that ­­",
  "Justice Ginsburg, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association has actually filed a brief in its ­­ in this case, and it explains at great detail, as does the brief of the multi­employer plans, which like Liberty Mutual operate in 50 States, about the burden, about the fact that Blue Cross Blue Shield doesn't have all this information in the normal course, the multi­employer plans don't have it, and Blue Cross Blue Shield, as a third­party administrator, has told this Court just exactly how burdensome and how expensive it is. Of course they could do it for Liberty Mutual in Vermont. The only question is how much it's going to cost and how much they're going to charge. But look, for example, at since this ­­ since this litigation began, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has now told Liberty Mutual that it wants reporting under its APCD statute. And as we recount at page 36 of our brief, their regulations require, among other things, the premiums the plan charges, its actuarial assumptions, the summary of its plan designs, the plan's reserves, its surplus, its provider payments, its provider levels, and information about medical procedures whose claims are denied. And the chart that we submitted in the district court reflects the wide variation in States. There is ­­ the ­­ the burden that Congress foresaw is coming to play before our very eyes as States ­­ more and more States adopt these mandatory plans.",
  "No, it is not. Absolutely not. And the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association amicus brief reports that. The multi­employer plan brief reports that they only ­­ that their plans generally have about 70 to 80 percent of the information that's required by any one of these States. And to go to ­­ I think it was Justice Breyer's hypothetical ­­ look, the same rules that apply here are going to apply to pension plans. And the State of Vermont, like many other States now, is concerned not just about health care costs and delivering good health care outcomes, but it's concerned about the financial well­being of its senior citizens. And in fact, they've asked the Department of Labor to permit State ­­ States to operate their own ERISA pension plans for their residents. Now, they could pass a database statute that says, we're really concerned about whether elderly, you know, Vermonters are going to have enough money in their elder years, and we know that 93 million people are covered by employer pension plans, and we just want you to report ­­ you can pay whatever you want, but we want you to keep records and report to us about what your plan is and how much money people are going to have when they retire. Every single dollar ­­",
  "Well, every ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "Just ­­",
  "Justice Breyer, I know how exciting it is to get in the middle of a jurisprudential debate between you and Justice Scalia.",
  "I'm ­­ my ­­ my fingers are tingling at the prospect. I am not sure ­­",
  "I am not sure that the Department of Labor has the regulatory authority to essentially excuse the preemption provision, but ­­ and you don't have to just go to the provision of ERISA that you quoted ­­ in 1024(a)(2)(B) of ERISA, it authorizes the Secretary of Labor to require the production of, quote, \"any information or data from an ERISA plan where he finds that such data or information is necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter.\" And adverting to Justice Alito's comments, in the ACCA, the Secretary has the authority to require the production of ­­ from plans of, quote, \"any other information as determined appropriate by the Secretary.\" So the notion that preemption here is sort of like an ­­ operates like an accordion ­­ if the Department of Labor has the authority to get it but hasn't chosen to exercise, it's not preempted; but if they did promulgate a regulation, either of your color or Justice Scalia's color, that it would be preempted ­­ is a crazy ­­ is a crazy notion.",
  "How to interpret this statute as to say that in exchange for blanket Federal regulation of these plans, now augmented in the context of health care plans by the Affordable Care Act, the ­­ by the Federal government, the States are preempted from regulating the core functions of what an ERISA plan does. And there is nothing more core than the payment of benefits. If the State is attempting to regulate, whether it's by substantively regulating or imposing a recordkeeping or reporting obligation about the very activity that defines it as an ­­ as an ERISA plan, the payment of benefits, that State law necessarily relates to, because it has a connection with, an ERISA plan. And frankly, it's pretty ironic that the Petitioner and the government claim on the one hand that it is so important to get this information from these plans because 60 percent of all citizens in the United States get their health care from these self­funded plans, and yet requiring them to keep the particular records that the State wants and to report it on a quarterly, annually, or monthly basis, has no relation to or connection with the plan. I don't understand how both of those thoughts can inhere at the same time.",
  "Okay. I ­­ I want to ­­ I want to come to the end and dispute that premise that you ­­ the end of your question. But if the ­­ if you look at this Court's cases that have set about to evaluate the burden, or at least included, as in the last section of Travelers, a section that says of course if this were terribly burdensome there might be another question, those are cases ­­ and it's Travelers, Dillingham, and De Buono. We all agree on that ­­ those were all cases in which there was a burden being placed on an entity that wasn't ­­ in Travelers it was hospitals; in De Buono it was hospitals; in Dillingham it was apprenticeship programs, all of which affected the price that ERISA plans might have to pay to get benefits or services from those kinds of providers. And so it took several sentences in each of those ­­ several paragraphs in each of those opinions even to explain how putting a tax on the non­Blue Cross insurance plans in Travelers, or respecting the prevailing wage rate in California, actually had an effect on any ERISA plan anyway, because they weren't regulation of the plans, per se. They were indirect regulations. And when the regulation is indirect, that is, it is not a regulation that is directed at the very activity that makes the plan an ERISA plan, you do look at burden. And indirect regulation obviously can occur. But if ­­ as this Court explained in the last section of Travelers, if it's too burdensome, it might be preempted. But where the regulation is direct, where the State is requiring reporting because the self ­­ because the self­insured plan is engaged in the very activity that brings it under ERISA that qualifies it as an ERISA plan, that obviously relates to and has a connection with the plan, and is preempted.",
  "I don't think that that's at all the case, Justice Ginsburg, and I don't want to be misunderstood about this. The State of Vermont, just to take one example: The database statute authorizes the relevant Secretary to obtain this information from everybody, not only who pays for health care in Vermont, but the hospitals and clinics that provide it. But the Secretary, the executive official has chosen not to require that information from hospitals and clinics and doctors in Vermont. There is also no doubt that if all­payer claims databases so badly need the information from self­funded plans, and it turns out that the self­funded plan ­­ a significant number of self­funded plans say no, that's preempted, the Federal government has all the authority it needs to get that information and require that that information be provided, either to the Secretary and then to the States, or directly to the States. And in fact, they can do what often happens in areas of field preemption and express preemption, which is to make it worth the plan's while. You know? They can offer all sorts of benefits to self­employed plans to provide this information if it's so important. What's interesting when we're talking about what is or isn't in the record in this case, is no explanation whatsoever from the State of Vermont at any stage as to why they haven't requested the actual providers of these health care services to provide the information and that it is inadequate. I mean, the ­­ the ­­ the only exchange I can recall is in the Second Circuit oral argument transcript, which is recorded and discussed in Judge ­­ Judge Straub's dissenting opinion, the State was asked, you know, look, how important is it to get the ­­ the ­­ the district judge ­­ I think it was the district judge ­­",
  "You know ­­",
  "No, you're not.",
  "It ­­ perhaps it's easier, but here's the point. And this is the insight of the ERISA preemption provision: The hospitals in Vermont, the clinics in Vermont, the medical practices in Vermont are not subject to varying regulation in 50 different States. They operate locally. They're subject to State regulation. Here, we're talking about plans that Congress wanted to encourage that would do something new, that would provide health care benefits and other employee benefits on a national basis, and in order to foster that, to subject them to a single set of reporting, recordkeeping, and regulatory obligations. And that, it seems to me, is the insight of ERISA. And it was the ­­ the bargain that ERISA plainly struck. I ­­ I simply noted in response to Justice Ginsburg's question that the State statute gives them the authority to do it. There aren't that many hospitals in Vermont. They already have all the information about what services are or aren't being provided. The State could have said, no, no, no. We absolutely can't get by without this. But the representation at oral argument in front of the judge, which has also been transcribed and is in the record, the State ­­ the lawyer representing the State ­­ the judge was sort of trying to settle this case and said, you know, how much do you really need this information? And the response was, we don't really need it. This is just a couple of employees. This is just one plan. But there's a principle here. And we agree with that. And we also agree with the representations of my friends on the other side that the question for this Court ­­ it has to take account of the possibility, which is the emerging reality, that all 50 States and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico will have their own mandatory all­payer claims databases that will require different things. And if I can just anticipate Justice Sotomayor's question reserved for rebuttal to ­­ to the State of Vermont, our brief explains, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield brief also explains, how there are ­­ of the hundreds of data fields that Vermont alone requires, there are dozens of them as to which there is no ICD ­­ whatever the ­­ the ­­ the agreed national format is. There are dozens and dozens of them as to which there is no HIPAA standard, no HIPAA guarantee of confidentiality. And this is just one State. If you look, as I said, at the Massachusetts APCD statute, which is the only other State that's actually come to Liberty Mutual so far, and look at our discussion of it on Page 36, the stuff that they are asking for is so obviously critical to what the plan does.",
  "I believe that ­­ I believe that the record shows that Blue Cross Blue Shield provides this information to Vermont, not only on behalf of itself as an insurer, but also some other ­­",
  "We don't know it. We were not able to get it from Blue Cross at the time the case was before the district judge. But in any event, as the Chief Justice's question suggests, the ­­ this issue doesn't end at Vermont. It ­­ it has to take account of a burden that Congress was very, very aware of, it was very cognizant of the regime under the Repeal Disclosure Act, and the costs of plans that are trying to be national plans complying with 50 different State regulations. And I really commend to the Court the amicus brief filed by the multi­employer plans in this case. These are plans that are essentially union­sponsored plans. They are not fancy plans. Every dollar that they have to spend comply ­­ gathering the data that each State ­­ that different States say they have to have comes directly out of the benefits that they can pay. Just as if ­­ if Vermont decides next week, if it wins this case, that it wants to get information about pension plans, and how they're being administered, and what benefits are being provided and not provided, those are all 100 percent self­funded plans. If my employer has to provide all that information, that is coming out of my 401(k) benefits.",

As I say, that's ­­ that's not what's going on here. And even if I'm wrong about it, it seems to me that this is quite different. You know, there is a lot of discussion on the other side of, you know, this just requires the press of a button and all the information goes. And our brief goes on for pages and pages, and the other amici ­­ amicus briefs show how that is so far from true. In order to comply with these, it's not just a question of saying, oh, yes, we paid Seth Waxman $300 in benefits last year. This requires that we keep records that we don't keep, and that we display them and provide information in ways that we don't, and that differ from one State to another. And for those reasons, unless the Court has questions, I will submit that the judgment should be affirmed."
