  "I think it's fitting to note that February 4th, last February 4th, marked the 200th anniversary of John Marshall's swearing in as the fourth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, as it then was called. I am quite convinced that Marshall deserves to be recognized along with George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson as one of the Founding Fathers of this country. Marshall served as Chief Justice from 1801 until 1835. He authored more than 500 opinions, including most of the important cases the Court decided during his tenure. Using his remarkable ability to reason from general principles to conclusions based on those principles, he derived from the Constitution a road map of how its checks and balances could be enforced in practice. I don't think I overstate the case to say that it is in large part because of Marshall's tenure on the Supreme Court that the third branch of our Government occupies the coequal position it does today. One occasionally hears the expression that an institution is the lengthened shadow of an individual. It may be risky to suggest that any institution which has endured for over 200 years, the way the Supreme Court of the United States has, could be the length and shadow of one individual, but surely there is only one individual who could possibly qualify for this distinction, and that is John Marshall. In honor of the 200th anniversary of John Marshall's appointment to the Court, our curator's office has put together an exhibit located near the statue of John Marshall on the ground floor.

  "I have to say that thinking about the case, I suppose analytically this is a prior restraint. And we have said that there s a heavy presumption within validity. But on the other hand, it s a content based time, place and manner regulation, and we have sustained these in case after case, and you want to make this a Freedman case. Freedman was a case where you had to submit your speech to prior examination, prior submission of speech, and it was in that context, and the Court was very clear, as I recall, in Freedman to say when -- there must be prior submission of speech, then you have to have the procedures Freedman set forth, so I think you're really stretching our precedents, particularly Freedman, to put Freedman in your case. It's true you may have some other arguments, if there were some content-based suppression going on, but this isn't a Freedman case. Our authorities just don't allow us to make that leap.",

  "Well, but that may be just a generic use of the term cases.",
  "The problem with your argument, Ms. Bergmann, seems to be addressed to the idea that Congress intended to sweep quite broadly here. But I don't think that's the necessary inference at all. We're dealing with a situation, as Justice O'Connor points out, where we have very rarely held that a decision is retroactive. So it's already a very small class of cases, and the Government's view makes it an even smaller class of cases. But that doesn't mean the statute doesn't work. It just means it doesn't work for a lot of people who are excluded from it.",

  "We'll hear argument next in Deneice A. Mayle v. Jacoby Lee Felix. Mr. Chan.",
  "Mr. Chan, do you think the Rules of Civil Procedure should be applied in habeas cases after AEDPA the same way they are in civil -- other civil litigation?",
  "But what if we were to determine that in regular civil litigation it is relatively automatic? What would your position be with respect to habeas cases after AEDPA?",
  "Very well, Mr. Chan. Ms. Blatt, we'll hear from you.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Blatt. Mr. Porter, we'll hear from you.",
  "Whatever the reason for it is, certainly you can interpret the rules to say that the pleading requirement being different and much more specific, the amendment process should be different.",
  "But you don't need an amendment, I don't think. If you're talking about a transaction, the question is, What is the transaction? And in habeas it may be quite different than in other civil things.",
  "What about -- what about the case law in the lower courts that Justice Breyer referred to, dealing with the core operative facts and adopting - -",
  "-- you say let's look at all the cases that have followed Tiller, and -- but apparently a lot of the courts adopting the core operative fact have developed that without full regard to Tiller.",
  "But the argument as to whether it was properly done, whether the ruling was proper, is going to go back to the time of the Miranda interrogation.",
  "Well, why isn't that an operative fact?",
  "Yes, but - -",
  "Well, you've switched. We were talking about \"operative fact,\" and now you said \"actionable fact.\"",
  "Thank you, Mr. Porter. Mr. Chan, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chan. The case is submitted. [Whereupon, at 11:57 a.m., the case in the",
  "We'll hear argument now in Margaret Bradshaw v. John David Stumpf. Mr. Cole.",
  "When -- when did this new evidence come to light?",
  "Did the other guy confess to a -- kind of a jailhouse snitch?",
  "Very well, Mr. Cole. Mr. Freedman, we'll hear from you.",
  "Who is they?",
  "What is your best case, Mr. Freedman, for the idea that an inconsistency, such as you say was present here, is a violation of due process?",
  "Did you raise that argument before the Sixth Circuit, the one that you're making now?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Freedman. Mr. Cole, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Cole. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument now in the Merck KGaA v. Integra Lifesciences. Mr. Rosenkranz.",
  "What are the alternative grounds that you're discussing now passed on by the Federal Circuit?",
  "A moment ago -- a moment ago, you were reading from 12(a). Was it the first sentence you were reading from?",
  "Thank you.",
  "Very well, Mr. Rosenkranz. Mr. Joseffer.",
  "Do you have to have the FDA's permission to start clinical testing?",
  "But who's fault is that that the jury instruction is too general. I mean, if both parties agreed to it, aren't they, in a sense, bound by it?",
  "The Petitioner said he agreed with the core of the instruction, whatever that is.",
  "What are the consequences if someone goes ahead and conducts a clinical trial without the approval of the FDA?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Joseffer. Mr. Flores.",
  "We're not reviewing the District Court's opinion. We granted certiorari as to the particular question which will deal with what was the Court of Appeals opinion. We don't ordinarily simply compare the Court of Appeals' opinion with the District Court's opinion to see if they parse.",
  "They spent about ten pages in the appendix trying to do that.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Flores. Mr. Rosenkranz, you have two minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Rosenkranz. The case is submitted. [Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the",
  "We'll hear argument next in Graham County Soil & Water Conservation District v. the United States. Mr. Browning.",
  "Very well, Mr. Browning. Mr. Hurt, we'll hear -- we'll hear from you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Hurt. Mr. Driemeier, we'll hear from you.",
  "Well, apparently Florida didn't think so.",
  "Apparently Florida didn't think it was too short.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Driemeier. Mr. Browning, you have 8 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Browning. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument now in Antonio Dwayne Halbert v. Michigan. Mr. Moran.",
  "Well, isn't that a perfectly natural inference if you're told you get A and B, that C and D might have been -- that C and D will not be given?",
  "Very well, Mr. Moran. Mr. Restuccia.",
  "Do they all sit together?",
  "But it's just one court.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Restuccia. Mr. Schaerr, we'll hear from you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Schaerr. Mr. Moran, you have 3 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Moran. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument now in Aurelio Gonzalez v. James Crosby. Mr. Rashkind.",
  "But it's still very vague.",
  "But this is going to be taken up by some 800 district judges and a couple hundred appellate judges, and they're the ones who have the final say in most of these cases just because we decide so few.",
  "Well, we're not talking about ordinary appellate review. We're talking about an appeal from an adverse decision by a Federal habeas court.",
  "So that isn't quite as strange as you make it sound.",
  "Well, but maybe that's what Congress wanted.",
  "But at what point do we bring this all to a halt? I mean, there's always one more argument to make that the last court to rule against me was wrong.",
  "Very well, Mr. Rashkind.",
  "Mr. Kise, we'll hear from you.",
  "What about a claim that a witness perjured himself, a witness for the government, during trial?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Kise. Ms. Millett, we'll hear from you.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Millett. Mr. Rashkind, you have 4 minutes left.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Rashkind. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument now in American Trucking Associations v. Michigan Public Service Commission and a companion case. Mr. Digges.",
  "Wouldn't we be better able to decide this question after a trial rather than speculation on both sides?",
  "Well, Nippert was over 100 years ago, wasn't it?",
  "It seems like 100 years ago.",
  "Very well, Mr. Digges. Mr. Hanson.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Hanson.",
  "Your time is expired.",
  "Mr. Boynton, we'll hear from you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Boynton. Mr. Stewart, we'll hear from you.",
  "Briefly.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Digges, you have 4 minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Digges.",
  "The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument now in Ricky Bell v. Gregory Thompson. Ms. Smith.",
  "Did the court give any explanatory reason for what it did?",
  "But a single judge doesn't have the authority, does he?",
  "Well, how many cases very similar to that -- this exists? It struck me as just procedurally bizarre.",
  "Very well, Ms. Smith. Mr. Shors.",
  "For how long after the judgment becomes final can a court engage in sua sponte consideration of whether to grant a rehearing?",
  "Shouldn't the State at least be notified of the pendency of this sort of thing?",
  "Well, now, that - - that really doesn't add up.",
  "That might be a clerical error all by itself.",
  "But there was no doubt that there was a final judgment here in the death sentence.",
  "This was -- this was how long after cert had been denied?",
  "Well, to say there's no surprise to the State, that may be the State probably knew as much as the defendant about what was in the record, but certainly it was a surprise to the State to know that the court of appeals, after cert was denied, was pondering all this for that long a time.",
  "So the counsel should go to the -- see the docket sheet regularly to see whether the court of appeals might be doing something?",
  "And you say the State should have known what the court of appeals -- before cert was ever considered because it was on a docket sheet. But the case was over, so far as the parties were concerned, in the court of appeals and in the district court.",
  "What if the court of appeals were talking about a point of law and the court of appeals issued an opinion saying we agree with three circuits and disagree with four others? The losing party brings it here and we deny certiorari. It goes back. And then one of the judges on the panel says, gee, I think we should have gone with the other circuits. Can they do that at that point?",
  "But that's an intervening circumstance. It's not a single judge changing his mind.",
  "What was the -- what court had granted the stay?",
  "And it remained in effect all that time?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Shors.",
  "Ms. Smith.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Smith. The case is submitted.",
  "We'll hear argument now in Arthur Andersen v. United States. Ms. Mahoney.",
  "And what is a \"document\"? I mean, in Justice Kennedy's example, is it just some handwritten notes? Do they become \"documents\"?",
  "Very well, Ms. Mahoney. Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you.",
  "But you could undermine and be unsuccessful. It's not as though undermine means that you're necessarily going to succeed.",
  "So that big, heavy guy would violate the statute just by standing there?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Ms. Mahoney, you have four minutes remaining.",
  "Thank you, Ms. Mahoney. The case is submitted. [Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the"
