  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Confrontation Clause prohibited the admission of the accomplice's custodial statement here for two reasons: first, because its interlocking nature did not establish its reliability under this Court's Roberts jurisprudence; and second, and more fundamentally, because the accomplice's custodial statement amounted to out-of- court testimony that was never submitted to cross- examination, in violation of the traditional understanding of the right to confrontation.",
  "What I mean, Mr. Chief Justice, is someone giving a statement out of court that is the functional equivalent of what they would do in court, which is to say they're giving the authorities a statement that is describing an event in a way that they understand is going to be used in a criminal investigation.",
  "Ordinarily that's the -- that would be the dividing line.",
  "Well, because the Confrontation Clause, to go back to the text and to start with the text, talks about being a witness against somebody. And the -- and the common understanding of that term is to give a statement that you understand is going to be used in a criminal investigation, and when you're giving a statement to the authorities, here a custodial statement to the police, that's a different situation than the ordinary, everyday occurrence of speaking to a friend or a colleague or something.",
  "That's the way I read the -- the term witness against in the Constitution. It's the gateway to the Confrontation Clause. Yes, Justice Souter.",
  "The private --",
  "Well, I mean, I -- I think that that's the kind of a statement that ordinarily is not going to be testimonial. You know, an auto accident -- I take it you're -- you're talking about an auto accident in terms of a criminal case. But --",
  "I mean, that's the kind of a situation that there could be a difficult question in something like that, but I think that is likely not to be testimonial.",
  "I think the police officer certainly tips the balance and certainly when somebody is talking to a police officer, that's the kind of a statement they understand is going to be used in court.",
  "Well, I understand, Mr. Chief Justice, there are going to be some close cases out on the margins, and I acknowledge that. But what the testimonial approach does is it covers the core cases, the ones that the Confrontation Clause has always been concerned with. And really, it's not so much a new test. What -- what the testimonial approach does is really sum up what this Court itself did in interpreting the common law and bringing that under the umbrella of the Sixth Amendment starting in Kirby and Mattox, the Court's earliest decisions on the Confrontation Clause, really all the way up through Douglas in the 1960's where actually in that very opinion the Court uses the term to describe a custodial confession -- the Court uses the term the equivalent of testimony. And so that's the kind of a situation we're talking about to --",
  "Well, the --",
  "I don't think, Your Honor, any cases since Roberts.",
  "Nor any case before Roberts.",
  "Because the lower courts aren't getting it right, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and I think that the problem is, is that the Roberts approach sets up a framework that is both unworkable in practice and is leading to consistently anomalous results. And I think it's --",
  "That's how I understand the facts of the case, Justice Kennedy. The victim was -- was in police custody at the time of the examination, and it was in coordination with the police. So, yes, Idaho v. Wright, as well as all this Court's other cases, would come out. But it's important, you know, to go back to the question and say, you know, why change from Roberts if we've gotten to the right places in -- in our cases. And the answer is, you know, certainly this Court may never have to change from Roberts, but simply understanding the way that Roberts is working in the lower courts I believe should cause this -- cause the Court great concern. The --",
  "That's correct, Justice O'Connor, but, you know, I would submit that you're going to have to practically fill your docket with Confrontation Clause cases doing error correction in order to come out correct in all these cases.",
  "Well, that's right. And that's -- and -- and what's happened, because you haven't done that, is the lower courts are reaching some very, very bad results. I was responding to Justice O'Connor's question about why change from Roberts if we're getting to the right solution, and the reason is because the way that the test is framed, it just simply is unworkable in the lower courts. As we cited in our brief, there are -- we gathered 20 factors that lower courts are using for indicia of reliability. We could have listed 40 or 50. The United States is asking you, as well as the State, to stick with this -- stick with this reliability approach for all of its faults. And you know, the -- the ironic thing with that kind of a -- of -- of a position is the more testimonial the statement is, the more reliable it is, and in turn --",
  "Well, first of all, Justice Breyer, you don't have to get too far into that in this case because, of course --",
  "I think --",
  "I think I agree with the starting point of the functional equivalent of testimony. And then I think that the law professors' test, the reasonable expectation, is a good test, and I would -- I would embellish that by saying that I think that what we have is 99 cases out of 100 that's going to be the situation that I -- I believe the Chief Justice brought up, which is the -- somebody speaking to the authorities in the course of the investigation of a crime, somebody giving a statement to the authorities or directing one to them.",
  "I think there may be, and the reason -- I think there may be a -- a rare, rare case, Justice Ginsburg, in a scenario -- you know, come up with hypotheticals. One possible scenario might be somebody giving a statement to their friend and directing them to tell the police. So, you know, simply using an intermediary where we know the statement is going to the police, but --",
  "Well, in that --",
  "Well, I mean, I think that's a situation -- you know, and this is where the definitional problem gets difficult. I mean, because the other part of the Confrontation Clause is a limitation on State power, and it says -- you know, going all the way Blackstone, it's a limitation on the State molding statements that it's going to use later in a criminal investigation. So if that kind of a situation were present where somebody is molding somebody's statement, I think that might be something the Confrontation Clause is concerned with as well. And that goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question to say that, yes, there may be, you know, difficult cases -- difficult hypothetical out in the margin, but what we have here is a test that covers what are the time-and-again cases that are coming before this Court and coming before the lower courts.",
  "Well, certainly I -- I -- you know, you don't have to decide that question in this case, but I think that if either one of them --",
  "I see, Your Honor. I think that proper -- the proper test would be if -- if one of the two people is so -- you know, is doing something with the purpose of understanding it's going to be used in a criminal case, then we have a testimonial situation. I think you -- this Court could say that, but it -- you have to look back --",
  "I think certainly the speaker and I think there may be situations -- and this is -- this is something the Court can deal with about when this -- about when the -- when the governmental officer is the only one and -- and is under such a circumstance that the governmental officer is molding the statement in such a way and molding what somebody is going to say --",
  "Well, the first reason is because, as I said, if you have difficult cases out on the margin, I submit to the Court the Constitution could tolerate that.",
  "No, I'm sorry, Mr. -- Justice Breyer. I may have misunderstood partially the suggestion -- the hypothetical that I was getting. I think you're correct that the traditional kind of co-conspirator statements under that kind of a situation would come in under either approach. What I understood the hypothetical to be was a situation where somebody, after a conspiracy is done, is doing --",
  "I think that's the ordinary course of events. Yes, Justice Ginsburg.",
  "Well, if there's an undercover officer present, it meets -- it meets the -- the -- you know, the test of a statement made to the police. But then I think this is where the law professors have it right, and this is where I'm agreeing with Justice Breyer.",
  "I think that's correct.",
  "I think that's the traditional kind of co-conspirator statement that is not covered by the testimonial approach. And -- and I think --",
  "Without difficulty as to the Confrontation Clause, yes, Justice O'Connor. And I think it's important when we look at these hypotheticals to compare what we have on the other side when you look at the Roberts approach. Under the Roberts approach, no matter how much -- you know, if somebody gives an out-of-court affidavit, if somebody speaks ex parte to a grand jury, even if a witness takes the stand in the middle of a criminal trial -- in -- in a criminal trial and puts blame directly on the defendant, and then, for example, were to die or suddenly go missing, under Roberts you have the situation where the trial judge doesn't strike the testimony, doesn't disallow it, but looks to its reliability. And the odd thing -- and this is what I was getting to earlier. Compared to what the State and the Solicitor General are proposing to you today, the odd thing is the more testimonial it is, the more it comes under the core concern of the Confrontation Clause that started in Raleigh's trial and has moved all the way forward -- the more testimonial it is, the more likely it's pass -- it is to pass the Roberts test.",
  "I think the answer is absolutely not, Justice O'Connor. Under this Court's Wright opinion -- you know, the rationale for the lower court was interlocking confessions. Under this Court's Roberts -- I'm sorry. Under this Court's opinion in Wright, it is only the inherent indicia of reliability surrounding a statement not other evidence at trial that a judge can look to. So --",
  "It doesn't matter in this case, Justice O'Connor, for two reasons. First of all, because under Wright, you cannot look to the defendant's confession in order to assess the reliability of Sylvia's statement, and that's what the Washington Supreme Court did. The second reason is even if you could look to that -- to the substantive evidence at trial, several other indicia showed that the statement here was unreliable. The -- the witness was drunk. She said she'd been in shock during the events. She gave two inconsistent statements within a 4-hour span. She was in police custody after being told that it depended what she told the officers as to whether or not she'd be allow to leave. So there are several, several reasons to believe that the statement here --",
  "-- you know, is excludable under both tests.",
  "Well, under the testimonial approach, Mr. Chief Justice?",
  "For the simple reason that she was in custody giving a statement, giving a confession or a -- or a custodial examination to police officers knowing it was going to be used in the criminal investigation. That's the traditional -- it is -- is the most common -- it is the core concern of the Confrontation Clause.",
  "It brings us all the way back to Raleigh's trial.",
  "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. Mancusi comes out exactly the same way, and here's why. And this shows why my test -- why the testimonial approach is actually quite narrow. All the testimonial approach says is the witness has to have had a chance to cross-examine the witness.",
  "If, when it comes time for trial -- I'm sorry?",
  "I'm sorry. The defendant has to have had a chance to cross-examine the witness. If trial rolls around and the witness is unavailable, through no fault of the parties, and there's been adequate cross- examination, as in Mancusi and actually as in Roberts itself -- and -- and I actually --",
  "Right. The statement needs to be given in the defendant's presence with the defendant himself having the opportunity to cross-examine.",
  "No, I don't believe it does.",
  "You would have to show that a particular declarant is unavailable --",
  "-- if it were a testimonial statement. What -- what --",
  "Well, that's the kind of a thing that's traditional hearsay. It's outside of the scope of the phrase witness against. It's outside of the scope of the testimonial approach.",
  "An excited utterance comes out the same way under --",
  "Right. It's just purely a hearsay question, Justice -- Chief Justice Rehnquist.",
  "That's exactly right. I'm sorry, Justice --",
  "It's -- it's close, Justice Ginsburg. Washington law renders as a default rule that a spouse is unavailable to testify against another spouse. Mr. Crawford here declined to waive that privilege.",
  "Well, I mean, I think you're asking me as a Federal issue. As -- you know, as a State law issue, Washington State law has decided that the second -- that the out-of-court statement can come in. As a Federal --",
  "As a -- well, the reason -- you don't understand the logic of the State law rule?",
  "I agree, Justice Ginsburg. It is -- it is a somewhat odd State law rule. There's a -- there's a case called State v. Burden that the Washington Supreme Court held that the marital privilege applies just to the -- just to actually facing your spouse on the stand in the course of a trial because it -- you know, it helps your spouse avoid the possibility of perjury and things like that. And it said it doesn't apply to out-of-court statements. I think you could make a very strong argument that it ought to apply to both, but as a State law matter, the Washington Supreme Court has said only in-court testimony. Unless the Court has any further questions, I'll reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor. I think it's important to concentrate in rebuttal on the State's suggestion and the Solicitor General's suggestion to retain the reliability prong of the Roberts framework. The Solicitor General agrees with us that the history of the -- that -- that you ought to be looking to history here, and the history on this point is crystal clear. From Rex v. -- Rex v. Paine in 1696, other English cases before the Constitution, and then this Court's cases after the Constitution was adopted, principally Kirby and Mattox, and all the way through Douglas, the -- when the situation arose that a witness was unavailable, the rule was clear if the -- if -- if the statement was testimonial, given to the authorities, it had to be excluded. And it's not -- and the -- and the balance was struck by the Framers not -- not just because of these public policy considerations, but because of the Framers were insisting upon an adversarial method of giving testimony. And when the Framers decided, when that was not present, that we were simply not prepared to -- to admit the testimony. And so what we have is we have a clear rule until at least the 1970's that reliability doesn't matter. And the only time reliability -- first was adopted by this Court. The only time it became important was in Dutton v. Evans when you had a non-testimonial statement, and then in Roberts when this Court created a general framework that it allowed reliability, all of a sudden, be into play when we were stretching the Confrontation Clause in our view too far. But once you bring the Confrontation Clause back to the proper scope, as we're asking you to do and the Solicitor General is asking you to do, there's really no reason anymore to -- to keep the reliability prong. The reliability prong was -- was adopted by this Court to deal with the problem of hearsay that was coming outside the testimonial type setting. Once you -- once you read it -- read that problem away, we're back to the original understanding of the Confrontation Clause. And the reason that you ought to stick with that -- Justice Ginsburg I think put the nail on the head when she said the reason we're here today is that you have a -- you -- you have -- what you have now is a system where trial judges can reach almost any conclusion they want. That's shown in our briefs. The Solicitor General doesn't even describe to you how reliability -- doesn't even defend reliability findings in light of all the briefing by -- by the petitioner and by amici. And so I think that when you look at that, you show that the very concern that gave rise to Raleigh trial -- and I would say parenthetically that I believe Lord Cobham was unavailable in the trial. That's what the transcript says. And the very problem was that trial judges could do these reliability determinations in place of -- of a clear rule of when testimony could be given. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The sentencing system at issue here contains exactly the same infirmities that the system -- that this de-validated two years ago, in Ring versus Arizona. Once a defendant's convicted of a felony, Washington law sets a statutory cap to that a sentencing Judge may not exceed unless there are facts present that are not accounted for in the guilty verdict. These are called aggravating facts. Yet in Washington, just like Arizona, a Judge makes these findings. And in Washington, it's even worse than Arizona in that the standard of proof is a preponderance of the evidence, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the statutory maximum as Apprendi defines that term, as Apprendi and Ring define that term, is the highest sentence that is allowable based on the facts and the guilty verdict. That -- that sentence in this case, is the top end of the standard range, it would be 53 months for Mr. Blakely. You're correct that Washington law labels an additional cap as what Washington law calls the statutory maximum which is the ultimate exceptional sentence, or the ultimate enhancement that could be put forward. But that is simply a second cap. The question that this Court in Apprendi and Ring asked was what is the maximum sentence to which the defendant can be subjected to, based on the facts in the guilty verdict. And that is the top of the standard range.",
  "I don't think so, Justice O'Connor.",
  "Well, the big difference, the biggest difference between the Federal system and Washington, is the Federal system is a system of court rules. Not a system of Legislative mandates. So when Apprendi and Ring use the term the highest penalty authorized by the legislature, or the statutory maximum that is easily applied to this case, because all of the",
  "That can sometimes be the case. Because the sentencing system that is at issue here, is fully legislated. However, when it",
  "Well, that may well be the case, Justice O'Connor, I don't think you have to decide the Federal -- that issue in this case. But this Court's clearly held Williams and lots of other cases that if a legislature leaves it up to individual judges to decide what kinds of facts they want to consider in meting out sentences that is fully constitutional. And as this Court described the Federal guideline scheme is Mistretta, this Court in pages 395 and 396 of that opinion said what we really have is just an aggregation of that same individualized discretion. Just make it a little bit more formal in the Federal scheme.",
  "Absolutely. That was the crux of the holding, Justice Scalia. I realize there was some disagreement on that issue. However, Justice O'Connor, to get back to your question, the critical distinction is, if the legislature is content to leave it up to judges, or the judicial branch to decide what factors matter and where lines should be drawn, then Apprendi is not triggered in the same way that it is when a legislature steps in and says -- as it has done in this case. We are not prepared to allow a court to go above a certain threshold unless it finds additional facts. Unless additional facts are present.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there are two parts of Apprendi, one is -- footnote 16 of Apprendi, this Court talked about the democratic constraints that operate on legislatures vis-a-vis courts. And when a legislature steps in and says we're not prepared to let a sentence go above a certain level unless certain facts are present, that's a very different system, than when a legislature steps in and says we will let courts operate however they like underneath a certain -- underneath a certain system.",
  "Yes, Justice O'Connor, I believe that that's what the holding in Apprendi and Ring would dictate.",
  "Well, I think that is what's happening in this case, Justice Souter. And what happens is, and it takes us back to Apprendi",
  "Well, from the defendant's point of view you might say that it is, but there is a difference in that Apprendi talks -- the baseline of Apprendi is deciding what are elements. And elements -- the wellspring of elements and the definition of a crime has to flow from a legislative function, a legislature or the person who makes the laws sets out what facts matter, or what facts don't matter. So it's absolutely the case of course that Winship and the Sixth Amendment apply to courts just as much as they apply to legislatures, however we need a baseline for where those rights kick in, and I think that the proper baseline, or a proper baseline would be the facts that the legislative body or the lawmaker has set out that matter for punishment.",
  "I think the Sixth Amendment is constitutional, Justice",
  "The difference is, in the Washington scheme the legislature has in effect -- the legislature has caught it by the sentencing grid. The legislature has enacted itself, all of the standard sentencing ranges. Whereas in the Federal scheme, the legislature, or the Congress has left it up to courts to decide where the standard sentencing ranges ought to fall, so long as they're under an open",
  "I'm not sure I",
  "The reason it makes a difference is because in the Washington system, in the state system the legislature has, as a policy choice with democratic constraints operating upon it, selected a maximum that it's not prepared to let judges go above. So it's constraining the discretion of judges. In the Federal system, Congress is -- you're right, Congress is telling judges, we want you to come up with rules and follow them. But it's leaving it up to the judges, the judicial branch, to come up with what the rules are. So the only significant difference that comes out of the briefing, between this case and the Ring Case, is that -- is the state points to the fact that unlike Ring, where you had 10 aggravating factors, here Washington sets out a general standard, and leaves -- and says 11 -- 11 suggested aggravators, but it calls those aggravators illustrative rather than exclusive. However, we believe that under a proper application of Apprendi that distinction makes no difference.",
  "It's not, Mr. Chief Justice. You are correct but if they did leave it completely up to the judge that would be the Williams case, it would be a very different case than this one. However, the way that the Washington law is written, and the way it's been interpreted by the Washington courts is that the eleven factors are illustrative, and so therefore if a court is going to depart on a factor that is not one of them on the list, it has to be analogous, or fairly closely tied into the factors that are on the list. So in the Ammons case for example which is one of the first Washington State Supreme Court cases interpreting their guideline system. They said very bluntly that the whole purpose of this system was to take away the unfettered discretion that we had in the past and to significantly constrain it.",
  "Well, in a typical system, Justice Kennedy, there are one, two, maybe three aggra proposed aggravating factors. So what we'd be proposing is that yes, during the trial the prosecutor would charge an aggravated crime, and simply -- just like the deadly weapon in this case, they would have charged deliberate cruelty. And the judge would instruct the jury on what deliberate cruelty means.",
  "So long as the guilty plea does not include any stipulation to an aggravating fact, yes, the top would be the standard range. However",
  "Well, I'm not sure it would work exactly that way, Justice O'Connor. I think what would work would be that the defendant in this case",
  "I'm sorry. Justice Ginsburg, is that in this case for example the defendant would have pled guilty. And he could have said I agree that I committed deliberate cruelty in this case, which would raise the cap and the judge would be able to do a sentence anywhere under that cap.",
  "Absolutely, Justice Souter.",
  "Well, the way it works right now in Washington, is that if the defendant enters a plea, there's a presentence report that goes to the judge. The judge can also, as the judge should in this case, have the victim testify for example. However, Washington law specifically provides that if the judge wants to impose an exceptional sentence, based on aggravating facts, and the defendant disputes the presence of those facts, Washington law already provides in Section 370, the Judge has to hold a hearing. And that's exactly what the judge -- I'm sorry.",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, certainly my case doesn't stand or fall on the fact that the judge is the one that did this hearing. However, I think that in that circumstance it seems a sensible result that if the prosecutor isn't asking for an aggravated factor and nobody's contesting it, then the judge ought to either be bound by the deal, or the judge in the interest of justice, as he always has, can say I don't think this is a fair plea.",
  "Yeah.",
  "I think it varies, Justice Scalia.",
  "That's right, Justice Scalia.",
  "Well, I think that you're right that Apprendi works in plea bargaining, but with all due respect I'm not sure that I accept that doesn't work in",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, the same thing happens for example when there's a lesser included offense in the case.",
  "Well, as I said, the typical situation in Washington is more like two or three aggravators. I understand the Federal system is more complicated, but in the state system, there's typically two or three aggravators and in fact Washington itself proves that this works. Because Washington has already singled out several factors they call sentence enhancements. Such as using a deadly weapon, selling drugs within a 1000 feet of a school zone and some other ones on the list that they already require to be treated exactly in this fashion. And then things -- and I've never seen anyone complain, and with certain",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, one other point is important here because, in many cases it's not going to be such a big problem. However, in the one state that we've seen that has adopted this system essentially the fix that we think would be the proper fix here in the State of Kansas, they've said that if a defendant contests aggravating factors that not -- they have to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the statute also provides that in the interest of justice the judge can sever the guilt phase and the sentencing phase, and so if -- it puts the defendant.....",
  "That's correct.",
  "Well, I think that's generally the case, and that's why I said it's just like what might happen for example in a lesser included case, when murder and manslaughter was charged and it was the defendant's position that it wasn't him. He wasn't around.",
  "Right. Well as I said, there are",
  "Right.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, I think the Constitution doesn't prevent Congress or any legislature at all from regularizing criminal sentencing.",
  "Sentencing guideline systems are fine, and Apprendi says nothing about whether legislatures can come in, and regiment out and separate all the factors. The only thing Apprendi says, is that if a sentence is conditioned on a certain finding of fact, and there is a dispute about that finding of fact, the defendant should have the right to have the jury make that finding beyond a reasonable doubt rather than have to judge.",
  "Well",
  "Well, assuming the Federal system -- if you're assuming the Federal system was covered by Apprendi. I think that",
  "Well, to whatever extent a grand jury needs to charge aggravated crimes I think they would need to charge it and then apply",
  "Yeah. Apprendi says that under fair notice principles -- I'm going to stumble here a little bit.",
  "I'm stumbling over the grand jury because this is a state case, and not a Federal one.",
  "Right.",
  "Right. But to the extent the grand jury requirement applied it would -- the grand jury would need to charge the aggravator just like anything else. And as Justice Scalia",
  "Well, it can, but I think it's important to look at the injustice in this case, Justice Kennedy. He made a deal to get kidnaping II, and didn't plead to any aggravators, however he got a sentence that was more in line with kidnaping I, based on facts that he never acknowledged and he disputed.",
  "By my study, Justice O'Connor, I don't think that is correct.",
  "Well, there are only about 17 states that have guideline systems right now. By my count, only about 10 of them have a system like the State of Washington's. The other seven have systems where they do create standard sentencing ranges, but then they leave it up to the judge to depart from those ranges whenever they want to based on any reason. Those systems I think are just fine no matter what this Court says today. So I think we're only talking about those 10 systems like the State of Washington's.",
  "That's right, Justice Scalia, and obviously this Court has thought a lot about that issue already in the prior Apprendi case, as to what -- what the effects of its rulings are going to be.",
  "I'll try.",
  "What is undemocratic -- leaving it up to judges? Yes, but that's the whole point of Apprendi is that the democratic constraints operate on a legislature, and then when a legislature steps in, that different things apply. And when the legislature says something, as footnote 16 in Apprendi mentioned, it's a different force than when leaving it up to the judges. If it's all right with the Court, I'll reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I think it's important to make two points about Washington law, lest the Court be left with any confusion. The first is, the Washington legislature has most definitely not left it up to Washington judges to depart upward for any reason they want. They have not left it entirely up to the judges' discretion. A judge has to find, as the judge in this case did, one of the eleven listed factors or one that is analogous to those eleven factors. And there are case after case in Washington, or appellate decisions saying this aggravating fact is not good enough. But if the Gore decision, and the Cardenas decision both cited in my briefs. Another example is Barnes -- the Barnes decision at 818 P.2d 1088 in which for example the Washington Supreme Court said future dangerous which is a common aggravating factor in other contexts, it's not a valid aggravating factor in Washington in most kinds of crimes because the legislature did not list that out. And in fact what the Washington Supreme Court said there, is they said, if we were to find that we would be giving ourselves too much discretion back for the very point of the Sentencing Reform Act was to take discretion away from us, to go above the standard sentencing range. The second point about Washington law is, Mr. Knodell is right, that there is some discretion built into the system, but that discretion kicks in only after the judge has made the required factual finding. In that respect the system is just like the one in Ring where the aggravating fact is necessary but not sufficient for the ultimate sentence. The Judge still can in his discretion - this, Justice Breyer, goes to your question, the judge still once the jury or the proper fact finder makes all the required factual findings, the judge can still consider all the facts in the case, and go anywhere below that new maximum that's been established. So judicial discretion is still retained in Kansas' system and it would be retained in Washington's system. And the final thing I'd like to say is that Mr. Dreeben's point that this case is different than Ring because the fact that they're illustrative rather than exclusive would lead to Apprendi simply being a mere formality because all the legislature would have to do, for example in the Ring case, is have factor number 11 that says anything similar to the others on this list. Then you'd have people saying, well, judges can do just about what they were doing, which was finding one of those 10 factors, but because there's factor 11, that says something similar to this is also good enough that Apprendi somehow doesn't apply. We submit that a straightforward application of Apprendi as it was stated in Ring, requires a reversal in this case. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Michelle McCottry's statements here were testimonial for the simple reason that she knowingly told a governmental agent associated with law enforcement that someone had committed a crime. Prosecutions based on such ex parte statements in place of live testimony strike at the very heart of the evil the Confrontation Clause is designed to prevent: trials on the basis of out-of-court accusations. Indeed, the trial here really can't be described as anything other than inquisitorial in nature. The sole proof that Mr. Davis was at Ms. McCottry's house and assaulted her that day was the 4 - minute, tape-recorded 911 police incident interview that the State played at Mr. Davis' trial and that it itself described as Ms. McCottry's testimony on the day this happened.",
  "It --",
  "It doesn't -- it doesn't answer one way or another whether it's testimonial. What it does and what I'm trying to do for this Court is, first, draw back the lens for a moment and look at the kind of trial that we end up with when statements of the -- like fresh accusations in this case, are able to be used in place of live testimony.",
  "Let -- let me address that question in two parts. The first part you've mentioned, Justice Ginsburg, is whether it matters that the -- that the operator is not a police officer, and we submit no.",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "I see. Well, we don't believe, under the proper conception of the Confrontation Clause, it matters who the accusatory statement is initiated by. Certainly we believe the Confrontation Clause should apply if Ms. McCottry had simply walked out of her house and walked down the street to the police station and voluntarily walked into the sheriff's office and said, I want to report what Mr. Davis just did. What we -- what we suggest here today is there's no difference if she simply calls on the telephone to a 911 operator, which the State itself in its brief calls a conduit to the police, and so when the -- when the police and when the State have set up a system for people to report calls more expeditiously -- I'm sorry -- report crimes more expeditiously, we don't think the answer is any different.",
  "Well, there -- in -- in a sense, of course, Ms. McCottry is seeking help at the same time she's reporting a crime, but the -- the mere fact that the two are intertwined does not take us outside the Confrontation Clause. Of course, in the Indiana case that you're going to hear, you're going to hear the same thing, that the person is asking for help in the same way. So when somebody makes a call, which we might call a mixed motive or a dual purpose call, the question that we think this Court should ask is whether -- whether that's the kind of a statement, first of all, that historically would have been viewed as implicating the Confrontation Clause. And if you look at the hue -- the old hue and cry practice that we've referred to in our briefs, Sir Matthew Hale in his treatise explains that when somebody went and got the local constable, what they were doing is they were seeking help, first and foremost, to apprehend a felon, and more than that, they were also reporting the crime in the first instance.",
  "Well, you certainly don't have to go that far in this case, Your Honor, but -- but we believe --",
  "Certainly any statement describing criminal activity to a law enforcement officer would be testimonial.",
  "The purpose of the hearsay rule, Justice Breyer, is to police the reliability of out-of - court statements. What this Court said in Crawford is the Confrontation Clause is something much different. It regulates the manner of taking testimony in criminal trials.",
  "Well, we believe the rule is, is that any accusatory statement to a law enforcement officer or to an agent of the law -- of law enforcement --",
  "Well, the --",
  "-- the history of the confrontation right, going back even prior to the framer, was to bring the accuser and the accused face to face so that the accuser made his or her accusation in the presence of the accused and subject to cross examination. And the very heart of the Confrontation Clause, which this Court has said itself over and over again is to require the accuser to -- to deliver the accusation in court, and so accusatory statements, those that say he did it, this is what happened, this is what I saw, are different than ordinary hearsay. And -- and I -- to take an example from -- that we talked about in the Crawford argument, Justice Breyer, when somebody says pass the -- pass the pewter urn from the mantle, that's where Bob keeps the drugs, that's the kind of a statement that is very different than pointing the finger at somebody to a law enforcement agent.",
  "Absolutely, Justice Scalia, I --",
  "It does, and what I'm giving you is a -- a rule that I think is the kernel, the heart of the confrontation right. You don't have to say much more than that if it's --",
  "I think statements that law enforcement officer merely overhear may not be testimonial, and one of the reasons for that is this Court's Bourjaily decision, which it cited with approval in Crawford, is if somebody make -- if somebody makes statements that tend out -- that turn out to be incriminating in a criminal case, the mere fact that they're overheard by law enforcement officers or even an undercover officer eliciting the statement is in a different scenario, Mr. Chief Justice, than somebody making a statement to law enforcement or even -- and I want to make sure I understand your hypothetical. If the person realized that a police officer was standing there and hearing what she was telling her neighbor, we may then have a testimonial situation. But in this case what we have is not simply a blurting out or a cry for help. In fact, Ms. McCottry never asked for help. She said she didn't need an aid car. What we have are a series of 26 questions that the 911 operator asked Ms. McCottry that established every element of the crime the court -- I'm sorry -- that the State ultimately proved.",
  "Well --",
  "I think that's a fair inference, Justice Scalia. Of course, we don't know because she was never -- she's never herself submitted to cross examination. But there are mandatory arrest laws in the State of Washington. She had a no-contact order against Mr. Davis, both of which a reasonable person would understand that a call for 911 would be tantamount to a call for arrest.",
  "It's about 4 minutes, Justice Ginsburg. And it's not -- what we submit is -- of course, we've given you in the joint appendix the structured protocol that the 911 operator was following in this case, and we submit that it's not mere happenstance that the 911 call was able to establish every element of the crime, right down to Mr. Davis' birth date that the prosecutor referred to in her closing argument that the 911 operator elicited from Ms. McCottry. And, indeed, the only question --",
  "It may be, and that may be another example, Mr. Chief Justice, of a -- of a --",
  "I don't want to dispute that 911 operators in this situation, just like responding officers, are gathering information for dual purposes. They may well be trying to resolve an ongoing threat of a felon at large. At the same time, of course, all of the information and training manuals that we've provided to you in the reply brief make it clear that from the initial contact with the alleged victim, they are gathering evidence all the while. And in fact, the only thing you can think of -- at least, I can't think of a single question that a prosecutor might have asked at a trial that the 911 operator didn't ask here. The only questions that really immediately come to mind are ones that might have been asked in cross examination. For example --",
  "To the extent that the person is saying someone is attacking me, that kernel may -- may well be testimonial, Justice Alito. However, if somebody calls 911 and says, please send help to 911 Main -- or 3312 Main Street, that may well not be testimonial. And that -- a mere cry for help -- and this goes to Justice Ginsburg's question as well. A simple cry for help may -- may not be testimonial.",
  "I think that's a fair inference, but the -- the priority attention, in terms of going and apprehending Mr. Davis, is exactly what triggers criminal justice system and exactly what makes the kind of a statement, the one that the -- one that the Confrontation Clause should care about.",
  "I'm not sure it's easy to separate one from the other, Mr. Chief Justice. The way that they are doing that is by arresting him. They have a mandatory arrest law in Washington that says that the way that the police must respond to a call like this is to arrest --",
  "No, Justice Stevens. It's our view that you really ought not be looking or focusing on the police officer motive or on the governmental agent's motive for the very reason that you start to get into these knotty questions of what exactly were they trying to accomplish. And we believe a better -- a better default than -- if you can't simply answer it by looking at history and precedent, is to look more towards the declarant's reasonable expectation. And that's what this Court does in the Fifth Amendment when it --",
  "The latter --",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "The latter is a very close case, Justice Souter. I think you're right insofar as it -- it can be important to distinguish between a modern-day excited utterance and what would have been considered a res gestae type statement at common law. Certainly if you take away the 911 call from your hypothetical and she says, please don't hurt me, Adrian, that may well be the kind of a statement that would be inside the res gestae. Once somebody picks up the phone to call 911, that, by my reading of the historical cases, turns it into a report or a narrative.",
  "We believe that as long as it is making a report to a third party, there ought not be a distinction. Now, of course, you don't have to wrestle with that in this case because --",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, of course, we didn't have telephone technology, so --",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, for two reasons, Justice Scalia. One is we do have the hue and cry scenario that we've talked about.",
  "And we think the fair --",
  "It's not exactly on all fours with this case, but we think the fair inference, when you read the treatises and the reasons why those kinds of statements were kept out, is that if they simply -- if the police or their agents were able to get the statement just a little bit sooner, the answer would have been the same. And we do have cases, Justice Scalia, where people made fresh accusations or cry-outs to private parties to -- to another -- to a witness who wasn't even associated with law enforcement, and we have a whole section of our brief pointing out that for decades after the founding, even those kinds of statements were kept out of evidence in criminal trials for the reason --",
  "Well, I -- I think it's a fair inference, Justice Scalia, from reading the historical precedent and the treatises that describe it. They -- they describe these as, in -- in a sense, second-class testimony. They say the problem with statements like this, if they're made even seconds after the event in place, is that they're -- at that point they're nothing more than a narrative and require us to give credit to a statement -- and this is the words the treatise writers used to use -- that was not given under the ordinary tests for determining the accuracy of testimony. And when they used the word like testimony and they talk about the usual tests and the customary way of testing out-of-court statements, I think the fair inference is they're referring to the right to confrontation. Perhaps another way to think about this is to take a step back and say, what if we decide that statements like this are not testimonial? The practical -- the practical impact of that is not simply that these statements won't -- will come in, but that prosecutors and -- prosecutors, Federal and State government, will have no incentive whatsoever to ever bring 911 callers into court. It -- it is -- across State hearsay law across the country, these are deemed excited utterances. So if this Court were to say --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I think you got to the heart of the matter when you said that if it's a good witness, the prosecutor will put them on. The flip side of that is that if the witness isn't so good, the prosecutor would have every incentive at least not to put them on the stand. Why would somebody put on a stand -- put somebody on a stand that doesn't seem perhaps credible or maybe subject to impeachment when they have, in a sense, testimony in a sealed tape recorder already?",
  "Well, the defendant --",
  "The defendant might be able to do that. But, of course, that would -- treating the case this way would collapse the confrontation right into the Compulsory Process Clause. The confrontation right is a right not to be able to bring witnesses into court. It's to be confronted with the witnesses against --",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think your assumption may not be entirely correct. There's a -- there's a portion from, for example, the San Diego prosecutor's office decided, and I believe in the NACDL brief, that says oftentimes they do prefer to -- to leave the witness off the stand because they have a better case just using the -- the excited utterance type statements.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's right. That's right. And perhaps -- and this gets back to the Chief Justice's question as well. It helps maybe to separate these kinds of cases into three categories. We first have the category that the prosecution would prefer not to put the person on the stand. We think there the Confrontation Clause ought to require them to do so. We -- we next have the category where the defendant, as you say, procures the witness' absence. We don't dispute that in that scenario the forfeiture doctrine kicks in, which this Court reaffirmed in Crawford. We don't have any forfeiture question in this case. And then we have perhaps the gray area, where a witness goes missing through no fault of anybody's, and this Court has said over and over again that there the confrontation right puts the onus onto the prosecution.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I don't want to be insensitive to -- to witnesses in this situation. Of course, reluctant witnesses is nothing new, but -- but in domestic violence, it's an acute problem. However, we believe the proper way to deal with that situation is by this Court developing its forfeiture doctrine. The Sixth Amendment applies across the board to all criminal cases, Justice Ginsburg, and we've cited, for example, in the appendix to our reply brief about 30 cases from the last couple years that have been handled in a victimless fashion like this that are not domestic violence cases --",
  "Pardon me?",
  "Well, that's already what happens under the Federal Rules of Evidence and under the evidence of many States, that there is a rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing. And so --",
  "I'm not --",
  "Well, I think --",
  "Well, I think we have -- Justice Breyer, like in lots of other scenarios, you have a pretrial hearing, and at that pretrial hearing, of course, the rules of evidence don't strictly apply the way they would in the guilt phase. So in this very case, if you look at the joint appendix, when -- when on the eve of trial Ms. McCottry is no longer going to show up for trial, the prosecutor says, I want to subpoena the jail records and I want to talk to the victim's advocate to find out whether she's been intimidated or kept away. So the prosecutor herself tells the court how she's going to look for this evidence. If she had found anything, presumably she would have presented it and she could have presented it that way. And it's --",
  "Well, of course, Justice Scalia, the Sixth Amendment says all criminal prosecutions --",
  "-- and domestic violence cases are criminal prosecutions. So we don't think --",
  "That's right, but we've --",
  "Yes.",
  "I think that's a fair comment. And let -- let me say there are two -- there are many ways that you can do that, Justice Scalia, and two of them were readily available to the State in this case. One is even when a witness goes missing or is unwilling to testify in a hard case, there may well be other ways to prove the case. Here, the caller said --",
  "Pardon me?",
  "That's right, Justice Breyer, but --",
  "Let me give you two ways this case, if -- if we assume the State's version of events is correct, could have easily been proved. One is that the caller said that a man named Mike was at her house during the entire event. When the police showed up at her house some 5 minutes later, they never even got Mike's last name. And, of course, Justice Breyer, the reason why is because they were probably thinking of the Roberts framework and that they wouldn't need this witness, but good old-fashioned police work would have presumably found a witness that witnessed the whole event that they could have put on the stand. The second thing the State could have done in this case is they could have filed the case in a way that they obtained a preliminary hearing. If what the State says is correct that Ms. McCottry was cooperating up until the last minute, that's a classic scenario where, by way of having a preliminary hearing and subjecting her to cross examination at the preliminary hearing, they could have preserved her testimony. This Court in California against Green and Roberts itself said that those kinds of prior pretrial cross examination scenarios are good enough to satisfy the Confrontation Clause. And if the Court has no further questions, I'll reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Thank you. Let me say a word about the record and then two things about the emergency exception that we've been talking about. First, in the record it's always been accepted in this case that Mr. Davis had left the house when the 911 call started. In the joint appendix, page 117, that's what the Washington Supreme Court said, and at page 30 of the evidentiary hearing in the trial court, the prosecutor submitted the case that way as well. Now let me address the history here because it's important. And Justice Scalia is exactly right. There's not a single case historically where a statement to a law enforcement agent accusing someone of a crime was admitted in a criminal case. We're not aware of one.",
  "It -- it is what it is, Justice Breyer. The -- the oldest case that is in the briefs on the other side is White v. Illinois in 1992. So for some 500 years before that. And -- and perhaps when we have to draw an inference, we do have -- to a certain degree we acknowledge the dog that doesn't bark. We have evidence that was out there and simply wasn't used. Let's look at the history of the Marian statutes. And I'm -- and I want to refer the Court specifically to page 101 of Sir Matthew Hale's treatise. He talks about the -- both the problem with the hue and cry and then the reason we have the Marian statutes. The reason we have the Marian statutes was because for pretrial bail and committal hearings, the courts were not prepared to simply go on the initial reports. They wanted a formal examination of the witness to use at even the pretrial hearing, to detain the person pending trial. And Sir Matthew Hale at page 101 says the problem with the fresh reports the hue and cry, is that -- is that they're not under oath. They don't -- they don't even answer all the questions that we would want answered. So what the United States is asking you to accept is that the kind of evidence that the Framers would not have even been prepared to allow at a pretrial bail hearing -- rather, they wanted to have something more formal -- they would now accept to be used in the trial itself. And what we think is that this turns everything on its head. The reason the Marian statutes were abused is because, of course, in continental Europe that was an accepted form of evidence, and so there was some reason to believe these formal statements could be used. No one ever suggested the hue and cry could be used. Finally, let me say a word about police incentives. If you accept the rule that the -- that the United States and -- and the State is asking you to accept, think about the incentives you put on 911 operators. They're not supposed to ask too many questions. They're not supposed to get too much information. The same would go for the responding officer. They don't want to ask too many questions, structured questions, make sure who did it, make sure they have the details because then somehow these statements become testimonial. What our rule says is it frees the 911 operators, it frees the police officers to do what they're supposed to do, which is immediately start responding and both help people and start gathering evidence from the moment that a crime is reported. And that's what we think the Confrontation Clause is all about. It's not -- it's about the way the case is proved at trial. The Confrontation Clause -- as opposed to other emergency doctrines this Court has in the Fourth Amendment area, for example, the Confrontation Clause has zero to say about the way police officers do their jobs or the way the 911 operators do their jobs. If they go out and collect structured affidavits under oath, if the 911 operator put the caller under oath, there's nothing wrong with that. If the 911 operator says, I want to be sure I have this right, describe to me exactly what he looks like, and tell me more about him, that's what we would want somebody to do. And we shouldn't put a perverse incentive for these first responders that, all of a sudden, once they start gathering useful information for the criminal justice system, that some sort of new rule triggers. All we're saying is that these are the kinds of statements that were -- that the Framers would have cared about and that they did care about, and that nowadays if the State or other prosecutors want to use them, they should be duty-bound to bring the witness into court as well to submit the witness to cross examination. If there are no further questions, I'll submit the case.",
  "Well, this Court noticed that Professor Wigmore had the view that the Confrontation Clause applied only to witnesses that actually took the stand. So he would have thought the Confrontation Clause didn't apply at all. But he would have acknowledged to you -- and this is interesting from his treatise -- that these were testimonial statements. He said as soon as somebody starts -- as soon as in a criminal trial we use a statement narrating a past event, it's testimonial. However, Professor Wigmore just didn't quite have the Confrontation Clause right.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Amy Hammon's oral statements to Officer Mooney arose in an emergency situation very similar to a 911 call, not in a situation where a detective was attempting to subvert the judicial system by developing evidence in secret with no intention of ever letting the witness testify at trial.",
  "She may -- yes, I think.",
  "Well, I don't know about that. She was in the living room.",
  "Well, what we know is that the --",
  "I respectfully disagree, Your Honor. We're talking about a woman who has -- has stated that she has suffered a beating from her husband, that -- a beating that may flare up at any time if the officers withdraw, and the officer needs to know what happened so that he can properly address the situation.",
  "Well, I think it's -- the -- the moment to consider is not just the moment when the officers are present, but in fact, what would happen if the officers were to do nothing, which is one of the choices that, I suppose, the officers had. They could find out what was going on and address the situation, or they could withdraw, doing nothing, and then leave Amy Hammon to her own devices in a highly explosive situation. They -- we don't know exactly what -- what Officer Mooney said when he went back into the living room, but what we know is that there was no apparent interrogation of any type. We know that Amy Hammon at that point told him the story of the argument that had taken place and the resulting physical abuse. Now, what we know from -- from the accusation test that is put forth by -- by the petitioner is that the reason that it doesn't apply apparently to all statements to -- to police officers is that it must somehow take account of the co-conspirator statement. But we don't otherwise have any grounding of that test in the history of the Confrontation Clause. The test that we are proposing, the broader test that we are proposing, the resemblance test, flows directly from statements in Crawford suggesting that the way that we know what is testimonial and what is not is by examining the lessons of history. What we're proposing is that in any particular context, if the statement resembles one of those historical abuses in the civil law tradition, then in that circumstance it's testimonial. But if the --",
  "Your Honor, I think the important lesson from Crawford in that regard is -- is the methodology, and the methodology was let's look at history. What does history tell us the Founders were concerned about? And the Court listed the specific examples of affidavits, depositions, pretrial hearings, and -- and expanded that even to include interrogation. And in -- excuse me -- particular cases coming -- coming up, if there is evidence that -- that the statements do correspond to historical abuses, even if those abuses were not listed in Crawford, then that would be a different situation. That would be testimonial.",
  "Well, except that we do know that -- that affidavits, I agree, would have been prohibited, and that's one of the classic forms of testimony, indeed, that was enumerated in Crawford and that was kept out at the founding. And that falls into a very well-defined category.",
  "Well, I think it ostensibly could be. I think what we know, though, looking back at what -- at the -- at the Raleigh trial and at -- at the -- at the trials even in the colonial period, was that the Founders were concerned about abuses by the State, in -- in particular, in interrogations and in eliciting these affidavits and in using pretrial testimony.",
  "The false charges scenario is --",
  "Again, I think what Crawford was talking about, in terms of trying to understand the Confrontation Clause, was not simply to hypothesize various problems that different types of evidence could present if it weren't cross examined, but instead to examine more particularly what the Founders were concerned about. And that was not one of the -- of the categories simply --",
  "I think that -- well, certainly it's testimonial, and so --",
  "Well, whether it would have come in --",
  "Whether it would have been a problem under the Marian practice I think is only part of the story. And certainly Crawford recognized that affidavits as a category were part of the -- of the tradition that led to the abuses that the Founders were concerned about. So Marian is, again, part of the story but not necessarily the whole thing. Now, when we articulate this resemblance --",
  "Well, I -- I don't know that I would because, again, you've got the -- you've got the form that Crawford was concerned about. The affidavit is the classic form.",
  "Well, I don't know that the analysis has to end there. I think, for example, there were other circumstances where other types of communications were problematic. In -- in Raleigh's trial, for example, Cobham had submitted a letter, and that was recited as part of the -- the concern. Now, if the Court were to determine that a recording of that sort was similar enough, it resembled enough that sort of abuse, then yes, it could be testimonial.",
  "I think that there is evidence historically that a letter would be testimonial, certainly coming out of Cobham's case and -- and other circumstances.",
  "Well, I think it's -- it's a matter of what -- what is covered, what is mentioned in history. Affidavit is one of those -- those categories. Letters, in particular, in Raleigh's trial was another area that may have been problematic. And I think --",
  "Well, I think that that is the -- whether we have the resemblance test doesn't require us to answer that question because I think that the examination the Court would undertake would again --",
  "I think it's -- I think it is very similar to the letter and -- and could well be inadmissible, but I don't know that it's -- if the Court adheres to the test that it set forth in Crawford, that it's looking for forms of testimony that were prohibited at common law, certainly that would not have been one of them.",
  "I think that's -- that's right. Now, if it's -- if you have a videotape of someone that -- that's responding to an interrogation, that's an entirely different thing.",
  "But a videotape of a crime scene again would be -- would be not testimonial.",
  "I think that there's a high chance that could be -- be excluded.",
  "It's the resemblance test, and the question --",
  "To the historical abuses that the Founders were trying to address. And the --",
  "Well, which were in particular, we know, affidavits. We also know something about letters, and the question with the tape recording is, is it enough like, does it resemble those enough?",
  "Well, I think the abuse comes not simply in how they were created, but -- but then in how they were later used. And -- and again, we're talking about trying to -- to craft a rule in part that has some bright lines to it based on -- on just what was -- what forms were not used --",
  "I certainly think that that follows from the -- the overall test we propose.",
  "Our position is it's a corollary to it. And certainly it's a narrower test and applies, I think, here in -- in both cases to that, and it provides the opportunity resolve both cases on the notion that when the officers were at the scene, they were in no way behaving like inquisitors. They showed up. They were -- they could -- they were in the middle of -- of an abusive situation that could explode at any time, and they needed to know what -- what was going on in order to diffuse the situation. So this case could be resolved on that -- on a much narrower ground. It's -- it's important here also to -- to recognize that what the -- what the prosecution did has no -- no similarity to what would happen at the common law. We have here the government issuing a subpoena to Amy Hammon to come and testify and, obviously, showing that they would have preferred the live testimony in this case.",
  "There was no such effort, Your Honor. But, well, here, if I may be permitted to go beyond the record just a little bit, what we -- what we do know is that the case was continued one time because Amy Hammon did not show up in response to a subpoena, and that the second time, the -- the trial proceeded. But there was no effort to send someone out to -- to enforce it or to bring any sort of contempt sanction.",
  "That's right, yes.",
  "Correct.",
  "Correct.",
  "Well, I think whether you look at it from her perspective or from the officer's perspective, that something did change in the moment between the oral statement and the affidavit. If you look at it from -- from the officer's perspective, once Amy Hammon disclosed to him what had happened and -- and gave him information that he needed to handle the situation, then he could go about handling the situation. He didn't need the affidavit to do that. Once he turned to get the affidavit, he -- he was transitioning to -- less from an emergency mode and more to an evidence-gathering mode. If you're -- if you are looking at it from the standpoint of Amy Hammon, then at that point, when -- when Officer Mooney is -- is in the house and has her husband, you know, in another room and she's trying to just describe what's going on so that she can be protected, that's a far different mind set.",
  "Well, I think it's reasonable to assume that officers, faced with an emergency situation, are primarily going to be working for -- from a concern of safety, for their own and for others. And so even if it is a mixed motive, I think that the point is that particular circumstance, it's reasonable to infer where there's an emergency -- ongoing emergency, an ongoing immediate safety concern, that safety and security are going to be the primary motive.",
  "Well, let me be clear that we're not suggesting a subjective inquiry into the officer's motive, but what we are saying is that whether a statement is testimonial depends on whether the government is -- is purely collecting evidence, making someone undergo an interrogation, for example, or whether they are performing tasks that really were not part of -- of any type of police function at the founding, which is sort of a community caretaking, public safety function, so that by definition in eliciting statements concerning the immediate safety issue, the police officer could not have been engaged in the kinds of abuses that gave rise --",
  "I'm not sure if I'm following. Not formality --",
  "Well, again, the -- the difficult task of understanding the Confrontation Clause is to figure out what limits there might be, and -- and in Crawford, the methodology was what does history tell us the Framers were concerned about. And certainly the formal affidavit was something that they were very concerned about. The less formal forms they were not. And certainly when it comes to something as -- as recent, you know, relatively speaking, as -- as the community caretaking function of the police, that was in no way part of -- of the abuses that the Framers were concerned about. And so I think even if the Court were to limit its decision to that part of the test, resolving the other instances, according to the resemblance test or -- or trying to figure out where to draw that -- you know, that line, could come later, consistent with its decision in this case.",
  "Well, I'm not entirely sure if that's the case. I mean, I -- of course, they were operating in a -- in a circumstance where -- where hearsay rules were -- were part of trial process. Certainly also, to the extent that -- that a particular procedure is -- is outrageous, the -- a due process concern might arise, but --",
  "I think it was with respect to -- to the abuses that -- testimony elicited through the abuses that gave rise to the clause, the -- the common -- or I'm sorry -- the civil law type abuses. They did want to test that, but the concern --",
  "I think that -- that that's largely accurate, but they were dealing with, I think, a rather set form.",
  "Well, yes, but -- but if I may add a clarification, which is to say, the reason I think that we could circumscribe affidavits, regardless of whether the elicitation abuses are present, is simply for ease of administration, that abuses known to the Framers would have been arising in a circumstance where there would have been those abuses, and -- and as a form --",
  "We don't know exactly all of the details that would have -- that they were contemplating.",
  "Because of -- of what we do know and what Crawford said that we do know, which is that we know that they were responding to things like Raleigh's trial and to Stamp Act, you know, enforcement, other --",
  "Again, if I may be permitted to finish. The methodology -- the methodology of Crawford is to look for known circumstances of abuse, about which the Framers were concerned, and we don't have that sort of historical evidence more generally.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At the moment a trial court impermissibly disqualifies a defendant's retained counsel of choice, it violates the Sixth Amendment. It is not necessary to wait and see what happens at any trial that follows, and indeed, in our view --",
  "Well, this Court already has a body of jurisprudence, beginning with Powell against Alabama, that decides when a judge acts within his discretion in denying a continuance, for example, to allow the defendant to get the retained counsel of his choice. We'll -- we'll leave that jurisprudence where we found it when we showed up today because here, it's undisputed in the record, and the -- and the United States does not dispute in this Court, that the denial was impermissible --",
  "But --",
  "We don't -- we don't believe that's the --",
  "We don't think that's the case, Justice Kennedy. In this Court's jurisprudence, you've already recognized that trial judges have substantial discretion, both in terms of calendaring and efficiency concerns, and in the Wheat case, for things like conflicts in interest to regulate when the defendant is able to proceed with the defendant -- I'm sorry -- with the lawyer he's chosen. As I said, we're not asking to change the status quo in any respect here because here it's undisputed that the trial judge had no legitimate reason to deny the defendant --",
  "Well, it seems -- you know, perhaps we could imagine a scenario, Mr. Chief Justice, where the defendant effectively waives his right, and if he came out and said so much to the court. But certainly it is our position that if he's denied the first-choice counsel against his wishes and without any legitimate justification, a Sixth Amendment violation occurs right then and there.",
  "That's right. And that goes to the heart of the kind of right that we're talking about today, and this is the critical difference between the counsel of choice right and the Strickland right. And the difference is in -- in the counsel of choice right, the Government has affirmatively acted to interfere with the way the defendant wants to conduct his defense and has every right to conduct his defense --",
  "No, he doesn't, Your Honor. The --",
  "-- the defendant who has counsel of his -- who's -- who's appointed counsel does have a limited right to control certain fundamental decisions in his defense such as whether he testifies, whether he accepts a plea offer. So there is even some autonomy that resides in the defendant who has appointed counsel. But the critical distinction --",
  "Certainly that happens, Justice Scalia.",
  "You know, there are -- there are certain instances where a defendant may be so -- have so little basis for doing so or may be -- you know, may be asking too much of the court --",
  "The -- the autonomy interest in this case is the defendant's right to control his defense. It's the defendant's right, as this Court put it in Faretta and later in McKaskle, to control the way his case --",
  "Well, this Court -- I mean, in numerous areas of this Court's jurisprudence, not just in criminal procedure, this Court recognizes that there -- people have certain rights, but if they have the means to effectuate those rights, they're in a better position than people that don't. Take the First Amendment. The First Amendment protects people with printing presses, but the Government doesn't have to go around giving other people printing presses in order to -- to say what they want to say. So what we're talking about here is the 10 percent, or whatever number we want to ascribe to it, of defendants who have the -- the ability and the means to hire retained counsel. And at the moment a trial court tells them, for no legitimate reason, you cannot go forward with this person, that's what we submit constitutes a Sixth Amendment violation. And in --",
  "In some cases, that's true, Mr. Chief Justice, although I would hasten to -- to tell you that even in the context of defendants who can retain counsel, very often, if their retained counsel is disqualified, they're forced, as in this case -- they're simply out of money and have to go forward with local counsel. So as practical terms, I'm not quite sure that's right. But, yes, we are talking about a small universe of people, but it's an important universe of people. It's people that come into court and they say this is how I want to conduct my defense. In McKaskle, talking about the self-representation right, this Court said that oftentimes the messenger is as important as the message in -- in a criminal defendant's case.",
  "I think only in the case of an acquittal. And -- and there -- and there, of course, we don't have an appeal. But, Justice Alito, I think this goes back --",
  "-- to the Twinkie --",
  "I think you'd have a constitutional violation, but it would, in fact, be harmless, and I don't think you'd have a 1983 action because --",
  "Okay. Well, I -- I think what I'll say is then we have an immunity problem with bringing the 1983 case.",
  "Let me say two things to that, Justice Alito. The first is that's akin to the hypotheticals in the United States' brief. We've -- we're not aware of that situation ever having occurred. But if it did, yes, you would have a violation. And it's important to separate the right from the remedy here. We would unquestionably have a Sixth Amendment violation when the trial court, for no legitimate reason, said, you cannot go forward with the counsel of choice. Now, the only question I think you're framing is whether we'd have a Chapman case there. But this just brings up, Justice Scalia's Twinkie case, and to take away --",
  "Well --",
  "Well, I'll try to do even better than Uncle Vinnie, and say in our brief we talk about a case, the Euel Lee case, which is a case where a black defendant wanted to go forward with his counsel of choice in -- in the District of Maryland, and he was forced to go ahead with a more experienced, establishment-type counsel and -- and to his detriment. So -- so we proceed at our peril where we say that the defendant doesn't have the right to decide what's best for him. The core right, which this Court recognized in Wheat -- we would submit to the Court that this Court saying in Wheat there's a presumption that the defendants have the right to proceed with counsel of choice really can't be explained in any other way than saying that the right -- the Sixth Amendment right here goes beyond simply a fair trial and does encompass an autonomy interest. And to conceptualize that autonomy interest within the Sixth Amendment the way that Wheat does is simply to say that the right to counsel of choice is like any number of other Sixth Amendment rights, which is to say, trial judges have the power to curtail it or qualify it when they have legitimate reasons for things like the integrity of the courts, for things like the efficiency of the docket, Justice Kennedy, and lots of other things. The same is true of self-representation. A defendant does not have an unqualified right to self- representation. A defendant can be forced to have standby counsel. The defendant can even have his right to self-representation taken away if he's too -- too disruptive in the courtroom. So the same kinds of concerns --",
  "That's right. And there is -- the United States raises in its brief the -- the supposed danger that courts and prosecutors will be too hesitant to challenge selected counsel of choice, but you've already taken that fully in consideration in your Wheat decision. I mean, that's the basis for this Wheat decision is to say these are decisions that have to be made at the outset of trial. And so, therefore, we're going to give trial judges substantial latitude and broad discretion to decide when -- when the defendant has to accept a different lawyer.",
  "Well, it's not contested in this case that the -- that the pro hac vice denial did violate the Sixth Amendment. So I'm not sure -- this isn't something you have to deal with in this case. But, yes, this would be a right that would -- that would go forward on appeal, provided the defendant walked into court and said this is the person who I want to go forward with me, and the court, under its rules and practices and in the substantial discretion that court has in Wheat, if the trial court simply went -- if the court simply went off the reservation and said, no, you can't have this person for no reason, there would be.",
  "It might, Justice Ginsburg. And to be frank with you, I haven't thought all the way through the consequences --",
  "No, you're not.",
  "So there is a difference, of course, this Court has recognized in its Martinez case, that takes place. But to bring the point home, in -- in Wheat, simply saying that the defendant has the right to counsel of choice unless the trial court has a good reason for saying no, would make this right just like lots of other rights in the Sixth Amendment, the right to self-representation, the right to cross-examination, all the other rights in the Sixth Amendment that can give way for efficiency or integrity concerns. But what the United States is suggesting is something radically different that we submit doesn't exist anywhere else in constitutional law, which is to say that this Court recognizes that a certain right exists, but when it's arbitrarily denied, the defendant simply has no remedy unless he can affirmatively show his own prejudice.",
  "It --",
  "I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. The critical difference between this and the right to effective assistance of counsel is the affirmative action by the court. And in Strickland itself at page 686, this Court recognized the Geders -- the Geders decision, the Brooks decision, the Herring decision, which are all accepted by the Solicitor General in footnote 3 of its brief. And the core holding of those cases is when the court interferes with what the defendant wants to do, then a Sixth Amendment violation takes place right then and there, and we don't look at all to whether prejudice took place.",
  "Let me answer it both on the facts and on the law. On the facts of this case, there was a pretrial sanction hearing in which the prosecutor showed up unannounced to the defense and actually submitted witnesses and evidence to support the disqualification of Mr. Low. So, yes, the prosecutor did play a part and support the disqualification in this case. Now, to answer your question on the law and the practicalities, we're here today defending the status quo because the rule in every Federal circuit is that on direct appeal if the right to counsel of choice is denied, it's an automatic reversal. So we're -- we're relying on the practicalities of how things work in the lower courts only to the extent to say it's working fine just now, and this Court ought not to upset that. Right now, by our count, you get probably fewer than one case a year in the Federal courts of appeals where a scenario as rare as this arises. And so we think that this Court's incentives, which are put in place by the Wheat case, as I was talking about, get it just right. They get it so that, yes, there's a little bit of hesitance, but on the other hand, trial judges have substantial discretion in making these threshold decisions. And so we submit --",
  "I'm not aware of any case, Justice Kennedy, where an express finding of bad faith is placed on the record. But -- but, of course, that points out one of the -- one of the things about this kind of case is that we just have a record in many ways. What the United States is suggesting is that we should have these satellite collateral proceedings where we have to not just investigate questions like that perhaps, but also recreate an entire trial. And this is much more difficult than the Strickland scenario because, as Justice Alito pointed out, in Strickland we can at least compare the defendant -- the defendant's lawyer's performance against an objective -- an objective counsel. And even -- and it's even easier than that because, because of the performance prong, the first prong of the Strickland test, we winnow out the decisions that lawyer made to probably just two or three. I mean, in this Court's typical Strickland case, it looks at one or two decisions a trial judge -- the trial counsel made. In this context, we'd have to look not just at an entire trial, but at the entire attorney-client relationship from the moment the -- the counsel would have met the defendant, all of the different decisions that might have taken place in terms of investigation, negotiation, strategy before trial, strategy during trial. And what you'd be asking is for this first- choice counsel presumably to take the stand or file some sort of affidavit not saying this is the strategy that would have -- would have necessarily happened because he didn't get to try the case. What -- what you'd be asking this person to do is sort of take the stand and hypothesize what he might have done in all these various situations --",
  "-- with all the problems of hindsight.",
  "Well, I mean, our rule would -- would apply in a guilty plea case, provided the defendant didn't waive it, didn't waive the -- the argument in his guilty plea. But the problem with -- you know, to look at the other side, imagine the -- the case where the defendant's first-choice counsel is disqualified and he does plead guilty and he wants to plead guilty, which, of course, happens in over 90 percent of the criminal cases in the country. There, we have an enormous problem because how is that person supposed to show on appeal what would have happened with his first-choice lawyer? First of all, under the -- under the United States conception, which conflates this -- this right with Strickland, they have the problem of this Court's decision in Hill against Lockhart which holds that a defendant doesn't have an ineffective assistance type claim unless he can show that he wouldn't have pleaded guilty at all but for his counsel's advice. And secondly, we have the problem, once again, of just the crazy kind of predictions that we have start to engage in. We -- I suppose there in a guilty plea case, we have to put the -- the first- choice lawyer on the stand to testify to all the various things he might have done. Then perhaps we have to put the prosecutor on the stand to say, oh, would you have taken the deal if this would have taken place and that would have taken place and the other would have taken place. And -- and what we submit is that not only is -- is this fundamentally improper because once we have a constitutional violation, the only -- the only choices on appeal are Chapman error and structural error, and all of this is outside the record. So it would be impossible to do under Chapman.",
  "That is part of the record, Justice Ginsburg. The lawyer that the defendant wanted in this case had appeared in the very same court several months before before the very same judge and stepped in on the eve of trial and negotiated an extremely favorable plea agreement for the defendant in that case. And that's how Mr. Gonzalez-Lopez learned about Mr. Low and that's why he sought him out. I don't think it's a part of the record whether he wanted to plead guilty or whether he wanted to go to trial.",
  "But that's certainly one of his considerations.",
  "Well, for two reasons, Mr. Chief Justice. First of all, the Seventh Circuit, with due respect, simply misconceived the right. It's our fundamental submission here that the right is violated at the moment the trial judge impermissibly disqualifies the counsel, and that's what the Seventh Circuit didn't understand. Once you say that that violates the right, then your only choices, under this Court's jurisprudence -- what it said in Neder was the only two choices are structural error or a Chapman review. The Seventh Circuit, of course, was deciding a habeas case. It had an evidentiary -- it had the ability to compile an evidentiary record, but once you recognize that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice is violated at the moment of the disqualification, then your only choices are Strickland -- I'm sorry -- are Chapman or structural error. The Seventh Circuit way of doing things, which the United States to some degree embraces, of having an evidentiary hearing on collateral review proves the point why we can't say this is subject to harmless error review because we don't have the stuff in the record that we need. And that's what the Seventh Circuit didn't -- didn't -- first of all, it wasn't speaking to it because, of course, it was deciding a habeas case. But it --",
  "Oh, well, there's -- there's two big problems with what the -- with the United States' position on that point, Justice Kennedy. The first is, I -- I think as -- as came out, if mandamus became too common, it would effectively overrule this Court's Flanagan decision. But there's an even more fundamental problem, which is to say that mandamus is only available when a defendant can show a clear violation of a right. Now, the way the United States conceives the right, there's no violation of the right until you haven't received a fair trial. So imagine the defendant going up pretrial on mandamus and saying, my right to counsel of choice has been violated. The appellate court's response would be, well, we can't decide that. We don't even know whether it's been violated until we see the record that develops in this case and the defense that your -- that your replacement counsel puts on.",
  "Justice Scalia, I think I'm fairly characterizing the Government's position when I say that as a constitutional matter, they say there's no Sixth Amendment violation until we see what happens at the trial.",
  "I don't think that's the way that they're presenting their case, Justice Ginsburg, and this is important because what the Government is saying is the right itself is not violated until we have a breakdown in the adversarial process at trial.",
  "Well, you -- if you conceived the right as one that you made clear there's a violation at the moment the trial court impermissibly denies counsel of choice, and then perhaps to say -- and then you went on to say there's either an automatic reversal rule or even a Chapman standard, then you could say that there would be a right for mandamus on appeal. But then you run into the same problem of Flanagan. And then -- but if you didn't do that and he said what the United States --",
  "He may well be.",
  "Well, because --",
  "I think in the ordinary case, yes, but let me talk about -- let me go back to the facts of this case. I mean, we have a defendant here with only very limited funds. He may decide that I only have enough money to pay one lawyer for one trial, and -- and I don't want to depend on this lawyer's good will or something. I mean, so we're getting down the line to -- to hypotheticals.",
  "Yes. I mean, I think I'll accept that mandamus doesn't work. And Justice Kennedy, even on -- even on this record, if you look at the rule of the Eastern District of Missouri for -- for pro hac vice admission, it's entirely discretionary on its face. And so it's hard to imagine what your mandamus argument would be. And, of course, here the Eighth Circuit just issued a one- word dismissal. So it's our position that for -- not only for the legal reasons of the historical grounding of -- of the right to counsel of choice and the logical reasons with the differences between the government interfering with what the defendant wants to do versus the situation that we have in Strickland where this Court has said that even if -- if the government doesn't do anything at all -- and this Court emphasized in Strickland that -- another difference between Strickland and this case is the -- is that the government is powerless in the Strickland scenario to prevent -- to prevent the constitutional violation. When we have the difference here of the government acting to interfere with the way the defendant wants to --",
  "I'm sorry. When I say the government, I mean the court or a prosecutor.",
  "Well, but then those sorts of mistakes aren't necessarily a Sixth Amendment right to counsel arguments, I don't think, Mr. Chief Justice. Those might be different kinds of mistakes. But here, what we're talking about is the court interfering with the right -- the Sixth Amendment right the defendant has. And in the cases that Strickland expressly distinguished and which the United States accepts in footnote 3 of its brief and in the self-representation cases, which -- which recognized that the kernel of the defendant's right is to present -- and this is what the Court said in McKaskle. The core Faretta right is the -- is the defendant's right to present the case to the jury the way he wants to submit it.",
  "What we have in -- what we have in this case is a lawyer who was retained and who's -- who is willing to go forward under that retainer and in a pro bono sense. So -- so, I mean, even under this Court's --",
  "Even under the current -- yes, in this case. Even under the -- even under the current jurisprudence, Justice Alito, you're right. The defendant sometimes may not be able to be put all the way back into the position he -- he would have been. But here, we submit that the lower court's rule of -- of automatic reversal is the proper rule. It's the one that's working, and it's the one this Court should -- should refuse to change today.",
  "It's roughly -- roughly half the circuits have addressed this issue on direct appeal, and they've all said this is structural error, Justice Scalia. If there are no further questions, I'll submit the case.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Complaints alleging violations of the FCC's pay phone compensation regulations allege just that, violations of regulations. The regulatory violations do not give rise to private cause of action under section 206 and 207 of the Communications Act. The proper point of departure in this case begins at section 276. There Congress directed the FCC to create a system guaranteeing pay phone providers compensation for the services that they provide to callers who make dial around calls. There can be little doubt that the FCC has ample authority to enforce the system it created administratively. But nothing in Section 276 or anywhere else in the Act contemplates that violations of the FCC's implementing regulations should give rise to a private cause of action for damages in Federal court. Accordingly, this Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision allowing pay phone operators to bring through the back door the kinds of cases that Congress declined to allow through the front. There's nothing upsetting about reaching that result here. The Communications Act quite sensibly limits private damages actions in Federal court to those alleging violations of the Act itself. And claims that long distance providers -- I'm sorry -- claims that long distance providers have violated the pay phone compensation regulations require the parsing and the application of the extraordinarily complex and ever-changing FCC rules and regulations and orders.",
  "Yes, Justice Stevens.",
  "Our position is that can be fully enforced in the FCC. And in fact, the FCC is hearing complaints like this all the time.",
  "Yes, by means of an administrative action before the FCC.",
  "That's right. And if you look at the Sprint amicus brief at page 23, the brief cites several cases just like this one that the FCC has fully adjudicated and in some cases awarded damages.",
  "No, we believe -- of course, this Court did not grant certiorari - -",
  "If this Court holds there is no private cause of action in Federal court, then it is not enforceable in state court either. Our position is that there is only an administrative remedy that's available.",
  "In terms of damages, we're talking about exactly the same thing, Justice Ginsburg. The only difference between being in Federal court as opposed to the agency is that if you're in Federal court, the Communications Act has a fee shifting provision. And we think that further underscores the Congress's scheme here, which is to reserve Federal court actions for serious violations of the Communications Act, and that's where fee shifting kicks in. Ordinary - -",
  "That's right.",
  "I think that's very much what the Commission is contending here Justice Souter.",
  "Right.",
  "In a later order, Justice Scalia.",
  "Yes. The result would be the same. And I think you're asking me to put aside for the moment whether the FCC was correct in saying it was a covered practice.",
  "And in terms of the FCC calling this unjust and unreasonable, the problem with that is that the only reason the FCC has ever given that this is unjust and unreasonable is because it violates its regulations. And if there's one thing we know from the structure of the Communications Act, it's that for something to be remedial in Federal court, in other words -- and if we know something violates 201, it is remediable.",
  "It has to be.",
  "Yes, because the reasoning the FCC would give simply would not be a permissible construction of the terms unjust and unreasonable in 201(b).",
  "Of course, in the vast majority. Let me give you some examples, and then I'll distinguish it from this case. The easiest example is rate of return regulations that the FCC can pronounce. So the FCC can say how much long distance companies are able to charge for certain services. Fleshing out the amount that they can charge so that they're not in effect gouging consumers is a regulation that this Court could look to, but - -",
  "Well, that goes to the heart of this case, Justice Souter, in the kind of regulations that we have. What we have here is not the FCC telling long distance providers to give pay phone operators money that long distance operators ought to owe pay phone operators. The money that's at issue here, the 24 cents per call is the money that callers owe the pay phone operators. If you look back at the D.C. Circuit's decision - -",
  "You are right, Justice Souter, insofar as we're trying to capture the money here for essentially the equipment rental or the access fee that the caller is availing himself of. But Congress has not said that money cannot rest on the caller's shoulders. All Congress says in Section 226 is that the caller cannot be required to pay in advance. The FCC during its rulemaking proceedings actually considered two alternatives where the caller would have paid in full compliance with Section 226. One would be the caller paying with a later billing device like a credit card, billing it to their home phone number. Another option the FCC considered would have been where the long distance providers would have billed customers on behalf of the pay phone operators. Either way, the customer would have paid. Even the respondent in his brief openly - -",
  "The economic result may be the same, but with all due respect, Congress has not decreed that the administrative system work this way.",
  "It hasn't decreed otherwise. Congress essentially - -",
  "Congress gave the FCC power in 276 to come up with a plan. But this case, as the Ninth Circuit decided it is not under 276, it is under 201, so the question is whether failing to comply with the administrative plan - -",
  "That's right. I'm sorry. It brings us back to the question that you asked: Whether the Ninth Circuit, or the FCC for that matter, can shoehorn this into 201 as an unjust and unreasonable practice.",
  "Well, Chief Justice Roberts, the FCC was unquestionably acting under 276 when it did this. So the question is whether you can go back to 201. And as I said, you need to start with section 206 and 207 because we're in Federal court. And that says that violations of the Act are remediable but not of regulations, in contrast to numerous other sections. So the question in asking whether it violates 201, it has to be something more than simply the FCC's regulation wasn't followed. And we need to ask ourselves what kind of regulation is it.",
  "That's right. That's what I conceded to Justice Souter earlier.",
  "I think largely they are.",
  "That's right.",
  "That's right. And this Court can look several places, but it can first look to these -- this regulatory regime that was created, which was always thought of as being triggered by section 276. And then asking - -",
  "In its order, it references 276 and 201. In the regulations -- I thought I was being asked about the regulations -- it leads with 276.",
  "No, it wouldn't be. And I think I want to flesh out and make sure I've gotten across the distinction between the rate making - -",
  "There are two things that are wrong with that, Justice Breyer. The first thing is that in contrast to ordinary rate making regulations, here, in the absence of regulations, long distance providers would owe pay phone operators zero. There's no reason why long distance providers would give money to pay phone operators. The 24 cents here is to capture what callers owe the pay phone operators. And so the FCC has come up with an administrative system. But there's nothing unjust or unreasonable about long distance providers not giving money to pay phone operators before the regulatory regime drops into place, whereas there is plenty that is unjust and unreasonable about overcharging, for example --",
  "No.",
  "Well, what you should do is reverse the Ninth Circuit.",
  "That's exactly right.",
  "No, it wouldn't. Justice Scalia, I think, has captained that position. And what we're saying is the FCC can pick a fair rate once it is something that long distance providers or any common carrier ought to be compensating somebody for. But what we are saying here is, this is a purely administrative creature. And then it gets to the second reason why - -",
  "No, you would have been right, Justice Breyer. We're not asking -- even the Louisiana Public Service Commission is another example of something. And that brings me -- I think I should go back to what - -",
  "They might. The question that we would ask is whether it affects carriers' relationships to their customers. Now, under Justice Breyer's hypothetical, and this is the Louisiana Public Service Commission - -",
  "I don't think we're disagreeing. What I want to do is distinguish those from the case we have here, and go back to Justice Souter's - -",
  "No, for two reasons. The first is -- I just want to be clear, we are not challenging the FCC's authority to have created the regulatory regime it did under 276. So the FCC could well have picked, as it did, long distance providers to be on the ultimate hook here. But the reason -- but the problem with saying that -- I'm sorry. I lost the train of thought in your question.",
  "Thank you. That would be an entirely different case than the one we have here, Justice Souter. The 24 cents that the respondent is seeking to recoup here, if you go back and look at the regulatory system -- and that's what they are asking for, is the 24 cents that the FCC regulations entitle us to -- was calculated -- in fact, the D.C. Circuit made the FCC go through this exercise three times to get it right. So to calculate that 24 cents, it is purely a function of the amount of money that the caller owes the pay phone operator.",
  "I think another way to perhaps characterize your position is, why is this like a commission that they are seeking. And the reason why is because that number may be very different than 24 cents. If there was such a commission that could exist, it would be far less. And the respondents are not seeking that amount of money.",
  "I don't think so. All I'm saying is if you started with trying to compensate pay phone operators for the service they provide -- that you're characterizing as the service they provide to long distance carriers, you end up with a far different number. Who knows what you would end up with. Probably end up with zero. Because take an example of somebody who rents a cell phone for the weekend. They might make lots of long distance calls on the cell phone, but nobody has ever thought that a long distance carrier ought to be kicking back money, for example, to the store that rented the cell phone to the customer over the weekend. And I want to return, I think in Justice Breyer's question - -",
  "Right, but then we're back to the rental income question, and the question of whether it would be unjust or unreasonable for long distance providers, absent the regulations, to be the ones paying that rental income. And the answer, we submit, is no. And the problem that I think we've gotten off on a couple times brings us back, I think, to the assumption you asked me to make at the beginning of the argument, that something is a covered practice under the Act. And so another way to understand the distinction between the accounting rules, the rate making exercises and all the rest in this case is that section 201(b) of the Act doesn't cover everything in connection with a communications service. It only covers certain practices in connection. And the history, as well as the text and structure, shows that it regulates common carriers acting as such.",
  "I think we agree with respondent, Mr. Chief Justice, that in looking at 201(b), you have the word such communication practices. And to understand what that is referring to, you look back up at 201(a) and see the universe. Now, the beginning of 201(a) is what we colloquially call the carrier customer section of the Act. And that's the core of 201(b), which says that when a common carrier is providing service, it needs to act justly and reasonably. Here -- and with accounting and rate making and all the rest, those are things that affect rates and service to customers. What we have in this case is something very different. This is a carrier-carrier relationship. So you need to look somewhere else. And what respondent says is you look to the end of 201(a), which talks about physical interconnections between carriers. But the problem with that argument, and the reason why this falls outside 201(b), even if it is somehow unjust and unreasonable, is that the carrier-carrier relationships are governed only when the FCC has ordered physical interconnection.",
  "As we're still talking generically, I don't think it necessarily would be. Because it could regulate the relationship between long distance providers and their customers. I mean, that's the core of what 201 is about. It's about how much they can charge, what kind of practices they can have in relationship to their customers. But here we're not talking about a long distance provider that is a common carrier in relationship to its customers or in relation to its rates and practices.",
  "We submit it is a not a \"so what,\" Justice Breyer. Because section 201(b) is broad, but it's not all-encompassing. And Congress plenty of times in section 276, and in lots of other sections of the Communications Act, has responded to modern necessity by giving the FCC expanded jurisdiction, just as it did, as I said here, in section 276. But our core position here is that when Congress expands the FCC's authority, and it doesn't create a concomitant Federal right of action along with it, it is telling the FCC to handle these things administratively, use its expertise, craft regulations and enforce them accordingly.",
  "The FCC might have that authority. Section 154(i), as well as other sections in the Act, give the Commission broad authority in crafting its administrative enforcement regimes. I haven't focused on that exact question, but it might well be able to say that in order to have this properly enforced, we need to have fee shifting.",
  "Yes, it could, and the FCC could double fine -- the FCC could do lots of things. That's our very purpose, is that the FCC ought to be the single forum deciding what kind of an enforcement mechanism is best, not leaving it to Federal courts across the country. And as Ninth Circuit invites, state court rulings across the country with varying rules. If there are no more questions I'll reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Thank you. Let me begin, Mr. Chief Justice, with your question about whether the FCC can opine on remedies. All you need to do is look to what the FCC was telling everybody it was deciding in these order proceedings. It was deciding, and asked for notice and comment, on whether PSPs have a remedy for violations of the pay phone regulations. That is cited everywhere in the briefs. It never asked for notice and comments, or considered whether failure to pay under the regulations is a violation of 201(b). So the question this Court needs to ask itself is when the FCC, by its own acknowledgment, until now, is simply opining on the presence of a Federal court remedy, whether it gets deference simply because it hangs the hook on a substantive provision of the statute. Now, there are three problems with what the FCC has done in construing section 201. The first is that this is not a covered practice, because I want to make clear our position, it's that the FCC has plenty of authority with respect to carrier-customer relationships, but not with respect to carrier-supplier relationships. And that's what we have here. On unjust and unreasonable, I think we need to unpack two separate questions. One is whether the rate the FCC chose is reasonable, whether the amount of money that it said needs to be put into pay phone operators' pockets is a fair and reasonable choice. We have no dispute about that. And we think that in and of itself could generate deference. But the FCC's determination to put the payment obligation on long distance carriers simply can't be shoehorned into the unjust and unreasonable phrase in 201(b), because if that's -- the only reason why anything, us failing to pay the money, would be because of the regulations. And you hear it again and again in their argument, the FCC having concluded that long distance companies are the ones that pay, the failure to pay is unjust and unreasonable. There's no way to get there without the regulations, and that's what distinguishes - -",
  "The FCC might have said that, but as I said to Justice Souter, that would be a very different proceeding and a very different scheme than we have here, and a very different dollar figure or cent figure that the FCC might have come up with when it was trying to encapsulate that figure, which we think is zero, but under your reasoning may be something very small. But that would be a very different case. Two more things. One is, on the jurisdictional mismatch question, Mr. Chief Justice, you are exactly right. It is not hard -- there are plenty of hard things in this case, but figuring out whether a call is interstate or intrastate is not one of them. All you need to know is where the call originated from, and the number that was dialed, and pay phone operators have that information.",
  "This is a pay phone case. So all you need to know is the cell phone number and that - -",
  "I think it still constitutes a long distance call, depending on where the cell phone owner lives. And that's still an easy thing to figure out, where the area code is. Finally, Justice Stevens, you asked a question about the co-extensive nature of the remedies under 206 and 208. We don't dispute that the statute itself is co-extensive. What we're saying is that 276 gives the FCC more than ample authority to do what it's doing. Nobody has denied that, and so we think that that's the place to look for the FCC to craft the arrangement under Southwestern Cable. Combined with section 154(i), the FCC would have ample authority to do that.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Sharp versus Pain, the Ninth Circuit opinion that first decided the question that's before you today, the Ninth Circuit said, and I'm quoting: \"The rule of Blakely that the statutory maximum is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict, was not clear until the Blakely decision itself.\" The Ninth Circuit is simply wrong. In this Court's Apprendi decision it laid down precisely that rule. At page 483 of that decision this Court described the statutory maximum concept as, quote, \"the maximum a defendant would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict alone\" -- virtually the identical language.",
  "Yes, he does, Justice Souter.",
  "It's precisely the same kind of fact that the judge had to find in Blakely itself. Under the Washington, Revised Code of Washington, the statute, the statute for running sentences consecutively in the fashion that Mr. Burton's were run consecutively, refers the judge back to the very same provision that was at issue in Blakely itself, which is the aggravating factors provision of Washington, which was formerly codified at section 390 and is now codified at section 400.",
  "That would be a fact, Justice Souter, but that is not the way the Washington law works. It is colloquially known as the free crime aggravator. But in the Washington Supreme Court decision in Hughes which is cited at the end of our reply brief the Washington Supreme Court made clear that to invoke that aggravator a court has to find that there was extraordinarily serious culpability or extraordinarily serious harm that accompanies the multiple offenses.",
  "That's right. And this Court's decision -- I'm sorry. The Washington Supreme Court decision in Hughes clearly lays that out. If you have any doubt about the way the consecutive sentences work in Washington, I want to give you one other citation, to a new Washington Court of Appeals decision that considers a consecutive sentences imposed exactly the same way that Mr. Burton's was. That is to say, they are run consecutively based on the clearly too lenient factor. That case is called State versus Washington and it was just reported at 143 P.3d 606, 143 P.3d 606. The Washington Court of Appeals in that case, considering a sentence just like Mr. Burton's, says that it does trigger and violate Blakely.",
  "Exactly, it's part of the same list. And as this Court said in Apprendi itself, that extra culpability, which is one of the ways this aggravator can be met, is the quintessential type of element that needs to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt .",
  "That's right, Justice Breyer. In section -- the current section is section 589 of the Washington Code and it says that sentences shall run exactly the same type the judge is required to find in Blakely. And if you look at Blakely itself, remember Blakely involved concurrent sentences. And so what Washington is doing is saying all sentences should run concurrently unless there's an extra fact, something about the additional crimes that would otherwise be running concurrently, that simply requires the judge to go above and beyond the ordinary concurrent sentences and punish those crimes separately.",
  "No, it couldn't, and the Washington decision that I've cited to you will help you with this, because it makes it clear that to trigger an aggravator to run sentences concurrently, just as under Blakely itself, there has to be something above and beyond the elements of the crime or the crimes themselves. It can't simply be -- I'm sorry. It can't simply be that there were three crimes committed and all three of them are very serious. It has to be something about the crime, the additional crimes, that takes it above and beyond the ordinary commission of that crime.",
  "I'm not sure I follow, Justice Stevens.",
  "You're certainly right that in this case you needed to have an extra finding of fact. There are some situations under the Washington Code and I believe in the majority of other States where it is up to the judge's discretion whether to run sentences concurrently, and he could do it for the reason that Justice Souter described. So what Washington does in its respondent's brief is it cites these other State decisions, from other States that simply have different sentencing systems than we have in Washington.",
  "Under some State systems that might be the case, Mr. Chief Justice. However, in Washington the way that the code works is that judges are directed that for multiple crimes the sentences shall run consecutively.",
  "Unless they make the exact kind of extra finding, and it refers them to the precise same statute that was at issue in Blakely itself.",
  "That's right.",
  "If the judge needs to make an extra finding beyond the elements of either of those two crimes to run them consecutively, then it would violate Blakely.",
  "You haven't had a case in the Apprendi-Blakely line of cases dealing with consecutive sentences. But what you've done is laid down a rule from the very State that we're dealing with here that says that if the judge needs to make an extra finding beyond the elements of the crimes of conviction and beyond the facts encompassed in the jury's finding of guilt for those crimes, then those findings need to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. That's why in this case that line, that rule, is triggered. The Ninth Circuit of course didn't talk about any of this. What it said, as I mentioned, is that it simply took Apprendi to be a purely formalistic rule that had nothing to do with the facts according to the jury verdict, but it just had to do with whatever the State happened to label as the statutory maximum. In Apprendi this Court said, not once but three times, that the statutory maximum concept was triggered according to the facts encompassed in the jury verdict. And like the Washington courts, the Ninth Circuit simply ignored that language in this Court's opinion. Lest there be any doubt about the way that concept mapped onto this case, this Court said in Apprendi itself that the relevant inquiry was not one of form but one of effect: Does the required finding take a defendant to a higher sentence level than would otherwise be permissible based on the facts encompassed in the jury verdict?",
  "This is the very first petition that Mr. Burton has filed against the 1998 judgment. He did file earlier a petition against the original judgment of 1994. In the joint appendix at page 34, that is where that petition is reprinted. He says quite clearly that he is challenging the 1994 judgment in that petition, whereas here this is his first petition against the 1998 judgment.",
  "That's right, Justice Ginsburg. And if what the State is saying is correct, which is to say that we don't have any judgment at all until the sentence is final, then all you get from that is that Mr. Burton's first petition should have been dismissed and the court could have gotten it dismissed. But we submit what you can't do from that is retroactively change the first petition that he explicitly told the court was against the 1994 judgment, and that he told the court in that same filing on JA 35 and JA 40, that his sentence was still on direct review. You can't retroactively change that challenge to the 1994 judgment into one against the 1998 judgment, for two reasons. One is that if the State is right, the district court wouldn't have had jurisdiction under that 1998 -- challenge against the 1998 judgment either, because as Mr. Burton forthrightly told the court, that sentence was still on direct review. But even if you get past that, we submit that this Court's Castro decision simply doesn't allow a court, especially retroactively, to recharacterize a habeas petition that the petitioner himself said was against one judgment as against another.",
  "No, there can't, Justice Kennedy. And so what should have happened according to the state's theory, is that the first petition should, should simply have been dismissed.",
  "I think that's -- this Court hasn't laid down a solid decision. But I think that's a better reading.",
  "Am I asking - -",
  "I think that is a fair characterization, Justice Kennedy. But what Mr. Burton did is he want to the district court saying I'm challenging the 1994 judgment. And as I was saying, under Castro before that gets recharacterized - -",
  "I don't think so. But I'm just recognizing that that's a jurisdictional question that this Court would decide for itself. But assuming that he can't do that, what the district court would have had to say is, Mr. Burton, you're not allowed to challenge the 1994 judgment. And let's assume for the moment he could have challenged the 1998 judgment. The district judge would have said, \"Now Mr. Burton, you're only challenging your conviction for the 1994 judgment. You need to wait until you're ready to challenge your sentence, and then you can challenge the 1998 judgment.\" Presumably -- and this is I think a fair inference especially from the petition itself as it is reprinted, since he told the district court that he was challenging his sentence, if he was told he couldn't bring it at that time he would have said okay, I will withdraw it and wait until I can challenge my sentence.",
  "I don't know that we would, Justice Souter.",
  "Because it is a common rule that -- this Court hasn't had a case exactly like this, but the lower courts do all the time; and the Fourth Circuit case in Taylor which I've cited in the reply brief is one of them. Where, it is a common practice for a petitioner to bring one petition against a judgment and then be partially successful, and then bring a new petition against something in the new judgment. And that's essentially what happened here. And it may - -",
  "No, you put your finger on it exactly. And so, but we still think that, that, either the court had jurisdiction or it didn't. And if it had jurisdiction, then it must be -- fall in somehow into the category that you're talking about.",
  "Could a district judge have done that?",
  "I think what would have needed to have happened here, since Mr. Burton at pages 35 and 40 of the joint appendix, told the district judge, I'm still challenging my sentence on direct appeal, under AEDPA and customary comity principles, the judge would have needed to say, you need either to renounce that appeal from the State court or renounce this one. You couldn't do both at the same time. Mr. Burton, if he had wanted to, I think it is fair to say, could have gone into district court and said, I now have a new judgment and I'm going to challenge my conviction and sentence because I have no intention of challenging my sentence through State court proceedings. And perhaps he could have done that. But that would be a very different situation than what we have here. If I can turn back to the, not a new rule question, another angle at this is not simply to look at the text of this Court's opinion in Apprendi which we submit told a State court in this situation all it would have needed to know, but also perhaps it is helpful to look behind that and look at the statutes that were in play in New Jersey and in Washington. And even if you did that it becomes, we submit, very clear that a district judge, any reasonable trial judge, that is, would have known that Apprendi applied here. What you had in New Jersey was essentially two statutes. One that said an ordinary commission of a crime is punishable up to 10 years. And a second statute that said if you commit that crime with some kind of extra -- extra bad circumstance, there a hate crime, then you get -- you can get a higher sentence. Exactly the same thing was true in Washington. We had one statute that said this is what the, this is what the punishment is for the ordinary commission of this crime. And we had an extra statute that said, but if you commit that crime with extra bad circumstances -- and here the only difference was, there was a list of circumstances, not just a single one - - but if you commit the crime with extra circumstances, then you can get extra punishment. And the analogy that the respondents want to draw between the Washington sentencing system and the Federal guidelines just simply doesn't hold up.",
  "I think that's fair to say, Mr. Chief Justice. Because in Blakely all you needed to do was apply Apprendi which said that if you have two different statutory thresholds, the pertinent threshold for Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment purposes is the one that cabins the judge's discretion based on the facts in the jury verdict. To decide Booker this Court had to take the term statutory maximum and apply that to a different type of threshold, which was as this Court put it a court rule or a quasi legislative enactment. So under -- under the system that this Court reviewed in Booker, you had only a single true statutory maximum. And then you had to decide whether the Apprendi principle ought to be in play for the Federal sentencing guidelines. And if there is any confusion on that, a trial judge could have looked at Apprendi itself where this Court and Justice Thomas's concurrence made clear that there was unique status of the Federal sentencing guidelines that made it a more difficult question. However, here where you didn't have anything like that, we had just a simple situation where there were two statutes, one maximum for the ordinary crime, and then an additional maximum for the crime being committed with aggravating circumstances. And so it was a very clear map line. And that's what this Court said in Blakely, of course. It said, it didn't break any new ground in the decision in Blakely. It simply said that, took the state's argument and rejected it by saying our precedents on this point are clear. And it just simply quoted the Apprendi language, that the statutory maximum for Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment purposes is the maximum that a defendant may receive based on the facts and the jury verdict alone.",
  "There were lower court decisions?",
  "Yes, there were. And I think, if we want to talk about these, it is important first to be clear about what we are talking about. There were, there was a Supreme Court of Kansas that had looked to the relevant language in Apprendi and decided that its sentencing guidelines system could not stand. And then you had, on the other side the Supreme Court of Washington, and the Supreme Court of Oregon, and a couple of other State intermediate courts, I think some in unpublished decisions, that had gone the other way. But I think it is very telling, Justice Ginsburg, if you want to look at those State supreme - - I'm sorry, those State supreme court and lower court decisions, because none of them -- not a single one - - quotes Apprendi or even acknowledges the passages in Apprendi that said the test is not one of form but of effect. And there's several passages in Apprendi that said that the statutory maximum was the maximum allowed based on the facts in the jury verdict. So once you take those into account, we submit, as the Kansas Supreme Court realized, there is only one conclusion that you can reach. The only way those lower courts were able to come to a contrary decision was simply to pluck out -- pluck out other sentences of Apprendi and not acknowledge the rest of the opinion. And of course, the rest of the opinion where this Court has these passages, pages 483, 482, are the absolute guts, the building blocks of the opinion itself. It is where the Court canvasses the historical rule that was incorporated into our constitutional system. And so it is not as though that is some sort of dicta that or loose language that this Court had in its opinion. It was the very guts of the holding of Apprendi. And we submit that, in a Teague analysis where you are indeed supposed to look to whether a reasonable jurist would have found something, not just the fact that they exist, but whether a reasonable jurist would have reached a given conclusion, once you take the whole of Apprendi into account, there was only one conclusion that a reasonable jurist could have come to.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, I think, as I understand the dissents in, in Blakely, the dissents in Blakely primarily were saying that Apprendi itself was a bad idea. And that Apprendi really wasn't dictated by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. I see almost nothing, in fact really nothing in the dissents of Blakely itself that says taking Apprendi as the law, we can distinguish it from the facts in this case. There was nothing of that in the dissents.",
  "I think the Stringer test is helpful because there, of course, this Court said that one of its prior decisions was not a new rule, because even though there was a different State sentencing system that slightly different before the Court in the subsequent case, the principle from the prior case dictated only one result. And I think once you go back to the dissents in Blakely and compare them let's say, with the dissents in Booker, on the merits that is, in Booker, I think again it is telling, because the dissenters in Blakely had nothing to say in terms of a possible way to distinguish one case from the other; whereas in Booker, the dissents did point out we don't have to extend it this far. We can limit to it to true statutes and not go this far. So there is a difference. Really what this case, I think one way to phrase it in terms of what it comes down to, is whether when this Court lays a decision down like Apprendi, that has a clear rule and lots of historical, robust reasoning behind it, saying why we are adopting a certain rule, whether it is up to the lower courts, in this case the State courts, to second-guess this Court and say I don't know if the Court really means what it says, as Justice Breyer later put it in the Blakely dissent. We think that, we submit what this Court should say is that when we say something is the law, that lower courts ought to assume that's the law, at least until we tell them somehow that the law is different. If there are no more questions on the new rule, I will quickly address the watershed argument. Because if for some reason this Court adopted the state's view that really all Apprendi was was a highly formalistic rule about what is a statutory maximum, and that -- and that just simply labeling, courts could have evaded it, we think that Blakely itself then has to be considered a watershed exception -- a watershed rule. And the reason why is because, is because of an error that runs throughout the state's brief. And the state's position is basically that this can't be watershed because Apprendi and Blakely deal with circumstances where a defendant has already been convicted of a crime and all we're considering is what sentence ought to be imposed. But, of course, that -- that contravenes the very holding of Apprendi and Blakely which is to remedy the fact that the defendant is being sentenced for a greater crime than the jury actually found him guilty of. And - -",
  "I think that's right, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "In the watershed realm?",
  "If this Court concluded in the Whorton case that watershed did not survive AEDPA, then of course you're right, watershed doesn't -- can't get us home here. But as this case comes to the Court, as I understand it, this Court is considering this case in a posture that it really dealt with in Horn versus Banks where it said that even post AEDPA, what a court is supposed to do is conduct what this Court termed a threshold Teague inquiry as to whether Teague is satisfied. And of course in Horn, this Court mentioned the watershed exception itself. So we think that what this Court should really do is address that threshold question to the extent it needs to holistically. If there are no more questions, I'll reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Let me say one word on jurisdiction and then turn to two comments on the merits. On jurisdiction, I think Mr. Roberts is right that this rarely happens in the Federal system. It rarely happens in the State system. We can't find any other case where a petitioner has gone in naming, as the State would say, in effect the wrong judgment and saying: \"I'm challenging this judgment.\" But what happened here was just that. Mr. Burton went in and said he was challenging the 1994 judgment. And under this Court's Castro decision, when a pro se petitioner comes in and says I'm doing one thing, in that case making a motion for a new trial, it can't be converted into something else which is a first habeas petition without advising the petitioner. And here, not only was he not advised by the trial court but the State in its own answer, which we attached to our reply brief, agreed that he could challenge the 1994 conviction, and said that conviction is final, and he can challenge that judgment, the 1994 judgment. So it's way too late in the day for the State to stand up to you now and say this pro se petitioner should bear the burden of bringing an improper petition. On the merits, I don't want to elaborate beyond simply just telling this Court that if you look at the Hughes decision and you look at the Washington decision from the Washington state courts, it is clear that an extra finding was necessary here, even if the only aggravator in play is the free crimes are clearly too lenient factor. Hughes makes it crystal clear that a judge needs to find, and I'm quoting, \"extraordinarily serious harm or culpability arising from the multiple offenses.\" And to the extent that the State stands before you now and quotes from parts of Mr. Burton's case where the trial judge did not explicitly make that finding, that only reinforces the strength of his habeas petition now, that under Washington state law, the judge needed to make that kind of an extra finding and the judge didn't do so. Let me finally turn to a discussion about whether this Court's treatment of Walton and Apprendi could have given a State judge a reasonable basis to distinguish the system at issue in Blakely. We don't think it could because this Court didn't simply say in Apprendi that Walton stands. It explicitly said the reason why the Arizona capital system as we understand it is okay is because it's nothing more than a system that is permissible under Williams against New York. It's one where on the basis of the jury's finding of guilt that the death penalty is permissible without anything else. And so the only disagreement between the majority and Justice O'Connor's dissent was as to the way Arizona's system worked, but any judge that would have looked at Apprendi would have seen, the majority is telling us that a system is okay so long as the jury verdict itself allows the ultimate sentence. That is exactly the kind of system that was not in place in Washington, so a judge should have full well realized. And of course as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, once it became clear to this Court the way that Arizona's capital sentencing system functioned, this Court had little difficulty simply applying the Apprendi rule and agreeing that that system had to be invalid too. And just like the Blakely decision itself, not even the dissenters suggested that Apprendi dictated otherwise. If this Court has no further questions, I'll submit the case.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There is no evidence in the record of any kind suggesting that 400,000 people in Indiana lack this form of identification. The only evidence in the record - -",
  "We've never had a problem. In fact, that data was submitted by the plaintiffs. It came from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and was matched against census data. I don't think there's ever been any dispute about the accuracy of the record. Now, the judge did acknowledge that there might be some outliers one direction or another, but those cannot possibly account for 10 times the number.",
  "Well, I think we would say that that's the number -- that's the number that could conceivably be inconvenienced by this law. Now, to put that in perspective, I think you have to compare it, for example, to the number of people who are not registered to vote, because there again that's an incidental burden. That is something that inconveniences some people. And we're talking about 35 times more -- in terms of a percentage, we're talking about 66.8 percent or so of the population that reports being registered to vote, far short of the percentage based on the calculations of the district court or anything in the ballpark of that that don't have photo identification. So we're talking about an infinitesimal portion of the electorate that could even be, conceivably be burdened by this.",
  "And at that level, you're talking about less than a half a percent of the total electorate. This is -- this is - -",
  "Well, if that's going to be the case, then you're going to have a big problem with voter registration, which is a far bigger problem for more voters. That is a procedure that the Court has long accepted, has endorsed multiple times, and yet continues --",
  "The point I'm making is that if we're going to look at the percent conceivably burdened by the law, then voter registration is called into question. And I don't think that the Democratic Party argues against that. I think in their reply brief they accepted that that's a possible response. Now, it's also terribly significant that we don't have anybody in front of this Court in this case who's injured by this law.",
  "I agree with that. I don't think that that -- that we take any issue with that notion.",
  "None. I think that that's exactly the point. That's why we argue there's no standing.",
  "Well, I'm not sure that's the case. And if you look back at Marston, the voter registration - -",
  "Well, I hope not. But I think that the Court has shown - -",
  "Right.",
  "I'm not sure that that's terribly significant, because if you have an as-applied challenge - -",
  "As to an as-applied challenge? I don't know why not.",
  "I think it could be pre-enforcement and as-applied in a way that could have ultimately - -",

  "Right.",
  "No.",
  "I think that's right.",
  "I should hope not.",
  "That's right.",
  "With respect, Your Honor, for all we know, those may have been fraudulent ballots. It may well be the case that all 32 did not show up to validate their votes are fraudulent.",
  "And that goes back to how we would know, because without an ID check, it's impossible to detect this kind of fraud.",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "Well, because I think we want to have an idea that has some integrity to it. I mean, this is a balancing test that the legislature itself went through, which is to say they wanted to adopt a form of identification that might be effective and has been proven effective and has been accepted the world over as the standard form of identification. And - -",
  "I think again that we, on the front end part of it is we are hamstrung on how we can regulate voter registration, in part by the National Voter Registration Act. Let me just make that part of it clear.",
  "I think in part it's the administrative apparatus. I mean, we are buying into - - right now into a system that already exists, and in fact with voter registration at the DMV as it's required, in many ways that is what you have. You go to the DMV anyway for other things.",
  "No, we don't. That's right.",
  "I think there are problems with that. That -- that was a different battle - -",
  "No. I think that's the main point here, which is it's at that point where the ballot is being cast, which is where we want identification, and where we want to - -",
  "Well, we -- well, I think we may very well, but I think the policy - -",
  "Well, I think the policy struck nationally, under the motor voter, is to have an easy registration system, so that it may be problematic to introduce additional limits.",
  "Well, I think the theory is easy - -",
  "Well, and tough to cheat, hopefully, is the backside of that, which is what the idea is trying to do.",
  "Well, I think that -- that part of the responsibility there does lie again with the National Voter Registration Act which limits how we may maintain those lists. The problem has grown since - -",
  "There may be -- there's part of it is the responsibility on our end, but part of it is also the -- the hoops we have to jump through pursuant to the National Voter Registration Act, and we've got a situation unfortunately where with inflated voter lists, with reports of fraud around the country, the General Assembly is generally concerned about voter confidence and the legitimacy of elections, and that's precisely what this law is trying to target. Trying to reassure voters - -",
  "We are among the most inflated. I can't give you precise ranking but the expert that we brought forward said we are among the most inflated.",
  "That's right, and we are taking those steps. Now I think it's important to bear in mind that -- that the parties to the consent decree at the State level, while they can't identify individuals who have -- have dormant registrations, and they can send those names, names that can be canceled to the local authorities, the local authorities are under no -- no responsibility under the consent decree or otherwise to -- to cancel those. And in fact the expert report that we had indicated that there were a number -- in 1998, I think -- a number of duplicates and decedent registrations that were sent to the local authorities, only 30 percent of which were canceled.",
  "Well, I think it's part of it, is - -",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, I think the larger point is that when we've got a situation where there is an obvious gap in security at the polls, where the public expects to show ID -- and -- as they would in any ordinary, everyday situation -- that is going to create a lack of confidence, particularly when combined with what we have ended up with.",
  "Not explicitly. That is true; that's part of the argument, but the other part is that there is a reasonable and obvious step to take to ensure that there is no fraud at the polls.",
  "Well, we are limited even at that by the NVRA.",
  "No, I'm not saying that, but I am saying - -",
  "Consistent with the NVRA, yes.",
  "No, not at all.",
  "No, that's not my theory. But - -",
  "Who -- right, and who would have to pay a fee to get -- to get the ID.",
  "Well, that's right. Anybody who - -",
  "Well, and who can also vote absentee without ID. But anybody who forgets their identification on election day, for example, would have to go through the same process, where they would cast a provisional ballot and then have to return to the clerk with in 10 days.",
  "Or a nonindigent person who doesn't have ID but then needs to go to the DMV.",
  "Well, let me do point out one category where there are some reasonable alternatives. With respect -- in Indiana -- with respect to the elderly who can swear that they were never issued a birth certificate, there is an alternate means of identification, but that's the only category. The other thing we run into is the REAL ID Act. If Indiana wants to have an identification card that can be acceptable in Federal facilities, it's going to have to have minimal criteria for issuing those photo identifications. And so I think with respect to that, it would not be permissible to get around a birth certificate, which is kind of a foundational document. I mean there are alternatives, such as a passport, but I don't -- you know, I don't mean to suggest that that's necessarily going to be easier than it is to get a birth certificate. It's just that - -",
  "Well, that's what I mean.",
  "Yes. And it -- it's worth bearing in mind that this form of identification is necessary to do so many everyday activities, and it's not as if the State of Indiana went out and created an entirely new system to impose on the entire electorate, that everybody would have to start from square one. The vast majority of voters are already in compliance with this law, and the decision of the General Assembly, that it is a reasonable step to take for a measure of election security to bring the State's voting system into the 21st century and to require the same photo identification that you have to show typically to get on an airplane, to get into many Federal courthouses, is a reasonable step in the right direction to preserve voter confidence.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Each of the three rulings at issue here rests firmly in the mainstream of American tort law. And there is no reason in maritime jurisprudence to depart from those rules. I want to start with the first question presented, what Exxon calls the vicarious liability issue. And I think it's important to frame the discussion by starting with the actual jury instruction that's at issue in this case. It's at Pet. App. 301a. It says that a managerial agent is someone who supervises other employees and has responsibility for, and authority over, particular aspects of a corporation's business. And, as Justice Ginsburg noted, Exxon has never disputed that Captain Hazelwood satisfied this definition. As its own internal documents explain, Captain Hazelwood was in charge of what they called a business unit of Exxon Shipping. He was in charge of hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment, of product; he was in charge of budgeting and personnel with respect to the vessel; he was also in charge of safety. He was the person who decided on behalf of Exxon that it was safe to leave port the night of March Now, it is our submission that it is perfectly appropriate to expose the corporation to punitive damages based on the reckless acts of such an individual. In doing so, it does not, as Exxon would contend, impose vicarious liability. Rather, what it does is it exposes a corporation to liability based on its own culpability. The very point of the restatement test, as opposed to the vicarious liability rule that is followed by the majority of the States, is that it requires some complicity on the part of the corporation.",
  "Not for punitive damages, Mr. Chief Justice. And the reason why is because the lookout does not run a business unit of Exxon Shipping. What is happening here -- and I want to focus on this for a moment because Mr. Dellinger - -",
  "That's what Exxon regarded the ship as, and so that's what the record says. And the idea is that you had - -",
  "Well, I don't want to rest primarily on labels. The idea is function. And I think, going back to the instruction, what the instruction is asking the jury to determine is: Is this a person who has authority over an aspect of a corporation's business? I think a shorthand for that is in Exxon's own documents that it is - -",
  "Well, I think the authority - -",
  "There are about 20 vessels like the Valdez.",
  "Now, I think Mr. Chief Justice had it right when he said it's no answer to say it can't be the master; it has to be the corporation. The corporation can only act through people. So there has to be a line drawing that takes place. Now, this notion of the idea that the master isn't good enough because he had to be a policymaker is new to us.",
  "He may not be. I don't think the question is whether he's responsible for policy. Again, it's whether he's the person in charge. What Exxon during instruction to the district court asked the jury to be required to find is that there was a shore-based supervisory official of the Exxon defendants who made the decision. So Exxon itself recognized that you have to draw the line somewhere. We think the best place to draw the line, and the conservative place to law, the line is the managerial-agent rule that's in the Restatement. Now, Mr. Dellinger says there are eight States that follow a different rule. And it's important to understand that that's not the case. Even among the States that follow the Lake Shore formulation in general, you still have to have a way to implement it. It's not -- the idea is if the corporation has to be complicit, you still have to tell the jury which human beings they can look to for that complicity. So at page 33 of our red brief - -",
  "There was no captain at issue in Amiable Nancy. And, Of course, there wasn't a captain at issue in Lake Shore, because it was a land-based case. But on page 33 of our red brief we've given you seven -- several States that say we follow the complicity test, and here's how you do it. You require the jury to find that the person is at least a managerial agent. Exxon itself in its reply brief on page - - page 11, footnote 5, cites several States. And I gather these are the States to which Mr. Dellinger is referring when he says there are eight States that follow our rule. Well, we did some research after getting the reply brief, and I want to give you a few cites, because it illustrates the principle yet again. Several of those States say we follow the Lake Shore complicity idea. And, therefore, the way we do it is we require a jury to find at least a managerial agent. So Kansas is a State that Exxon cites. In the Flint Hills case at 941 P.2d 374, Kansas says the way in modern times you implement Lake Shore is you require a managerial agent. In Connecticut, the Stoltz case 867 A.2d 860, and in the D.C. Circuit, Justice Scalia, they quote one of your opinions. If you look at D.C. law, the D.C. Court of Appeals itself and a D.C. circuit in another case have said -- and this is the Arthur Young case, 631 A.2d 354, and the GMAC case at 273 F.2d 92 - -",
  "No State tort case that we're aware of, Justice Kennedy, adopts -- I think what you're referring to is the Kolstad policy exception.",
  "Well, I think I want to say two things. The first is that, as I understand it, Exxon has conceded across the board that Captain Hazelwood is a managerial agent. And in this case -- in this Court's own Kolstad case, if you look at it again, it says Amiable Nancy, Lake Shore and the way you implement that - -",
  "Well, if you were to adopt a rule that no other State has adopted, which is to say there was a policy defense in ordinary tort cases, which unlike Kolstad do not rest on the subjective knowledge of the actor, even then, we submit, we tried that issue in this case, Justice Kennedy; and there was -- Exxon had every opportunity to argue policy. In its closing argument to the jury, the only policy it mentioned was the policy of two officers on the bridge while transporting - -",
  "That's right, Justice Kennedy. We think that's the proper rule of law.",
  "Well, I don't want to act like a dog chasing his tail here, Justice Kennedy, but the idea is to ask whether the corporation is culpable, you have to ask which people. And what happened in this Court's own decision in Kolstad said in implementing Lake Shore that you look to the managerial agents. And that's what - -",
  "Three reasons, Justice Breyer. The first is with all due respect, Amiable Nancy did not involve the wrongdoing of the captain. It involved the wrongdoing of a lower officer on the ship; and so it's -- there's nothing in the Amiable Nancy that deals with captains, so you don't have a stare decisis effect that comes from Amiable Nancy with respect to captains. The second thing is there are some more recent Federal cases that discuss the Lake Shore managerial agent idea. We've cited them in our -- in our red brief along through -- I'm flipping now -- but there are RICO cases; there are other cases, and Mr. Dellinger said, where statutory case -- statutory regimes need to be implemented. And we have cited several lower court decisions that look to the managerial agent rule to do that, none of this Court. The third thing is to understand, as you talked about in Lake Shore, you are having to pick somebody, and the general idea is higher up is okay, and way down low is not okay. Fletcher in his Cyclopedia on corporations says that if the Lake Shore idea is to make sense today, you have to understand that when you're dealing with humongous corporations, you have to look not just to the president or vice president -- and this is what the D.C. Circuit said in the GMAC case as well -- is that when you deal with multinational corporations with tens of thousands of employees and divisions, you look to -- you look a little bit lower down than those top job titles to managers. And so again this is what Professor Schoenbaum says in his amicus brief to this Court dealing with that from a maritime perspective.",
  "No, it would not be, Mr. Chief Justice. What we did - -",
  "What we did our reply brief - - I'm sorry, what we did in our red brief is cite to Professor Robertson's article in saying that he collected the cases, and which he did; and so our best cases are the City of Carlisle case, the Ludlow and Ralston against States Rights is very close. There's a distinction in Ralston versus exemplary - -",
  "We don't think that's the right reading of the case. We submit -- we have a footnote in our own brief that says that there are only two cases that they cite in which a captain's conduct is not imputed to the ship's owner. They are both more than 100 years old, and neither of them deal with corporations. So I think it is entirely fair to say that you have more or less an open issue before you today. What I think I want to be sure the Court understands, though, is that there is not a stare decisis problem that this Court has to confront with respect to the first question. You have a spattering of a few old cases that lean in different directions.",
  "Pardon me?",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, because neither Amiable Nancy nor the Lake Shore case, which are the only two cases from this Court, dealt with a managerial agent. The more recent cases from this Court, Hydrolevel and Kolstad -- Hydrolevel says any agent for treble damages for antitrust, and Kolstad follows the managerial agent principle, following in the natural evolution of Amiable Nancy and Lake Shore. So I don't think this Court has ever considered it to be any stare decisis problem, even if all of the lower courts were lined up against it, which is far from the -- far from the case here. What you have is a just few lower courts in either correction. I gather that's one of the reasons why this Court decided to grant certiorari in this case, because there's some dispute among the lower courts as to exactly how this principle works in maritime law. But again, we don't think there's any problem with this Court - -",
  "I said one of the reasons, Justice Scalia.",
  "Kolstad starts from the proposition of managerial agent is the proper way to implement a complicity rule. There's a second part of Kolstad that says we have to change what we think is the ordinary common law rule, the proper Federal common law rule. We have to change it in the context of Title VII because of the unusual situation in which employers can be held liable based on the subjective knowledge of the wrongdoer; and tort law is exactly the opposite. It is an objective test. And so there's no worry in imposing punitive damages here, that you're going to -- that you're going to dissuade an employer from training its employees. Now, on the facts, even if you were to agree with me on that legal argument, you're exactly right on the facts, Justice Ginsburg. Exxon had a paper alcohol policy that prohibited drinking aboard ship, just like the Coast Guard has a policy to that effect. But the evidence in this case was that Exxon didn't enforce it.",
  "On the - -",
  "On the first part of the case in phase one that was our -- that was the legal theory, Justice -- you're right, Justice Kennedy. But in phase three of the trial when a jury decided whether to award punitive damages, the instructions told it, among other things -- this is instruction 30 in phase three -- it told among other things to consider whether or not the wrongdoers were violating company policy.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Well, I -- I accept that, and I think I've explained that by distinguishing an ordinary tort case from the situation in Title VII. I think it's instructive for this Court, and we agree with Exxon that when this Court sits as a maritime court, it looks for guidance to what other State courts have done. And we think it's instructive that not one single State court, either before or after Kolstad, has adopted a policy defense for defendants. There's simply no such decision on the books outside of discrimination cases. We think - -",
  "In a tort case, Your Honor?",
  "Yes. We think -- and that's - - and that's what instruction Justice Kennedy - -",
  "Well, it can hire fit and competent people who it decides - -",
  "Well - -",
  "Apart from adopting a policy, they need to implement it soundly. And the argument you're making, if I understand it correctly, would obtain just as easily if the vice president of Exxon Corporation or the president of Exxon Shipping, whom Mr. Dellinger says would put Exxon on the hook, had made the decision to put Joe Hazelwood in command of this ship. And so you always have the problem - -",
  "Well, in some -- I think in some respects we're back to the argument of where you draw the line. But let's look at the conduct in this case. Who made the decision that it was safe to depart port that night on behalf of Exxon Corporation? Captain Hazelwood. The record unequivocally says that Captain Hazelwood is the one who made that policy decision.",
  "I don't think so.",
  "I think that's the point that I was trying to make.",
  "Well, if we're to the point where the question is whether or not the policy was enforced, we'll very happily rest on the record in this case, because that was what we tried to the jury: That there was no serious alcohol policy that was enforced. We showed 33 instances in the record of Exxon employees drinking with Hazelwood or learning that he drank. Up and down the corporation, as the district judge explained, for three years, upper management was receiving reports that this man was drinking aboard the vessel. Now, its policy, Mr. Chief Justice, was that that was not allowed. But over a three-year span, as the district judge found again and again and again, they were told there was a problem.",
  "I think you assume - -",
  "Well, two -- two points, Justice Breyer: On answering the first question presented - -",
  "-- you assume - -",
  "-- unless we can show -- unless we can make an overwhelming harmless errors - -",
  "The second and third, I think you assume the facts - -",
  "Well, I think this is the perfect segue from the first and third questions. As I transfer there, I want to point out that I think the only reason that we heard in the first -- the first portion of the argument for absolving Exxon of responsibility in the situation is because of the dangerousness of captaining vessels like this. This Court has already addressed that concern in its collision doctrine, and tort law generally addresses the problem of dangerous activities and split-second decisions. And the answer to that is they are simply not reckless when somebody makes a good-faith decision in a crisis in the midst of dangerous activity. So we don't think there's any special rule that is necessary with respect to the first question presented. Now, you asked me how do deal with it in terms of the size of the award. We think -- first of all, I think that if I can beg to differ slightly with the way you framed it, as Professor Robertson explained, punitive damages are -- have always been firmly established in maritime law. And then just because there haven't been that many cases doesn't tell you that they've been frowned upon. It just means that we haven't had that many cases that have resulted in reported decisions. Now, in looking to guidance, this Court isn't sitting as a maritime court. So it -- it's siting as a common-law-type court. We think the best place to start is with the common-law tradition, which is that cases are tried to juries; juries make the first decision; and then the trial court reviews for passion and prejudice and for substantial evidence, as our trial court did here. And then the court of appeals reviews that for abuse of discretion. If there's anything more that's necessary in maritime law, we submit Congress has already stepped into the breach with the Limitation of Liability Act.",
  "I think that's a constitutional holding. What this Court said in Cooper was if - -",
  "Yes. I'm not going to fight you on that, Justice Kennedy. There was an earlier sentence in Cooper that says if no constitutional issue is raised, the only thing an appellate court should do is review for abuse of discretion. But I think that ultimately you end up in the same place, which is that there's a de novo review of the excessive -- of whether the award is excessive based on the facts that have been -- that have been tried. And if this Court is going to adopt a set of guideposts for maritime law, we think the proper place to look is the due- process cases this Court has already decided. This Court has already -- in its due-process cases, the Court looked to the common law. That's where, I gather, the guideposts this Court adopted came from: Reprehensibility, in particular, which this Court said was the most important indicia, as well as a reasonable relationship, what's commonly referred to as the \"ratio test.\"",
  "I think I accept what you said, Justice Scalia. The third -- with respect to the size of the award, we never contested Exxon's ability to argue that the Clean Water Act is one place you can look. So, if you were to look to the Clean Water Act, you initially have the problem that Justice Souter mentioned. You have the apples and oranges problem. The Clean Water Act sets a fine cording to the environmental harm. Now, the State of Alaska had that estimated in its -- and this is in its brief -- and that came out to be -- I believe the number is about $2.6 billion. So, if you were to look -- if you were to put aside the apples and oranges problem and look to the Clean Water Act, then you get almost the number that we're standing here with today. If you look at the harm a different way, you still get an extremely large number. You get $500 million of compensation to the Plaintiffs. And then on top of that, we think in light of the way this Court has addressed ratio analysis in its other cases, you need to take account of the fact that there are vast injuries that have not resulted in any compensation. So to do any kind of - -",
  "Well, I think it would be because that's -- they never made that argument in the district court, and they didn't make that argument to the - -",
  "Well, they didn't make that argument, but if they had, I don't think it ends up being any different than their pre-emption argument because -- remember their pre-emption argument isn't a pure pre-emption argument. They're not here today saying the Plaintiffs can't recover compensatory damages, as was the case in the Milwaukee and Illinois case, for example. What they're saying is that the Clean Water Act displaces our ability to recover punitive damages. And there, by making the argument that I gather you've sketched out, it looks very much like the same argument that they didn't properly make.",
  "But it doesn't - -",
  "That's right, Justice Ginsburg. And at page 103 of the joint appendix, the district court ruled on that motion and held that TAPAA was the statute that was controlling with respect to spills of trans-Alaska oil and that the savings clause of TAPAA expressly preserved our ability to seek punitive damages. That's a ruling that, as you noted, Exxon never appealed, and so it is the law of the case.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, as I said, I agree you should look to it, but you should do it in a way this Court's Miles decision instructs. It says that Congress doesn't just enact general policies. By enacting a statute that gives some protection, Congress indicates not just a general policy, but more importantly, the sphere into which that policy is to be given effect. And so the notion that Congress did step in and give shipowners some protection but left out shipowners like Exxon that behave in the manner at issue in this case, we think is a strong - -",
  "Well, I think -- I think you should look to it and understand that Congress has declined to give the protection. In OPA 90, which was passed right after the spill in direct response to the spill, Congress made explicit that the Limitation Act should never apply to spills of Trans-Alaska oil. And the TAPAA did the same thing in the - -",
  "Well, we don't think we're asking for any kind of expansion of liability. All we're asking is for the traditional admiralty rule which has been recognized by Justice Story early on and all through the cases that in cases of reckless indifference a shipowner can be held liable for punitive damages. The only thing - -",
  "Well, I think it would -- I'll stick with unwise, Justice Souter.",
  "And I think the reason why is because we agree with that. You should -- you should look to the experience of the States. Not one single State, as a matter of common law authority, has set a bright-line ratio. The only place - -",
  "We think that's one place this Court can look. But again, a common-law court, we believe, sets standards, not a bright-line rule. If you were to adopt some sort of bright-line statute, you'd have to deal with any number of legislative problems that the several States have dealt with and Congress, when it has passed these kinds of limits. First, you have to decide the ratio number. You have to pull something out there. Then you have to decide is it on a per capita basis in terms of -- what several States have done is they've set a limit, that a ratio only kicks in at a certain dollar amount. In this case, it's worth remembering that the plaintiffs are only standing to recover $75,000 a piece in punitive damages. Now, most States that even have caps, or several of the States at least, say they don't apply if the awards are under a $100,000 per capita.",
  "But the theory - -",
  "I think that's - -",
  "I think the theory of the States, Justice Breyer, is that if you hurt lots and lots of people, it's a worse act than if you only hurt one or two. And so if you have, as in this case, destroyed an entire regional economy, that it would be inappropriate to give some sort of credit for that by a lower ratio just because you've harmed more people. Now, there's also - -",
  "Well, I think you've looked at punishment and deterrence, Justice Kennedy. And if I could finish the last thing I want to say about looking at a ratio, several States that even have ratios carve out drunk driving cases and cases involving intoxication from any other otherwise applicable limits. And that's -- I think one reason why, Justice Kennedy, is deterrence. And so, I think let's start with deterrence, but I want to frame that discussion by recognizing that in Cooper this Court said that deterrence is not the only goal; you also look to punishment. Now, I think Exxon's primary argument on deterrence grounds is that we've paid $3.4 billion out of our pocket already as a result of this spill, and that's a lot of money. The reality is, once they get their tax credit and insurance benefits for that money, the number is really under 2 billion. But it's still a lot of money. And so I think it's important to look at the district court proceedings involving the Clean Water Act, involving the criminal prosecution here, and ask whether it makes sense to have Exxon pay additional money in punitive damages. We think it is. The first thing to understand is that the same district judge that saw the criminal proceedings in this case sat over our trial. He understood what the criminal case was about, and what it was about was the environment. That was only thing on the table in the criminal case. And so, when we tried to argue - -",
  "There was no jury, of course, in the criminal case.",
  "But there was a jury in our case. The district judge reviewed that and said, after being instructed in instruction number 36 in our case - - and this is something that we tried -- the chairman of Exxon took the stand in trial and gave the jury a chart of all the money that Exxon had paid out of its pocket and told the jury: We've been deterred enough, so you shouldn't award any punitive damages. And the jury, of course, rejected that argument that Exxon made. And the district judge reviewing that decision -- and this is around page 240 to 245 of the petition appendix -- the district judge said: I think the jury had ample reason to do so. And remember to the tune of $5 billion. And so why did the district judge think that? Well - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, not when he was reviewing the size of the award, Mr. Chief Justice. In the criminal case, the statement of facts supporting the guilty plea in the criminal case -- and remember, we're only talking about environment in the criminal case -- and in terms of punishment, the only money for punishment in the criminal case is $25 million. All the rest of the money is, as the district court said, to clean up Exxon's mess or to put money into the environment. Now, for $25 million fine that Exxon paid in the criminal case, the district judge explained -- or I'm sorry, the district judge approved the statement that the U.S. attorney submitted, which said the basis for this is that the captain and the third mate were negligent. That was the only thing even there. It wasn't until our trial and our discovery that it was brought out that the complicity of the organization ran far deeper. And so at our -- phase three of our trial, which was entirely about Exxon's conduct, not any more at all about Captain Hazelwood's conduct -- in phase three of our trial we started out the closing argument by saying here's the relevant evidence for the jury. And we played something for the jury called Trial Compilation 9. Now, that appears at appears at page 1295 of the joint appendix, and we actually submitted a videotape that we have submitted to the Clerk's office, and it is sitting in the Clerk's office. There are 50 segments in Trial Compilation 9, and all 50 deal with Exxon's upper management receiving reports of Hazelwood's conduct and deeming it a gross error to put him in command and so forth, all there. So it wasn't until the trial in our case that it came out how deep the complicity ran in the organization and how reprehensible the conduct was. And in reviewing the award the district judge said: Now, with that level of complicity and reprehensibility, I think the jury could have decided that Exxon should be punished for this - -",
  "-- occurrence.",
  "We submit that - -",
  "The district judge said that this is what he deemed a critical factor supporting the punitive award.",
  "No. If you accept our argument in the first that to get in the door, all we had to show was that a managerial agent was reckless and that Captain Hazelwood, as Exxon conceded, Was a managerial agent. When you are reviewing the size of the award - - and I think we're talking about the third question presented, the size of the award -- all the -- all the evidentiary questions are resolved in favor of us, and certainly they are resolved in a way that conducting de novo reviews, a lower court understood and told this Court what the record was. And it is all about the three years that they knew Captain Hazelwood was drinking. But I don't want to leave Justice Kennedy's question about deterrence, because even if this Court looks at the payments Exxon has made from a perspective of deterrence, there are two legs in which Exxon has clearly not been deterred. The first is that Exxon's own executives testified to Congress shortly after the spill that the results of the spill were, quote, \"pretty much as we envisioned.\" Now, it was also common knowledge in the organization, and this came out at trial, that the idea of putting a drunken master in charge of a supertanker was a potential for disaster and incalculably raised the chances of a disaster and a catastrophic spill occurring. Knowing all this; knowing what could happen; knowing that the industry did not have sufficient cleanup equipment to contain a big spill; knowing that tens of thousands of Alaskans that depended on Exxon taking proactive action, the kind of action that Congress had demanded in passing the TAPAA; Exxon nonetheless left Captain Hazelwood in command over a three-year span. So it wasn't deterred by knowing what would happen if the tanker ran aground. Even if you look at it from the perspective of having paid the money out of its pocket, what did it do? It still hadn't been deterred. In the wake of the spill, and this is part of Trial Compilation 9, and this was part of the argument to the jury, Exxon fired one person -- Captain Hazelwood. They reassigned the third mate. Everybody else up -- further up the chain of command who allowed this to happen received bonuses and raises. They have taken no action inside the company to express in any meaningful way that they've been deterred by what happened in this incident - -",
  "-- and the amount of money that they've had to pay.",
  "By definition, Justice Ginsburg, this is a mandatory punitive class, so this is the one and only time Exxon will face the respect of punitive damages.",
  "Right. One of the many ways in which this case is the mirror image of the due process cases that Justice Souter was referring to that caused this Court to have such great concern about the uptick in punitive damages, here you have a single case. You have a single digit ratio which is proportionate to the harm that was shown in this case. You have -- in contrast to State Farm, in the most recent -- second most recent case this case had -- in State Farm you had two plaintiffs who stood before this Court having received $500,000 each in compensatory damages for the emotional distress of 18 months of not knowing whether an insurance claim was going to be paid. What you have today are 32,000 plaintiffs standing before this Court, each of whom have received only $15,000 for having their lives and livelihood destroyed and haven't received a dime of emotional distress damages. If there are no further questions, I'll submit.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The rule of lenity requires that any penal statute the government seeks to enforce against an individual must clearly and unambiguous apply to him and, as the government acknowledges its brief in this case, this Court has applied the rule of lenity in numerous recent cases involving mandatory sentencing provisions. A reaffirmation of that time-honored principle is all that is necessary to decide this case. The 20-year mandatory - -",
  "Well, the rule of lenity has been - -",
  "As to sentencing? No, in the mid-20th century, Justice Kennedy, in the Bell decision written by Justice Frankfurter and in Ladner, both involved the degree of punishment which the defendant would receive. There are other cases: In 1980 the Simpson case, and Bifulco around the same time. So this Court has a history of applying the rule of lenity with equal force to sentencing provisions as it does to statutes demarcating criminal conduct or not. And of course, as the green brief specially highlights, the very essence and the core of the rule of lenity derives from the English common law, which is -- which was designed to invoke the rule of lenity to avoid mandatory punishment, not -- not so much whether conduct was criminal or not. So we think that applying that rule in a straightforward manner to this case requires a reversal. The 20-year mandatory minimum in Section 841(b)(1)(A) applies only to defendants who have a prior conviction for a, quote, \"felony drug offense.\" Now, a sensible reading of that provision is that a State law misdemeanor simply does not constitute a felony drug offense.",
  "That's right, Mr. Chief Justice, and if that's all you had on the statute books this might be an easier case. But as you know, I think, above section 44 and section 13 the term \"felony\" is described and defined as \"a crime that is classified as a felony under Federal or State law.\" And so when you start with section 841(b)(1)(A), which uses the term \"felony drug offense,\" and you go to the definitional section, the first thing you come to is the definition of felony, which says a crime classified as such. And then, as you say, in section 44 you reach another definition. So we think that at the very least you have an ambiguity here in which Congress has given two facially applicable definitions to the operative provision of the statute.",
  "Well, in a sense it's our position that both are at issue here. The term \"felony,\" which is within the term \"felony drug offense,\" is also at issue here. And as we've pointed out in pages 11 and 12, 11 and 12 of our yellow brief, it's not uncommon for Congress to have two separate definitions one of which is a single term within a broader term in a statute. And so the mere fact, as the government would argue, that the word \"felony\" is not repeated in the definition of subsection 44 does not mean that Congress meant that to be the sole definition. We've given three examples on pages 11 and 12 where the sensible reading of the statute is that Congress attempted to nest the definition of a single term within the definition of a broader term.",
  "I think there is an agreement between us and the government on this point. We cite in our blue brief statutes from Arizona as well as a couple of other States where there are crimes that are classified as felonies but punishable in less than a year. And in those cases we agree with the government that that is the effect of the 1994 conforming amendments, is to exclude those outlier States that take low-level crimes and nonetheless classify them as felonies. What this case is about - -",
  "Well, that works on the language of the statute, Justice Alito.",
  "Well, I think it is quite plausible that the language that Congress added has very little practical effect. And that flows from the fact that Congress called these nothing more than conforming amendments, so Congress apparently wasn't trying to accomplish any dramatic change here and I think it might help to understand by looking at the other outlier states that the government claims got swept in with the 1994 amendments. We cite statutes from States like Colorado. Perhaps if I used a concrete example. Take possession of a single ounce of marijuana. That is one of the crimes in Arizona that we were just talking about, that is a felony punishable by no more than a year. There are a few other States who are outliers in a different sense, in which they call these crimes misdemeanors, like the vast majority of States, but make them punishable by 18 months or more. And so what the government's position is is that in 1994 when Congress passed a conforming amendment to exclude a couple of outlier States like Arizona, it was trying to sweep in for the first time into section 841(b)(1)(A) outlier States like Colorado that treat low-level drug crimes, low-level drug possession crimes, as misdemeanors that are punishable by more than a year. So we think, for the very reasons the government explains, that Congress is trying to avoid disuniformity and happenstance according to how a few local jurisdictions might treat certain drug crimes, that it makes sense to read the '94 conforming amendments as requiring both the one-year punishment rule and the felony classification requirement. And if you have any doubt on that, we submit it really makes sense to remember that what we're what talking about here is a mandatory minimum. And so - -",
  "Well, we've cited a case in our brief in the Second Circuit that deals with that exact problem, at least with the New Jersey problem. And what the courts did and what they have done in other circumstances where there's a felony classification requirement is they simply take the crime in New Jersey and analogize it to a comparable Federal or local State crime, and if it was -- if it would be classified as a felony in that local jurisdiction, then courts -- and this is even before the 1994 amendments -- courts have treated it as a felony.",
  "I believe, Justice Alito, this was a case before 1994, so that's - -",
  "Right, because that is the Federal definition of a felony, and so that was the analogy that the Second Circuit was able to draw here and reach what we think is a commonsense way to deal with the unusual problem of New Jersey. Another - -",
  "All three of them do, Justice Scalia.",
  "They're pages 11 and 12 of the yellow brief. And so the first place to start is looking at the bottom of page 11, where the term \"employee\" is defined in one provision of the Federal - - of the Federal statutory code. And then the terms \"employee of the Capitol Police,\" \"employee of the House of Representatives\" are also defined, and they're defined -- and those broader definitions are in the footnote at the bottom of page 12. And so you see that there, after having defined the term \"employee,\" the word \"employee\" is not repeated in those definitions. They talk about \"a member\" or \"an officer\" or \"an individual.\" And so it's much like the circumstance here, where a more generic term is used in the broader definition, but it makes sense to read in the original definition. The same thing I think you can see in the middle of page 12 with the part of the Bankruptcy Code that we've given this Court. The word \"debtor\" is defined in a certain way, and then later on in the definitional provision, the term \"debtor's principal residence\" is defined as \"a residential structure\" and such and such. Again the word \"debtor\" is not repeated in the broader definition, but we think the only way to make sense of it is to import the definition of the single term into the broader term. If Congress had wanted - -",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, there might be, you know, a very rigid plain-text argument that might be made. The point is that Congress used -- defined the term \"debtor's principal residence\" without using the term \"debtor\" again and defined it somewhere else. My - -",
  "Well, then I think I'd refer you back to the employee example. I mean, no example is going to be exactly on all fours. I'm happy to acknowledge that. The idea that I'm trying to get across is it's not unusual for Congress to define single terms that are nested within larger terms.",
  "I think that's right. And I think one way to - -",
  "Okay. I think one way to understand how this statute -- if Congress had wanted to do what the government says it wanted to do, how Congress could have made it absolutely clear -- while we have the yellow brief open, we can look at page 13.",
  "For a time, yes, Justice Ginsburg, but -- so when the statute was originally passed, 802(13) was the sole definition of \"felony,\" and then somewhere along the line between the original enactment and the '94 amendments, a definition of \"felony drug offense\" was put into 841(b)(1)(A) - -",
  "-- but that itself just used the word \"felony,\" which again referred the reader back to 802(13). So, again, I think there is an agreement between - -",
  "Are you looking, Justice Ginsburg, at the 1988 version of the statute?",
  "No, because - -",
  "Oh, this is at 13a of the blue brief, Justice Scalia. So, at page 13a it says, \"For purposes of this subparagraph, the term 'felony drug offense' means an offense that is a felony under any provision of this subchapter, under any Federal law.\" Now, the word \"felony\" again would have referred the reader back to 802(13). If I understand - -",
  "Right. But I think, again, the word \"felony\" as it appears in -- in that provision - - and I think that the government agrees with us on this -- would have referred the reader back to 802(13) as of",
  "-- because there isn't the explicit classification requirement.",
  "Well, I think the latter language, Justice Ginsburg, is defining - -",
  "-- \"drug offense,\" whereas the word \"felony\" I think is not a self-defining term in that statute as it's written. And to understand whether we're talking about something like a one-year rule or a classification requirement, the reader needs to go back to the definitional section.",
  "As of 1988?",
  "Well, it says \"a felony under the law of a State.\" So I think the classification requirement -- I don't think it's inconsistent with it. It might clarify it.",
  "That's right, Justice Scalia.",
  "Well, I guess you could, but then you wouldn't have a definition; then you'd have to figure out how to define \"felony,\" whether it was a classification or a one-year rule or something else. I think the natural reading, again, would be a classification requirement to the extent to which you couldn't look further than that provision of the statute, but - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, we don't disagree with the government that the one-year rule does serve the purpose of helping iron out - -",
  "Well, I think, Justice Breyer, with due respect, if you look at the way different States treat drug crimes - -",
  "That's what I'm trying to respond -- different States treat drug crimes dramatically different, and this is so -- I think it's common sense that States treat different crimes -- treat -- different States punish the same crime differently. And that's nowhere more true than in drug crime, because there's a great amount of experimentation that goes on in the States. And one of the things that certain States do, like Colorado, is take very low-level drug crimes and punish them by more than a year, in part so they can give treatment and keep people in, prison, long enough to have treatment take hold, whereas some other States treat drug crimes very differently. So you have a patchwork whether you look to the classification or whether you look to the one-year rule. That's why we think it makes sense to use both. Now, if Congress had wanted to do what the government is suggesting, which is have the one-year rule be the sole and exclusive way of determining whether you have a felony before you, it could have very easily said so. And there's an example -- and this is at page 13 of the yellow brief -- of what -- of what the Federal Sentencing Guidelines do. They define -- in a \"career-offender provision\" there is a definition of \"felony\" there that is quite explicit. They say a \"felony\" is \"an offense punishable by more than a year, regardless of whether such an offense is specifically designated as a 'felony.'\" So there are other provisions where Congress could have looked and it would have been well aware of how to make absolutely plain what it was trying to accomplish in the statute. Now, we don't think that the government's reading is implausible, Justice Breyer, for the reason --.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, I'm quoting the Sentencing Guideline, although in the Armed Career Criminal Act you can find another place where Congress dealt with this problem explicitly. It said that felonies are crimes punishable more than a year; however, if the State classifies the crime as a misdemeanor, it has to be punishable by more than two years.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, with the problem - -",
  "Not necessarily, but leaving that clause - -",
  "Well, our position is, Justice Scalia, that, standing alone, I will grant you; but the problem as we see it in this case is that that is left out. In a very common problem, how to define a felony, they leave out that explicit statement of whether classification is important. And what is more, in the same definitional provision - -",
  "Well, I think there's a good reason why Congress put it in, and that's because it is a continually vexing problem, how to define what is a felony. That's why Congress did it explicitly in the Armed Career Criminal Act. That's why the Sentencing Guidelines are explicit here. And leaving that out, and against the backdrop of a statute where the classification rule was the controlling rule for over a decade, and where they leave that classification rule in the very same definitional provision of the statute, we think, gives rise to an ambiguity.",
  "Well, I'm not sure I follow the question.",
  "Well, with all due respect, what Congress did is they left 802(13) on the books, which does turn on classifications. And it's not - - even though it is a -- it is something of a patchwork, it is not unusual at all to have very serious consequences turn on whether something is classified as a \"felony\" or not.",
  "Well, again, Justice Ginsburg, I think that is right. But then what Congress could have done is use the language that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines use, or something comparable to make clear its intent. And the classification of a felony or not a felony, as this Court knows, has a time-honored import. Things like the right to vote, the right to bear arms, the right to various civil rights turn on whether somebody has been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor. And, again, this brings us in a sense back to the rule of lenity because one of the principal reasons for the rule of lenity is fair notice. Now, this Court, as early as the McBoyle decision recognized that we're dealing with something of a fiction when we imagine an offender is looking at the statutory books to decide whether certain conduct is prohibited or not. But in the context of recidivist enhancements that lead to mandatory minimums, we're talking about very real and serious notice problems. Imagine the conscientious public defender advising someone like Mr. Burgess as to whether he should plead guilty to a misdemeanor or a felony. This happens in States across the country that have three-strike provisions, that have very serious immigration consequences turning on \"felony\" or \"misdemeanor.\" That lawyer might have concluded, as the District of Columbia Circuit did, that pleading to a misdemeanor here would not expose Mr. Burgess in the event he was convicted of a later crime to such a serious punishment as the 20-year mandatory minimum in this case.",
  "Mr. Burgess's crime, possession of cocaine, was punishable by up to two years. So, yes, he received a sentence far less than that.",
  "Yes. The crime to which he pled guilty was punishable by two years. But you should understand that that kind of hypothetical, punishable-by problem is one I know this Court dealt with a couple of months ago in the Rodriguez case. And you should understand that not just what Congress, under the government's view, had been looking to sweep in outlier States like Colorado, but if the government prevails in the Rodriguez case where the term \"punishable by\" turns on recidivist enhancements, then the 1994 amendments, which were termed \"conforming amendments,\" have an even far more sweeping effect and bring in lots of State-law misdemeanors that were never covered by the prior act. If there are no more questions, I will reserve my time.",
  "No. But I said earlier, Justice Ginsburg, giving the example of possession of one ounce of marijuana, that the vast majority of States punished that as a misdemeanor by less than a year. Mr. Burgess's crime, at best, was a misdemeanor punishable by less than a year under Federal law, but different States treat that crime differently. And I think a majority of those, a majority of States, would treat that as a crime punishable by more than a year and classified as a \"felony. If there are no more questions - -",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. If I might pick up where Justice Kennedy left off with the rule of lenity, because we don't want this Court to lose sight of the importance of the rule of lenity in this case. It's not our position that the government's reading is unreasonable. It is simply our position that our reading of the statute is a possible one and that Congress may have been - -",
  "I think, Justice Kennedy, a fair way to ask yourself the question is, would the statute here rise to the level of a plain statement of a kind that is required to, for example, abrogate sovereign immunity or to realign the Federal State balance. The term \"clear statement\" and \"clear and definition statement\" that is used in the historical context - -",
  "With all due respect, Justice Scalia, that's what the historical cases say.",
  "Yes. With all due respect. If you look at the examples in Blackstone, that's the Greenbury cite, if you look at this Court's earliest cases, Chief Justice Marshall wrote for the court in Wiltberger that even though it's extremely improbable that Congress wanted the result that the defendant presses, the Court is nevertheless going to insist on it, because it is not unambiguously clear this was Congress' intent. And so, it's easy to forget given the modern proliferation of Federal criminal statutes how rare criminal cases used to be in this court.",
  "Well, I think this is very important, Justice Scalia, your cases, especially the historical cases and the modern ones, I think, waffle in different directions, but there are plenty of cases from this Court that are much more than a tie-breaker in the sense of the rule of lenity and say, we require clear and definite terms, that's the phrase Justice Frankfurter used to repeat. Justice Holmes said the statute must be clear. Even up to Granderson it says - -",
  "That's right. But for the reason - -",
  "Well, I think with due respect what you're going to do is actually reduce the number of cases this court hears, because once you have a clear statement rule, two things are going to happen. The lower courts are going to find it more -- easier to resolve these kinds of cases because just like in the sovereign immunity and Federalism context, it's much easier to look for a clear statement. And even more importantly, Congress will know that when it legislates in the realm of criminal sentencing, that it needs to be clear, and it will solve this case -- this Court the problem, perhaps, of having four or five cases on its docket every term involving circuit splits and how to apply mandatory minimums in the vast labyrinth of Federal criminal sentencing provisions. So we think this Court can rest assured, of course, that if it rules for the Petitioner in this case and Congress doesn't like the result, that it is well and able and ready to step in to solve that problem. The problem is, is that if this Court accepts broad readings of the government, from the government of criminal statutes, that the institutional forces that drive legislation are -- make it much less likely that Congress can step in to solve that problem in favor of criminal defendants. So for the reasons we've explained, we think this Court should go back to the historical understanding brought forward to the present of the importance of the rule of lenity, and in this case find that the statute does not clearly and unambiguously apply to Petitioner. If there are no further questions, I'll submit the case.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The trial court was justified in requiring a higher level of competency for self-representation in order to prevent the trial of Ahmad Edwards from descending into a farce. Indeed, self-representation where a defendant cannot communicate coherently with the jury or the court would defeat the very autonomy interests that the Court ventured to protect in Faretta.",
  "Well, I certainly hope so. And I think on the record we've got here the trial court did not need to wait for that to happen. If the trial had begun with Mr. Edwards representing himself with the jury present, and the trial had then become so unwieldy and so farcical and such a mockery that he had -- his right of self-representation had to be overridden, I think there would have been a problem, a possible problem of taint with the jury. I think that the court was justified, having seen Mr. Edwards in court - -",
  "I don't think that Mr. Edwards's sort of waiver by conduct in that context is the only thing to consider. I think that the State's interests in having a proceeding that proceeds smoothly without episodes that render the proceedings potentially a mockery also are strong.",
  "You know, it's not clear to me that they would. It seems to me that their position is much more focused on the metes and bounds of what Faretta specifically recognized, which was requiring the defendant to comply with the rules and if there is a disorderly kind of behavior that would be sufficient. But I don't read their position to be that someone who is lacking in communications skills and coherent communications skills even on the record in the trial would be someone whose right of self-representation could be overridden.",
  "Well, it seems to me that we're in a world here where we don't really know what the precise rules would be because of the lack of clarity for the trial courts. So I don't want to tell you exactly what the Indiana courts would do, but I would imagine that a trial judge would be faced with a decision based on how long the trial has gone on, what the level of complexity of the trial is, what the level of farce or taint could be for the jury.",
  "Well, I think in the cases where this happened, whether it's because the trial was turned into a farce or because the defendant was excluded from the courtroom, as in Illinois v. Allen, I think the trial often proceeds.",
  "But I guess what I'm suggests is that there is always going to be the possibility in terms of a discretionary judgment call, whether it's a systematic rule or whether it's something up to the trial judge, that the court may decide that in interest of fairness, that the -- you know -- all the -- all that's gone on needs to be restarted, particularly if it hasn't gone on very far. I don't mean to suggest a rule in that regard. I'm suggesting - -",
  "Oh, the test.",
  "Well, the rule that we are suggesting -- and again let it caution that this is not a rule adopted by the Indiana Supreme Court yet -- is That it is within the State's authority to override this right where the defendant cannot communicate coherently with the court or the jury.",
  "I don't think it's any worse in terms of vagueness than what we deal with in Dusky. Now, Dusky talks about a reasonable level of understanding and a reasonable ability to assist the lawyer.",
  "No. I think that in circumstances such as those, there is another level of analysis, which is whether there's some sort of accommodation that can be made that would allow the representation, self-representation, to proceed by means of -- whether it's an interpreter or another means of communication. But What we're dealing with with Ahmad Edwards is someone whose thought processes so decompensate and become so disorganized that it's not - - it's not a matter of having an interpreter to carry out his instructions. It's a matter of having someone who can actually formulate a coherent defense and communicate that to the court and to the jury.",
  "No.",
  "We're not asking to get into that kind of level of detailed knowledge. All we're suggesting is that once the defendant has made the choices that are forced upon him essentially by the trial, i.e., the decision to represent himself and the decision whether to present a defense or not, that he can actually carry that out; whatever it is that he wants to do within the rules of the court, that he has the capability of effectuating that. And that's the problem Ahmad Edwards had.",
  "Well, we can, but we need not, I think is the point. And it's because there's a world of difference between lack of legal knowledge and the inability to relay a kind of coherent message that any person, lawyer or not, of ordinary kind of mental ability, capacity, would be able to formulate. I think that there are substantial doubts about whether somebody like Ahmad Edwards could convey to the jury that, in fact, what he wants to present is, for example, self-defense. What we're talking about here is that he may be thinking that and that may be something that Faretta entitles him to want to pursue on his own, but we're concerned that he couldn't in front of a jury communicate that that's what he was trying to - -",
  "Well, I think we're getting hopefully not into an area where there would be legitimate questions about underlying Dusky competency. I mean, it seems to me in that circumstance you could have that level of concern as well. And then, beyond that, if someone is using a sort of insanity demonstration in the context of the trial, it seems to me the court could fall back on not this rule, but on the rule that there has to be a defense that's within the bounds of the rules of the court.",
  "Well, I do think there's a line that can be drawn between a ridiculous defense that's within the bounds of sort of relevance and possibility, such as, you know, a very ill-advised self-defense theory, and the idea that the Martians did it, which I think raises substantial questions as to Dusky competency as well. Now, I think that even looking at the Court's later cases after Faretta, if we look at Martinez and McKaskle, we see the same sense of balancing that is what we're advocating here. I think that McKaskle, recognizing that is a role sometimes for standby counsel and that it is to be limited, is something that starts down this road. And we're not talking about a rule here I think that would threaten the underlying decision that Faretta protects. We're talking about a rule that is simply designed to let a trial court ensure that the decisions that the defendant makes are going to effectuate - -",
  "Well, I think the benefits of the rule, first and foremost, is that the State has and the judicial system has greater certainty that there was a fair trial, that the adversarial process played out in a way that gave the jury, you know, a meaningful decision to make, and also that it conveys to the public that this is a reliable system. Now, you're very right. This may introduce inefficiencies, and we don't know what the Indiana Supreme Court would make of that in its role as the supervising court for the Indiana -- for the Indiana courts. But I think that what courts have an impression of, including the Indiana Supreme Court, is that they're not allowed to undertake that balance, that Godinez and Faretta combine to preclude that option, and that's what we want the Court to clear up, to say that they do have that option.",
  "Well, I think that they're - - trial courts are always going to be concerned about going too far and being reversed on those grounds. So it seems to me that the same kinds of concerns that they deal with when they're making an evaluation of Dusky competency and making, you know, evaluation of whether a waiver is known and voluntary, those kinds of incentives would kind of be the same here in terms of not wanting to go too far.",
  "I think so. I think it would be something very - -",
  "-- very much akin to what we look at with Dusky. Whether there are factual determinations may be reviewed for clear error, but the overall judgment is essentially an abuse of discretion, a deferential kind of - -",
  "Yes.",
  "I agree with that.",
  "Well, I think that -- we're not suggesting a rule that is unlimited in that regard. The concern for fair trial is something that I think in a lot of other Sixth Amendment contexts has some leeway, but it also has limits. In the Wheat case, for example, where the Court overrode the choice of -- first choice paid counsel in view of conflicts of interest and the fairness questions those raised, I don't think the Court has been terribly concerned that interest runs wild and that it overrides that right.",
  "Well, again, I think that there is a qualitative, a real -- a sort of realistic line to be drawn between someone who maybe has bad ideas and bad judgments and someone who just cannot communicate what those judgments are. In other words, someone who is unable, particularly in an unstructured, stressful environment, to communicate what it is that their message is to the jury, to the judge - -",
  "Well, I think that there - -",
  "Because I think that the -- the kinds of decisions that someone would make that would be -- I think even if well-communicated, would demonstrating a farcical trial, would threaten the Dusky competency standard. They would -- they would raise questions in that regard. Now, if someone just had a bad notion of what it is to defend themselves and what idea they're trying to present to the jury, I don't think, if that is communicated coherently, that that presents the same concerns of a farcical trial that we have with Ahmad Edwards.",
  "Well, again, I think that there are limits on what we're arguing, and I think that - - that the Wheat case demonstrates how there can be flexibility here in terms of pursuing these fairness interests without overriding completely the self-representation interests -- or, I'm sorry, the Sixth Amendment interests of a larger set of defendants.",
  "Right. And I think that you don't really have an unwieldy standard here any more than with respect to Dusky when you're looking at evaluations of statements and other things that the defendant might have made. If I may, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Well, I think the defendant in Godinez was pleading guilty. I think here if you have a defendant where it might create a different question if there was some reliable that evidence that that might be true. But it would be hard to imagine that if a trial court would have to take the defendant's word for it entirely, that he would sit silent.",
  "I think it does present a different situation if the defendant sits silent and relies only on the reasonable doubt instruction than to have a defendant who is going to present an actual defense. Here I think you have got a defendant who, while competent at the time of trial, the day before, a few days before trial wrote a letter to the court saying: Dear Judge Hawkins, I want to extend the court power for training for this enormously wide defense to exercise also U.S. continent five as it becomes more advanced parts differently to structure First Amendment. Trial to do your best old man to isolate the young boy in me at this. So I think we have got a clear example of someone who could communicate with counsel as the Sena report indicated.",
  "Well, no. I think even in the statements in open court you have got a lack of coherence and lack of understanding. And counsel was there, I think, to usher through some of those statements that made system somewhat comprehensible. But there's, I think, every reason for the court to look at these writings and to also fall back on what he had seen in open court to come to the conclusion that this was somebody who couldn't be relied phenomenon communicate coherently. I think relying on the Allen standard is a mistake for the additional reason in addition to not specifically covering this kind of scenario, it also might then lead to circumstances where trial courts are tightening up the Allen standard for all defendants whose wish to represent themselves. So even when you don't have concerns about this kind of competency, the courts are going to be in a position where they look at this Court's precedent and say, oh, we're supposed to enforce Allen strictly and we have got a rules violation, so therefore, we have to override the self-representation request. And I think that that's probably not what the Court would want to do just to provide that as a vehicle for dealing with dependents such as Ahmad Edwards. Now, I think it is also important to bear in mind that -- that we can speak about fairness in trial and the appearance of fairness in trial and not be speaking, strictly speaking about due process, about the Due Process Clause. And that's the point of the wheat case. We don't have to think that the State's concerns for fairness are limited by the Due Process Clause. We can acknowledge that there are other circumstances that courts -- that trial courts in states can take into account when they are dealing with Sixth Amendment rights. And there, of course, it was the Sixth Amendment right - -",
  "I think it -- I think many in the public would think that that was fair. That, in fact, the court is taking care of a defendant in those circumstances. Now, that is counterbalanced by the Faretta right. But I think courts -- State courts and State systems should be in the position of taking into consideration what they think appears fair in that kind of circumstance.",
  "Right. And I think there are opportunities, then, to be concerned about competency based on psychiatric reports that could lead to a Dusky determination in addition to determination that we're seeking.",
  "Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This country has not executed anyone for a rape of any kind in over 43 years. Louisiana's attempt to reintroduce this practice into American society violates the Eighth Amendment for two distinct reasons. First, a long-standing national consensus exists against it. Indeed, Louisiana's capital rape law is particularly at odds with national values because Louisiana is the only State in which Petitioner, as a non-recidivist, could be subject to the death penalty. Second, Louisiana's law violates this Court's Eighth Amendment-narrowing jurisprudence. It gives juries unfettered discretion to choose who, among the vast class of offenders convicted of child rape, may be subject to the death penalty. Now, this is in stark contrast to the handful of other States that have capital rape laws that they've recently enacted. Texas, for example, requires an offender to have served a prior sentence for the same crime of 25 years before - -",
  "It's no doubt a serious crime, Justice Scalia, but I believe this Court's narrowing jurisprudence requires narrowing beyond a particularly heinous crime. Of course, in Godfrey and Gregg against Georgia, this Court said that deliberate murder is not on its own enough to subject an offender to the death penalty. So there's two problems that arise with Louisiana's statute in the context of this Court's narrowing jurisprudence.",
  "Well, there could be several aggravating facts that would make a rape of a child, or indeed of any person, a particularly egregious crime, but in Coker against Georgia, this Court did not simply hold that the Eighth Amendment prohibited imposing the death penalty for the crime of rape; it held that this Court -- that the Eighth Amendment prohibited imposing the death penalty for rape with aggravating circumstances. Remember in Coker against Georgia, there were two aggravating circumstances in that case. First, the offender was a recidivist. He had been convicted of rape three times, was a convicted murder who had escaped from prison. Second, he committed the rape in the course of committing other very serious felonies, including kidnapping and robbery. And so, at the very minimum, the State stands here with the burden today to say that an average child rape is worse than the crime in Coker, that this Court held was not sufficiently superior - -",
  "If - -",
  "Well, no question that would be a much stronger argument under this Court's narrowing jurisprudence. Now, you'd still be left with two problems with that kind of a statute: First, you'd still potentially be left with the problem that this Court addressed in Furman and all the subsequent cases of having a large class of offenders of which only a few get the death penalty. Now, there needs to be some reason to differentiate. The State might well say -- especially the State of Texas and other States that have these very severe recidivist requirements might say that is good enough, but they'd still be left with the -- with the argument that they would have to make that a person who convicts -- who commits child rape and does not -- it does not result any death, is a worse offender than somebody who deliberately kills somebody - -",
  "-- on average.",
  "I'm not sure it would, Justice Souter. Remember Coker tells us, I think, that you can't simply start with rape and then add an aggravating circumstance, in terms of this Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence. But even if you're asking, just in terms - -",
  "Let me first say that the State hasn't alleged those things that Justice Powell identified. So, even if Justice Powell's opinion controlled, I think we would prevail here. But remember - -",
  "Well, my understanding of this Court's Marks rule is that the narrowest opinion that commands a majority -- so Justice Powell's opinion was actually a seventh vote. If you count the two Justices on this Court who held the death penalty was unconstitutional across the board and add the four that constituted the plurality in Coker, we think the plurality opinion becomes - -",
  "-- the controlling one.",
  "Well, I'm not aware of any wrinkle in this Court's jurisprudence that says that if a Justice is too far out of the mainstream that their vote is discounted.",

  "Yes.",
  "Well, I think it's possible, but this Court has understood -- I think well understood that it is a practical problem. It is one that gives this Court caution before ruling a law unconstitutional. Here, I don't think - -",

  "I don't - -",
  "I don't think that's necessarily the case, Justice Scalia. And, of course, there are narrower ways to decide this case that could leave open the possibility of future developments. But, Mr. Chief Justice, I want to answer your question and say I think there may be a misunderstanding that this Court really needs to address that in this case, because we have had, since 1995 when the State of Louisiana passed this law and the year after when the supreme court of Louisiana upheld it in a very widely covered opinion from which this Court denied certiorari, there has been a national debate for 12 or 13 years already as to the propriety of imposing the death - -",
  "I think that's right. You have to ask yourself the question whether that is enough.",
  "I think this Court said in Atkins - -",
  "Clearly, I think that Atkins and Roper look at trend among other things. And I think it is important to remember that there were 20 States in each of those cases that allowed the death penalty under those circumstances, but I think we have to ask ourselves whether the movement that's occurred over the past dozen years is enough to matter.",
  "Well, as it happened here, States can pass laws, and they can bring prosecutions potentially reaching - -",
  "Well, a State could do something like what Georgia has done, which is pass a law that says that the death penalty is permissible in a given crime -- in, for example, rape -- to the extent allowed by the United States Supreme Court, which is the extent allowed by the Eighth Amendment. If several States pass laws like that, eventually this Court even -- let's say the Court decides this case in my favor today. Eventually this Court could take notice of that and take certiorari and again decide whether or not the Eighth Amendment was - -",
  "Of course.",
  "There's no double about that, and it happens frequently. Now I want to ask about - -",
  "As I said, it may be practically difficult, but it's not impossible, because this Court could eventually take notice of what it was seeing. Now, I think it is important to ask - -",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I think there are two problems with that. First, it is a theoretical argument that doesn't have any factual underpinning. There is no evidence in any State legislature that Coker has stood in the way of enacting statutes like this. And, again, I want to emphasize to this Court to remember, if there were any overhang or distorting effect of Coker, it certainly would have gone away by 1996 when the Louisiana supreme court laid out a very detailed opinion explaining why a law like this could be constitutional and, in effect, exhorting other States to pass laws like it. And so for a dozen years in death-penalty jurisdictions there has been a very vigorous effort by proponents of these laws to get statutes like this passed. And look what we end up with. Mr. Chief Justice, I want to bring myself back to your trend question. What we end up with is exactly the same number of States allowing the death penalty here as allowed it in Coker in 1977.",
  "There are, no doubt, various legislative considerations. I just would - -",
  "Oh, absolutely, Justice Scalia.",
  "No. Absolutely, I think that it would not continue.",
  "If -- and I think it is important to understand not just the Louisiana supreme court; but in 2004, when Patrick Kennedy was put on death row in Louisiana, in light of this Court's Atkins and Roper jurisprudence, notice was served in all death-penalty jurisdictions that if you want a law like this, you've got a few years to pass it before this case gets to the Supreme Court. I think that's why you have seen an uptick of two or there other States passing laws in the last couple of years. But, again, all that has done is recreate the situation this Court faced in 1977 in Coker, where six States would have allowed the death penalty for child rape. And in Roper this Court emphasized that it would be very ironic to find a trend or a lack of movement dispositive if the reason for that action more recently is because long ago society recognized that this was an improper punishment and this Court - -",
  "I think they may well, Justice Alito. It's important to recognize not just - - well, in Roper this Court said -- I think it addressed a similar question. There has to be a line somewhere in terms of the Eighth Amendment. Now, we can imagine a terribly serious case with a juvenile offender who is 17 years old, for example, but drawing a line in a place that makes sense almost all of the time is the best we can do. If a State were to come up and make the argument today that: Imagine the most heinous child rape you can, first of all, it wouldn't say that under the narrowing problem because of Maynard against Cartwright. But, more importantly, other States would beg to differ. Look at Utah. Utah thinks the next most serious crime after murder is assault, an aggravated assault on a prison guard. South Dakota thinks the next most serious crime after murder is aggravated kidnapping. Once you roll the line back from the line established in Coker, which is requiring the death of the victim, it becomes extraordinarily difficult to figure out where the line is going to be drawn for Eighth Amendment purposes.",
  "Well, this Court has always differentiated its proportionality analysis from capital to a non-capital context. In Coker, Enmund, Tison, all of those cases, rest to a significant degree on the seriousness of the crime. I think perhaps the best discussion is made - -",

  "No, Your Honor. And I think if anyone thought that the treason laws were implicated here, you might have different parties before the Court.",
  "Well, Blackstone thought treason was more serious than murder. It has traditionally been the most serious crime that a person can commit, and I think historically, as well at nationally, that is still the sentiment that is shared.",
  "Now - -",
  "Well, I don't think societal attitudes have changed very much. But to the extent any of it has, what this Court said in Atkins is you look to the expertise of professional organizations; and I think it is relevant here that if the State stands up and says well, the reason why we are doing this is because of more enlightened attitudes about the harm that occurs in child rape, all of the professional organizations sex assault groups, social workers, and the like that deal with that crime, like here in the amicus - -",
  "Perhaps not. I don't know. I mean, this Court chooses its words -- other parts of the Coker decision I think make clear that the Court understood that rape was an extraordinarily serious crime.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I think, although not with the same historical pedigree, the same argument is being put forward by the State today, that by definition, for a child to have been raped is tantamount to having been killed, and the social workers and sex assault experts here today I think are telling you with this one voice, we very much want to avoid sending - -",
  "I think that's fair enough, Justice Ginsburg, but I think also I'd like -- perhaps Justice Alito was right, that looking at the Court's opinion gives us the best indication of the analysis; and I think the parts that you were reading are from the earlier part of the opinion where the Court was saying that rape in general is not as serious as murder, but the end of the plurality win in Coker is very emphatic. It says, that doesn't end the question, because we have two very serious aggravating circumstances and this is a particularly serious incident of rape. Even then, the Court's words were, that does not change the fact that the victim is not killed. So that is - -",
  "We don't argue otherwise. We understand Coker says adult woman. What we're saying is that the rationale of Coker, and not just the rationale requiring somebody to have died, but also the objective rationale in Coker, of saying we understand in the past four, five years, there's been a handful; of States that have come forward with laws like this but we nonetheless find a national consensus against it. Look at the numbers in Coker. You had 30 people on death row over the span of five or six years for rape, as compared to this case, you have two people on death row over a span of 13 years. Even the practices on the ground indicate quite strongly that society and even Louisiana -- look at Louisiana where in direct contrast to the way they prosecute murder cases, in which it is common for the prosecution to take the position that the death penalty is the only appropriate punishment for this crime, they offer life imprisonment. They've offered life in prison in every single child rape case they've prosecuted in the in the last 13 years. The only reason you have Patrick Kennedy here today and one other offender on death row is because they insisted on their innocence. If there are no further questions, I - -",
  "Well, I think there are two ways to decide this case on more narrow grounds, I'll offer this answer to your question. First, this Court could say that Louisiana is the only State that doesn't require recidivism, so it fails the substantive Tison - Roper analysis. It could also say that -- that Louisiana's law isn't sufficiently narrow. Yes, Justice Kennedy, I think if the question is could there be another particularly heinous circumstance that you, just in the context of narrowing would be enough, one might imagine other aggravating circumstances. Coker wouldn't be - -",
  "One could imagine something like torture or extraordinarily serious harm in a case, something like that. But again, that would - -",
  "I'm not sure what the question is.",
  "I think that's right, Justice Scalia. Perhaps the States want to speak to that. They're the ones that put it in their law. But it reinforces - -",
  "Yes, in Texas and a couple of other States. I think it reinforces the fact that they think that by and large child rape is not serious enough even in those States to trigger the death penalty, and so they're looking for an extraordinarily small class. If there are no further questions, I'll reserve my time.",
  "I would like to address first the narrowing component of this case and then turn to the idea of trends on the first question presented. First, the reasons for this Court's narrowing jurisprudence is to avoid a situation in which a few, only a few offenders out of a vast pool are given the death penalty, and there's no legal principled explanation to describe why those offenders get the death penalty. Ms. Clark says that Louisiana's law is narrow. Well, if you just look at empiric, as best as we've been able to gather statistics and Texas has some similar statistics in its brief, we're talking about under Louisiana's definition of child rape about five times as many individuals per year as are convicted of deliberate murder. This is enormous class. And what you end up with is only one every several years getting the death penalty. That is the definition of arbitrary and capriciousness. Justice Breyer, Mr. Cruz is right, Louisiana Supreme Court at 58(a) addressed -- addressed -- as existed at trial, it included or rape. I'm not sure exactly under ex post facto which is the operative one or not, but it doesn't matter because even the anal or vaginal component statute still gets you five times as many -- than just absolutely being struck by lightning. Even in Louisiana simply consensual sex between an 18-year-old and a 12-year-old is a capital offense. And so we don't think Louisiana's law sufficiently narrows. Mr. Cruz says - -",
  "It is with respect to narrowing, because Mr. Cruz -- the only answer to that, I think is what Mr. Cruz - -",
  "We absolutely do - -",
  "There's square precedent, unanimous holding of this Court in Maynard against Cartwright so that you can't justify a statute that fails to narrow on as applied grounds. The constitutional infirmity is the fact that it gives unfettered discretion to prosecutors and juries to choose who to give the death sentence to.",
  "At the end of the day the jury has discretion. But the difference between that case and this case is that you have a much smaller pool of offenders and a much higher likelihood the jury is going to return death. Here you have have a vast pool and literally persons one out of every several years getting the death penalty. If I could say a thing -- two things about the trend argument that the states have putting forward? First, remember there's no trend whatsoever with respect to non-recidivists. The other states that have passed laws in child rape context for capital - - making it a capital crime and even in the Meagan law and others is all about recidivism. Louisiana is not part of that trend. Louisiana stands alone.",
  "I think - -",
  "Well, it would give you a narrower way to do this case. You could say that under the analysis -- Roper actions Louisiana stands alone in terms of what is national consensus. In Enmund this Court said that it is not enough for other states to make the basic crime a capital offense. We look to see whether if the other states require an aggravating circumstance, that the State before the Court does not; an aggravating circumstance that makes the offender more culpable or the crime more serious. We exclude those states from our bean counting analysis.",
  "If we're looking at trends, perhaps I can leave you with this: Again, remember what we have in terms of a trend. All we have done in the past 30 years is returned to the place that we were 30 years ago in Coker. In Coker when you read that opinion, six states make child rape a capital offense. Through all the might and effort of proponents of these laws, what they've been able to accomplish over 31 years is to bring it back exactly where we were in Coker this. This Court's whole Eighth Amendment jurisprudence is based on the idea that a few states may well have laws making something a capital crime and may choose to be outliers, but the very notion of this Court's proportionality jurisprudence is that when states are outliers, and especially in a case like this, when even are those outlier states impose the death penalty so rarely and freakishly, that is a situation where the Eighth Amendment does not tolerate it.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State is here today making what we think is a rather extraordinary argument. It's arguing that there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury in this case interpreted the accomplice liability charge in the same manner that the State itself urged the jury to interpret it; that the State urged the Washington Court of Appeals to interpret it on direct review in this case and in many other cases, and how the Washington Court of Appeals in fact interpreted it.",
  "That's right, Your Honor. So there is a constitutional violation, and then our burden, which we believe we can carry on the extraordinary record in this case, is to show that a court, the Washington Court of Appeals, could not have reasonably concluded that there was a reasonable likelihood the jury understood the charge in this case.",
  "Well, Justice Alito, we think it is fair to say that, because in the Washington Court of Appeals decision, they start by laying out the statutory language of Washington accomplice liability. And remember, the jury instruction in this case simply tracks that language. That's, in fact, one of the State's argument. Now, our response to that argument is, just as you said, Justice Alito, when a State supreme court, as the Washington court later did in this case, steps in and applies a gloss to that language and interprets it, as this Court has said many times, it's as though that language is written into the statute.",
  "Got it right insofar as regurgitated the language of the statute. But the Washington law that would apply to this case -- and I think there is an agreement on this, Justice Kennedy, is that Mr. Sarausad has to know that he was promoting or facilitating a homicide. That's what he has to know. That's theory one of the State's - -",
  "The problem, Your Honor, is it starts with this Court recognized him void. Juries are lay people, and they understand things in terms of common sense.",
  "Let me take your question in two steps, Justice Breyer.",
  "Thank you. First I want to emphasize we are not alleging prosecutorial misconduct in this case in any way. The problem is - -",
  "Right.",
  "That's right. Let me -- all I meant to say was the prevailing view in the State at the time of this trial was that any crime was sufficient, and so that's why the prosecutor was entitled to make that argument. Let me take your question in two steps, first the ambiguity in the language. As the Washington courts themselves and as the States themselves argue at page 38 and 39 of the appendix of our red brief, you can interpret the language in the statute, when you get to words \"the crime\", to mean one of two things: One, it could mean as you said, Justice Breyer, that the particular crime the principal committed; or it could mean one could understand it to mean simply the principal's criminal conduct. And in Washington - -",
  "Well, maybe the best that I can do, Justice Breyer, is refer you to empirical evidence from the State itself, from the State of Washington, and if you need one further thing to look at, I commend to you the Supreme Court decision of the Supreme Court of Colorado that cited in the actual brief -- there was language exactly like this that comes to a textual analysis and comes to the conclusion.",
  "Because the articles \"a\" and \"the\" are simply not definite enough. And you can read the words \"the crime\" to simply mean criminal conduct. Now, let me talk about the prosecutor's argument.",
  "I think if that's all we had, Mr. Chief Justice, you would be exactly right. So let me turn now - -",
  "Right. Right. Because the test that this Court has repeated many times is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that this jury misapplied the instruction. Now, let me turn to the prosecutor's argument, because there was a lot of discussion about that in the first half an hour. There is two places in the joint appendix that you might want to pay attention to, and I think we might have been referring to two different places earlier. In joint appendix page 38, the prosecutor makes her opening argument and says -- and uses the assault analogy of holding somebody's arms behind their back. And she tells the jury this is -- as Justice Ginsburg was reading -- this is the law of the State of Washington. And again, in direct rebuttal at page 123 of the joint appendix, the prosecutor again says very specifically -- specifically to the jury, let me talk to you about the accomplice liability instruction.",
  "There were objections both before and after.",
  "There were times where Mr. Sarausad's counsel, you're right, did ask for a little more than he was entitled to. But Mr. Reyes' counsel made objections directly on point, which Mr. Sarausad joined, and as Justice Ginsburg noted earlier, when the jury comes back with the third question that is precisely on point, it's precisely the question on which that whole entire case turns -- and I might add there would be no reason for the jury to ask that third question, what kind of knowledge is required in this case, if they had decided, as the State argues, that Mr. Sarausad knew a homicide was going to be committed.",
  "Well, we think it's pretty clear, Mr. Chief Justice. I think the more important sentence may be the one that precedes that question, which is the jury tells the court, after seven days of deliberations: We are having difficulty agreeing on the legal definition and concept of accomplice. Now, that is the question -- and let me return to the prosecutor's argument - -",
  "Well, I think the best we can do, because we have to make reasonable inferences from the record and he we can't go back and ask the jurors what we thought, is we have to make, as the court has done many times, reasonable inferences as to what they are doing. And I think the fairest reading of this record, even if it's not absolutely clear, is that the jury was honing in progressively on the central issue in this case, and that was Mr. Sarausad's mens rea.",
  "Your Honor, we are not challenging -- or this Court does not have authorities the sufficiency of the evidence in this case, so there might be enough evidence in the record for the jury to have found that. But the question is, did the jury find that? And we can't know from the instructions given in light of the arguments made to the jury by the prosecutor and the jury's own questions trying to sort through them, this case -- whether the jury actually found that. And so if the State wanted -- this goes again to the prosecutor's argument. There is two things that I think we might be conflating improperly here. There is the first question of what the prosecutor argued to the jury Washington law meant. And I suggest to you if you look at JA 38 and JA 123, there is no doubt what the prosecutor was arguing to the jury Washington law meant. It meant as she said, \"in or a dime, in for a dollar.\" If you hold somebody's arms behind their back thinking that an assault is going to occur and the person dies, you can be found guilty of murder.",
  "Both before and after, Justice Kennedy. But I would add that another reason the defense counsel may not have interposed yet another objection at that instance was because that was the prevailing view of Washington law at the time.",
  "I don't think so, Justice Alito. That would have cleared up the ambiguity in the case.",
  "No, it's not because what you did is you inserted the name of the crime in there.",
  "That's exactly what defendants even still in the State of Washington are asking courts to do in the - -",
  "Yes, under the particular circumstances in this case, because the jury expressed confusion. So we know the jury was confused. We know the only reason they would have asked that is if they had not found the facts the State alleges, at least at that point, that Mr. Sarausad knew a murder was going to occur, and also because we know the prosecutor argued the exact opposite to them. They were actually asking the question -- another way to put it, I think which is a fair characterization is, is what the prosecutor told us correct? That - -",
  "I'm sorry, Justice Breyer. You need more than that in this case. Second degree murder is intentional. So - -",
  "Intentionally killing is what the State says.",
  "I think that - -",
  "The defendant didn't have to have premedication, Justice Kennedy. I think the best answer I can give and I -- is that we agree with the State on this. We agree with what the State said at page 31 of its brief, that it had to prove that Mr. Sarausad knew he was aiding or facilitating a homicide. That he knew, and it was argued to this case, Justice -- as it was argued to the jury, Justice Breyer, the defense agreed that if Mr. Sarausad knew there was a gun in his car, or if he knew that the fellows were planning on killing somebody, that he could have been found guilty. That was the very -- that was the central issue in this case; and when the State stands up and says the prosecutor argued -- didn't make -- didn't make a misleading argument, what they are talking about are the prosecutor's arguments on the facts. After telling the jury had is what Washington law is, the prosecutor argued in various ways that Mr. Sarausad knew that a fight was going to happen, or -- or that a gun was - -",
  "That's right. But I think you don't - -",
  "Because when somebody is punched in the stomach there is no reasonable belief that the person is going to be put in grave risk of death. And so as I said, the issue of this case, that the whole entire case was about, and that the jury was demonstrably perplexed about, was what did Mr. Sarausad know. And when the State says, well -- the prosecutor argued to the jury that he knew their shooting was going to happen or that he knew a gun was in the car, if the jury had believed that they could have come back with a guilty verdict in 30 minutes; but instead they asked a series of questions culminating in the one after seven days of deliberation which can only be interpreted as suggesting that we don't believe that Mr. Sarausad knew that the worst was going to happen here, and we are struggling to figure out what kind of verdict we have to render in light of that.",
  "I think a standard statement to that effect was made. But remember two things, Justice Alito. First, the prosecutor herself kept telling the jury this is what the State of Washington law requires. And as this Court has recognized in other cases, the prosecutor isn't just any old lawyer standing in front of a jury. The prosecutor carries with her the imprimatur of the government; and so we think it's perfectly reasonable for the jury to have understood the prosecutor to be arguing this is what the law is, and at the very least to have created a question in their minds. And if I contrast this case with Brown against Payton, because Justice Breyer has asked about that case and it is another case where the prosecutor made what this Court found was a misleading argument to the jury, there you have a very different situation. Not only do you have no jury questions at all coming in that case to demonstrate to the Court that the jury was in fact confused and likely to follow the prosecutor's advice, but you have a very different scenario in Brown, where this Court said that in light of the way that case was actually argued, the prosecutor was really making more of an argument on the facts, that these arguments the defendant has made shouldn't really be considered mitigating evidence in your deliberations; and as this Court said the jury must have taken it as a factual argument because otherwise the whole mitigation hearing would have been totally unnecessary. Now, under the -- under the facts of this case, the way this case was tried -- and again I want to emphasize that at the time this case was tried, the prosecutor had the better of the argument as to what Washington law is. This case is only before you because it's the oddball case, and the only one I can think of that's like it is when this Court had in about 2000, or decided in 2001, called Fiore v White, when in Pennsylvania the State brought a prosecution and obtained a conviction for discharging hazardous waste without a permit, and then the Pennsylvania Supreme Court later said that not having a permit is required under the statute. It's not enough to prove to the jury that he so deviated from the permit that -- that no permit existed. And then this Court said once we know that clarification under State law, we look back and it's clear as day that the jury didn't find that element. Now the only difference between that case and this case is that in Fiore it was absolutely certain the jury didn't find the element and the prosecution didn't argue otherwise. Here you have enough ambiguous evidence and ambiguity in the jury instructions that the State was trying to backfill after it has lost the case in the Washington Supreme Court and say no, the jury in this case even though we told them they didn't have to find it, did go ahead and find it.",
  "Well, not directly.",
  "Right. So, the relevance - -",
  "That's right, Justice Alito and I know that you know that case. The -- you're right. So we are on all fours with Fiore in the sense that the later decision from the State Supreme Court applies retroactively, and in Fiore what you would have had, the court didn't need to talk about jury instructions, because I take it that the jury was instructed in Fiore that deviating substantially from a permit satisfies the no-permit element of that defense, and so the jury was given there, simply an instruction that was simply wrong. And here our contention is that the -- that the jury charge taken in light of the case was ambiguous, but that distinction doesn't matter because as this Court has said in Boyde and Estelle and many other cases, all you have to show is a reasonable likelihood that the jury misunderstood the charge. Now we have to show an additional layer of unreasonableness because we are on habeas now and no longer on direct review, but for all the reasons that are apparent on the face of this record this is the extraordinary case.",
  "There's two ways to think about it. Yes, that could be one way to think about it. The other way that they might have been thinking about it was whether he knew that a murder was going to happen and that a killing was going to happen.",
  "That's the way the case was presented to the jury.",
  "That's right, Justice Stevens. The defendant - -",
  "Precisely. And the defense counsel -- the defense counsel admitted in argument that if you find he knew there was a gun in the car, then we lose. And, remember, the jury earlier -- we've talk about the three jury questions about what the law meant. Remember the jury earlier asked to have Mr. Sarausad's testimony reread back to them. So, again, every indication is you have a jury really trying very, very hard to do their job.",
  "It's the rule that is stated - - again, at page 32 of the State's brief with which we agree -- that if there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury applied instructions so as to violate the Constitution, then that violates due process.",
  "That's right.",
  "The State would have a better argument if nothing else had happened in this trial other than simply the jury had been given that instruction, but our point is, and then this Court recognizes as much, I think, in Brown against Payton, that the prosecutor's arguments do matter. They are to be considered in the calculus. And this Court said in Estelle that instructions cannot be considered in isolation. They have to be considered in the totality of the way the case was tried. And so my point, Mr. Chief Justice, is the reason why the State cannot show that the State court of appeals decision was reasonable is because it's not just the instruction that had perplexed the State and Washington courts over the years; it's the fact that the prosecutor asked the jury to adopt the wrong interpretation of the instruction and that the jury came back and told the court -- I think -- maybe it helps to think about the case this way: After seven days of deliberation -- now I understand that we can dispute a little bit what the jury was asking, but I think a fair statement is that after seven days of deliberation, the jury was telling the court at a minimum there's a reasonable likelihood we don't understand accomplice liability in this case and that we are going to find that as long as Sarausad was a member of this gang and willingly participated in gang activity, that that's enough to hold him liable for accomplice murder. And that's what the State had argued alternatively, Your Honor. So after seven days, there's no guesswork that's even required. We know the jury was confused and going down the wrong path. And so the only way the State can rescue that is to say that, upon being told to read the same charge that it been told to read three previous times, that suddenly the light bulb went off so dramatically that it reduced its confusion below the 50/50 level. Now that's what this Court said in Brown against Payton. The reasonable likelihood test is below So we think if you were the Washington Court of Appeals -- and I think this is another way to ask yourselves the question you have to decide in this case. If you were the Washington Court of Appeals on this record, would it be reasonable for you to say that this jury was not even reasonably likely to misunderstand the accomplice liability instruction in this case?",
  "Well, we have all three, but I don't want to give away too much. I think it is fair to say that the jury's third question is perfectly clear. I hedged a minute to be frank so that I could acknowledge the Court's earlier questions and get -- and get my statement out, but in all honesty, I think that the third jury question makes it clear that the jury is confused. But we have -- again, unlike Brown against Payton, unlike Weeks against Angelone, we have this amazing constellation of all these mutually - -",
  "That's a fair characterization, Justice Breyer. If you look at the hypothetical that the State gives the jury as to what Washington law means, it is clear that's the argument they're making. On the facts they made alternative arguments.",
  "Thank you very much.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Crawford v. Washington, this Court made clear that the right to confrontation, at its core, is a protection against a system of trial by affidavit. It is an ancient procedural guarantee that requires the prosecution to prove its case through live witnesses who testify before the jury and who are subject to cross-examination. Introducing forensic laboratory reports, such as the certificates at issue in this case, is the modern equivalent of trial by affidavit. The documents are sworn formal statements. They are crafted purposefully for the express purpose of proving a fact that is an element of a criminal offense, and, as the State forthrightly admits in its brief, they are introduced in lieu of having the analyst called as a witness to the stand. They are therefore quintessentially testimonial evidence. Massachusetts - -",
  "That's right. Our position - - our position is that whoever the Commonwealth wants to use to prove the fact that they are trying to prove is the person that needs to take the stand. In this case, it would be the analyst.",
  "I took the Chief Justice's hypothetical to be that the supervisor had actually done the testing, but if the supervisor had not - -",
  "That's right. There is no substantive right. I think everything you've said is right as far as it goes. It just depends what the Commonwealth wants to put in in terms of evidence.",
  "If they want to put in - -",
  "Well, if that's what -- at a minimum, that's what we want, Justice Kennedy. This Court has made clear in California - -",
  "Well, we don't know what we are going to get. In some cases, unquestionably - -",
  "But even in a test where the analyst doesn't remember and, as you put it, it's a standardized test, there are still plenty of questions the defendant might want to ask, such as what test was performed? We don't even know from the record what test was performed in this case. What's the error rate on that test? How do your protocols work? What are your experience and credentials in analyzing those? There's plenty of questions the defendant might ask.",
  "Well, I think that's a choice that defense counsel could make, as the defense counsel always has a choice in a criminal case to decide whether to press the prosecution's evidence or to simply stay silent and then later argue at closing the prosecution hasn't given you enough to prove the case. But to the extent the Commonwealth is taking the position that cross-examining would be fruitless in a situation like this, the very basis of this Court's Crawford decision is that's not for courts to decide. It is up to the defense counsel to -- if he wishes, to insist on live testimony that he can cross-examine and then - -",
  "Well, three reasons, Justice Ginsburg: First, if that were correct, then I don't see anything that would stop the prosecution in every criminal case simply from putting a pile of affidavits on a judge's desk and saying it's up to the defense to call whatever witnesses he wants and cross-examine them. But even as a matter of text and structure of the Constitution, as a textual matter, the right to confrontation is a passive right in the defendant's hands. It requires the prosecution to arrange for the confrontation, and that's bolstered structurally by the Compulsory Process Clause. Remember, the Compulsory Process Clause gives the defendant the very right that you just explained, that the defendant can subpoena witnesses into court and ask them questions. And surely the Confrontation Clause adds something on top of that. And I think this Court's decision in Taylor against Illinois is the best explanation of the difference between the two clauses. This Court said that the Confrontation Clause arises simply by the nature of adversary proceedings, and it's a -- it's a rule that governs the way the prosecution must introduce its case. As I said at the opening here, it's a requirement that the prosecution put its live witnesses on the stand for the jury to observe them. The defense, of course, has the decision whether to cross-examine those witnesses, or if witnesses are not called by the prosecution that he would wish to be part of the case, he can subpoena them. But we would vigorously oppose any attempt to shift the burden on the defense to call witnesses like this.",
  "There is a variety of notice-and-demand type statutes, Justice Ginsburg, and I think the law professors' brief lays it out the best of what we have before you. We agree with the Solicitor General that a plain notice-and-demand statute that requires the defense to do nothing more than assert his right in advance of trial to have the prosecution put a live witness on the stand would be constitutional, I think, under this Court's jurisprudence. Under the Compulsory Process Clause, under the jury right, there are plenty of constitutional rights that, with fair notice, a Defendant can be required to assert in advance of trial. Now, there are other types of statutes that other States call \"notice and demand\" that require something more of the defendant, whether it be that the defendant himself call the witness, whether it be the defendant himself make some kind of good faith or prima facie showing in order to have the prosecution call the witness. Those types of statutes, I think this Court, to the extent in this opinion it would mention notice-and-demand statutes, it would want to be careful to leave for another day, because, again, we would agree with the Solicitor General that those would raise more difficult constitutional questions.",
  "Okay. Thank you. I -- I took Justice Ginsburg's question to be asking whether giving the defendant the right to subpoena the witness would be adequate under the Confrontation Clause if these documents were testimonial. Now, your question is whether they might not be testimonial at all viewed through the lens of whether they are a business record. So, as a historical matter, I think it's plain that no documents prepared in contemplation of litigation were ever considered to be business records. And this Court's decision in Palmer v. Hoffman in 1943 I think lays that out very, very clearly. So there is no historical argument that business records would fit -- would be exempted from the testimonial rule as a class. And, of course, this Court said in Crawford v. Washington that even if a State under a modern hearsay exception, whether it be a business-record rule or in the State of Massachusetts's case a special, brand-new hearsay rule -- just because that might be okay in the run-of-the-mill cases doesn't exempt it from the right to confrontation.",
  "Well, I think that is best characterized, with all due respect, as an argument for its reliability. And it may well be that judges and juries think that certain scientific processes yield more reliable results in terms of reports and testimony and assertions. But we think, again -- and this Court's decision in Crawford says quite strongly -- that a judge cannot decide just on the basis of reliability to exempt a given record or a class of records from the Confrontation Clause. And I think, Justice Kennedy, another analogy that makes it even more clear is police reports. Police reports, just like the lab report in this case, are -- are sworn documents created by public servants who are sworn to tell the truth, sworn to find evidence whether it exonerates, whether it incriminates, and to write up a report. And I don't think anyone has ever suggested that police reports describing a crime scene -- for example, no matter how objective the facts relayed, such as there is a blood stain on the carpet, there is -- the door was wide open when I got there - - those kinds of assertions would be exempted from the Confrontation Clause. It may well be that they are likely to be correct, that they are assertions of fact that can be verified, but we've never understood that to fall outside of the ambit of the Confrontation Clause.",
  "Well, I think if you had -- in contrast to this case, if you had a laboratory that was a private lab being used by the police, that would raise the question whether police agents who are private individuals but -- but asked by the police to create something like this, would generate testimonial evidence just as well. And I think the answer would be yes. In fact, in Davis this Court already addressed the situation, although it reserved in the footnote, but it assumed that the 911 operator in that case, who was a private individual working for a private company hired by the -- by the police - -",
  "Well, let me give you a few categories, Justice Scalia. There are six States, it is our understanding, including big populous States like California, Illinois and Georgia, that have no special hearsay law whatsoever, that bring in witnesses if defendants demand it. There is another category of States - -",
  "I'm sorry, I misspoke. I misspoke. That in the ordinary course need to bring in witnesses. Now, that was --getting ahead to my next - - my next category, there are at least nine or ten other States that have the kind of bland notice-and-demand regime that I was discussing with Justice Ginsburg. And so that's another category. And then you have -- since Crawford there is another, I believe, five additional States where their State supreme courts have held that Crawford applies to lab reports like this. So at least for the past couple of years they have been doing it the way that we would urge.",
  "That's what I meant to say if I didn't say it that way. Yes.",
  "They might, Justice Breyer, and I'd -- I'd be willing to assume for purposes of argument that they would. But to the extent that they would be offered by the prosecution in a criminal case, the fact that they were a business record would not answer the confrontation question as to whether - -",
  "Yes.",
  "I think I do, Justice - -",
  "But I do want to -- with all respect, I did want to add something to what you said about the rigors of the lab or of science. It may well be that those add to the truth, the reliability of reports. Let me say two things about that. First of all, the Confrontation Clause doesn't exempt bishops and nuns, or -- or anyone who we know or who we would think just as well would obviously be telling the truth. It's, again, for the defendant to decide and not for the court to decide whether cross-examination would be useful. But let me add to that, Justice Breyer, that the Innocence Project brief in this case and plenty of other sources widely available I think very, very, very persuasively explain that lab reports are not quite as reliable as we might want to think they are, and not - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, to the extent that is the prominent practice, it's one that grew up under this Court's Roberts jurisprudence.",
  "I think - -",
  "I understand.",
  "Yes, that -- that, again, it is -- it is not for the court; it's for the defendant to decide. We think the definition of \"testimonial\" generally speaking ought to be that when a document is prepared in contemplation of prosecution, or more specifically in this case to prove a fact that is an element of a criminal case, because that's what these reports say, then they should fall under the Confrontation Clause. And to the extent that these are in some realms and in some places reliable pieces of evidence, there is every reason to believe it's not going to cause any problem, because defendants aren't going to want to challenge them very often. If you look at the statistics in the law professors' brief, they say in States like California that -- first of all, we have a huge category of cases that go away in plea bargains. And then even within the category of cases that go to trial, it's 10 percent of the time or less - -",
  "Well, the best I can do to answer that, Mr. Chief Justice, is to say that empirically apparently that just doesn't happen. And I think the reason why is explained in some of the defense manuals that we have cited in our brief, which say that if your theory of the case has nothing to do with whether the scientific report being introduced by the prosecution is correct or not, very often the defense isn't going to do itself any favors by -- by insisting that that person take the stand, recite his credentials, recite the testing, and recite the damning evidence.",
  "No, I would very much resist that it will always be an empty exercise.",
  "Well, as I said, I think that through notice-and-demand regimes and stipulations, often that is not going to happen. But if it is achieved, what is achieved is the same thing that is achieved in any criminal trial where a defendant insists periodically that the prosecution be put to its proof. After all, we are talking about putting somebody away for many years in a typical - -",
  "I don't know of any empirical study where you might say what the price of this is. Of course, it happens already every day with other witnesses. You're going to have to bring in other witnesses, and this is one more witness. But again, even in a case where that's all that's going on, it's no different than all the other legal rights the defendant has.",
  "Remember, Justice Kennedy, that -- that if you look at the States where this exists, that's not what happens and that's not what we are insisting on. All we are insisting is that the prosecution in a case where the defendant demands it, whether it be through a notice and demand regime or whether it be because the prosecution simply calls the defense on the phone two weeks before trial and says, I'd like to do this through documentary evidence -- and then these repeat players remember who -- who -- one thing I think it's worth keeping in mind in all this, is that in the criminal justice system, by and large, especially in drug cases like this, we are talking about repeat players.",
  "I'm talking about the lawyers - -",
  "-- by and large, Your Honor. They have every -- they have incentives not to, as you might say, yank the chain of the other side.",
  "Not that I'm aware of. The best -- the best source that I believe exists is the Wigmore treatise, which both sides have cited. It says there was a shop-book rule that allowed shop-book ledgers and entries at the common law. But there is no -- there's no suggestion that that was - -",
  "It is a business records exception, but it's not an exception to the right to confrontation because no one would have considered ordinary business records created without contemplation of litigation to be -- to be testimonial evidence. What we have here - -",
  "I think all of the business records that were admissible at the time of the founding would have been nontestimonial.",
  "In a criminal case -- well, the typical regime -- and I'm going to assume that it exists at the time of founding, but you need some evidentiary rule to get a piece of evidence in in the first place, whether it be business records or whether it be just an ordinary rule of relevance. But, yes, they would have been admissible at the time of -- ordinary business record like a shop book would have been admissible at the time of the founding, but would have not raised a confrontation problem even in a criminal cause because it would have been nontestimonial.",
  "That's right, Justice Stevens. And you can you look at the Massachusetts own decisions. The State courts in Massachusetts already extended their rule in their day to ballistics tests, for example, which are notoriously unreliable in terms of empirical studies that have been -- that have been conducted about them. And my understanding -- I think you're right - - is that nothing in the Commonwealth's rule distinguishes one kind of forensic report from another. The United States is offering a slightly different analysis that appears to ask, to some degree, the degree of interpretation involved in a given forensic laboratory report. I don't know how you would administer that rule, but I can say that to whatever extent interpretation would be required, this is clearly on the interpretive side of the ledger. And again, if I could point the Court to a source for that, the Scientific Evidence treatise by Giannelli and Imwinkelried that the both parties cite at section 23.030(c) lays out the mass spectrometry way of testing for drugs that the Commonwealth tells you was the test used in this case and describes in great detail the amount of expertise, care, skill and interpretive methods that need to be brought in that kind of a test.",
  "The easiest answer in this case, Mr. Chief Justice, is it's required by Massachusetts law that -- that these tests be done in contemplation of prosecution. The law itself says that the police officer can give it to an analyst, and the analyst can certify a report if it's to be used for law enforcement purposes. So there is a statutory requirement. Now, you - -",
  "Well, to the degree it's not answer ed in this case by statute, undoubtedly this Court as it works through this jurisprudence will need to ask a question of common sense, whether the actors involved -- as this Court did in Davis -- whether the actors involved would understand what they are doing is creating evidence for a criminal case? If there are no more questions - -",
  "Okay. I'll reserve my time.",
  "To the extent that the prosecution wanted to introduce a report certifying a reporting result of a test, yes, it would be covered by ours.",
  "That would work to preserve the evidence in case the analyst became unavailable at the time of trial. And then under this Court's jurisprudence that deposition would be admissible.",
  "Then you -- then I don't think it would substitute for live testimony. But let me say one other way that this problem can be addressed by States is that they could have a supervisor take the stand and rely on raw data - - on raw data and give his or her explanation of raw data. It's just that the person cannot take the stand and relay somebody else's conclusion to the jury. And if there are no more questions, I'll reserve.",
  "Well, I think I go back, Your Honor, to looking at all the kinds of statements that this Court has looked at within the scope of the Confrontation Clause. This kind of public record, official record, laboratory report, has never been the subject of this kind of analysis and indeed it's not sufficient.",
  "But autopsy results -- my understanding, Your Honor, is that autopsy results - - again not a coroner's verdict, which -- in the reply brief we believe that counsel has conflated what would be a verdict between the fact of an official record, an autopsy report of the death, manner and means of death -- have been and still admissible.",
  "The difficulty with that, Justice Scalia, is I don't know of equivalent or comparable records that were being created at that time for purposes of litigation.",
  "Let me start, Your Honors: If there is any doubt remaining about the machine-generated theory that the Solicitor General was putting forward today, again I would refer the court back to the scientific evidence treatise. The raw data of a mass spectrometer looks - - looks something like a heart monitor. It's a printout of the squiggly line across the page that a person needs to look at and then analyze as to what it shows about the molecular composite of the substance that the machine was operating. We have no objection if prosecutors in criminal cases want to introduce machine generated data. They can do that. But what they can't do is introduce - - introduce affidavits certifying as to their -- you know, their interpretation of what a machine did or simply what a machine says, because there is no difference - -",
  "They could do that, Justice Scalia.",
  "Pardon me?",
  "My understanding of the common law on that, as the solicitor general put it, is that that was a foundational requirement that was not necessarily considered evidence.",
  "As a general matter, yes, our rule is consistent. Now, if you look at Wigmore, Wigmore - -",
  "I'm trying to answer. What Wigmore says is that something like a public recordkeeper's seal was not considered evidence, per se. It was a foundational requirement to put evidence in. And so, in this Court's words in the Dowdell case, it's something like a court reporter's transcript that goes up to a Court of Appeals and then is looked at. It's not considered evidence against a criminal defendant. Now, in stark contrast to this case where the document is expressly citing to a statute of Massachusetts law and saying this element of the criminal charge is satisfied. It is a very big difference.",
  "So long as chain of custody was satisfied, yes, Justice Kennedy, that someone could take the stand and do that. But remember, the reports in this case do not just report -- even if you accepted the solicitor's general's version that they are reporting what the machine said about the substance, they also have a paragraph before that, and this goes to Justice Scalia's question, say, these are -- these are the substances that were taken from the defendant in this case and given to me by this officer, and so, that is additional information that is being sworn to in the affidavit in this case that is also testimony.",
  "I think the defendant may have that right. I understood Justice Kennedy's hypothetical to suggest that that chain of custody was stipulated to or otherwise agreed.",
  "I did. So I think I'm - - here's what I'm saying.",
  "I think what we are doing here is disagreeing slightly over where chain of custody begins and ends. To the extent chain of custody gets you to the point at which the substance is put into the machine, and that was stipulated to or otherwise not thought about, then, yes, the printout could be introduced into evidence and anyone could testify as to what that printout means. But to the extent that there was a gap between the drugs getting into the laboratory and being put into the machine by somebody that the defendant was not stipulating to, then whoever did that -- if the State were going to assert this is who did it and this is the drugs that we had -- that would be something that would be subject to cross-examination.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think it's important at the outset to set the context for this case. The government cannot point to a single defendant under this provision for the conduct at issue who has ever received more than 10 years in prison absent the use of a machinegun. We cited a long string of cases in the O'Brien brief and the government's response in its reply brief was silent. So, therefore, the government is here today claiming that it is entitled, based on the fact of a machinegun, to get 20 years more than any defendant that perpetrated this conduct has ever gotten, and indeed 18 more years than the government itself asked the district judge in this case for, once the machinegun provision was off the table, under the guise that this is nothing more than a sentencing factor. We think that this Court's statutory interpretation jurisprudence as well, if necessary, this Court's constitutional jurisprudence foreclose such a result. Let me start with statutory interpretation. On the government's theory in 1998, Congress stepped in and took a statute that made machinegun use an element and transformed it into -- into a sentencing factor. In other words, Congress, without a peep, a mutter, or anything, and in -- in the course of doing something entirely different, which was reacting to this Court's Bailey decision, stepped in and took a fact that formerly had to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt to trigger a 30-year sentence and left that same sentence in place but now allowed it to be proved to a judge by a preponderance, based on a presentence report, and, indeed, according to the government, also stripped away the mens rea requirement that attached to the statute when it was an element.",
  "We think, Justice Ginsburg, that if this Court had to construe that statute in a different case, that provision, it would find it's still an element. Now, I grant that it’s a difference, a very significant difference between 10 and 30 years, but structurally it is an element. And I think an -- a good way to go about understanding this -- I heard my -- my opponent today say that this would be indistinguishable from Harris or fly in the face of Harris. Well, there's three very important differences between the machinegun provision at issue here and the discharge provision in Dean and the brandishing provision in Harris. The first difference is that this an entirely separate subparagraph. Now, if you imagine somebody amending the statute and wanting to accomplish what the government says was accomplished here, why wouldn't the firearm type provisions just have been (iv) and (v) under capital letter (A)? They’re not. What the draftsperson did instead is break them out into an entirely separate, stand-alone provision. As the AUSA described it, when he charged them in the alternative in the district of Massachusetts, he said I think it's a greater and lesser offense situation. And that's what we think.",
  "I don't understand that to be what the government has said. I believe the government's argument is that the big paragraph with capital letter (A) sets forth the elements, and then sub (i), (ii), and (iii) are merely sentencing factors.",
  "That's right. That's right, Justice Ginsburg.",
  "So what sub (B) does, as I said, is it creates a greater offense, and so, it’s broken out in a way that incorporates the earlier elements up above in the main paragraph by using the phrase: If a “firearm possessed by a person convicted of a violation of this subsection.” That phrase, we believe, incorporates the earlier elements. Remember in Harris this Court emphasized that the brandishing provision just kept going in the sentence and did not incorporate earlier elements. So when the government stands here today and says, well, when you incorporate the earlier elements, that shows it’s a sentencing factor, too, it seems to me a situation of heads, I win; tails, you lose.",
  "Right. And let me -- let me give two responses to that. First of all, if you -- if you look again at the appendix of the government's main brief, which is 1a and 2a, the guts of the statute is the “use or carry” language or “possesses a firearm” language in the main paragraph. And then, the -- from the “possessed” language down through sub (iii), what you have is the Bailey fix right there. So, then what happens --",
  "I don't think that’s necessarily the case, Justice Scalia. This Court --",
  "-- has said a couple of times that this is a theoretical maximum sentence, but, surely, if nothing else, the Sentencing Reform Act sets a maximum sentence here if it's not just a straight determinant sentence. And we've argued at length in the O'Brien brief that the reasonableness requirement under 3553 of sentence. And for the reason I said at the outset, given that no one has ever received more than 10 years absent a machinegun here, certainly that maximum sentence would be far less than life and far less than 30 years. But --",
  "Let me answer it --",
  "If I might say one more --",
  "If I might say one more sentence to Justice Breyer, and then I’ll answer that.",
  "Justice Breyer, the other thing I'd point out is that, so therefore, once you make the Bailey fix, you just come -- in the old statute, then you come to the machinegun provision, and you just leave it where it was. And, in fact, there are plenty of statutes that we’ve cited in both briefs where there are elements in the middle, sandwiched between sentencing factors. Now, Justice Kennedy, you asked the general principle. The general principle is this, at least in terms of this Court's Sixth Amendment law, is that: The critical question to ask is whether the defendant could receive the sentence the government seeks without the fact at issue. Seven years is a sentence the defendant here could receive without the machinegun finding. Thirty years is absolutely off bounds.",
  "There is both, Your Honor. Of course, the guidelines are not binding --",
  "-- but the guideline sentences as -- as to this statute are pegged exactly to the mandatory minimums.",
  "Under the facts that either we prove to the jury or are admitted by the defendant. So -- so in this case, the defendant could receive 7 years, and we've conceded that.",
  "Oh, certainly, Justice Scalia.",
  "Seven years comes from -- comes from the statute, for brandishing, which is what both defendants had admitted that they did. Seven years --",
  "But they've admitted it. So they've waived any Sixth Amendment right as to that sentencing factor. We're willing to concede that. But then you go to the guidelines, which sets a 7-year -- a 7-year recommended sentence. Under this Court's jurisprudence following Booker, we know that we take that recommendation and we plug it into section 3553(a), which, if you want the statutory language, directs that a sentence “no greater than necessary to serve the following factors” be introduced -- I'm sorry, be imposed. And when you look at those factors, disparity is a factor this Court has left in place and emphasized at every term since Booker, and the guideline sentence. And when you put -- plug those things into the facts here, we simply suggest there is no way that it would be upheld as substantively reasonable if the defendant got 30 years absent the machinegun fact here. And we’ve also cited in our brief several places where the government itself makes this -- the mirror image of the argument that I'm making in the post-Booker, Gall, Rita world, when judges deviate downward from the guidelines. They emphasize -- we quoted one Eleventh Circuit case in our brief where the government got overturned, as substantively unreasonable, a downward variance from a guideline recommendation, because no defendant had ever received such a low sentence. But I don't have to, of course, hang my hat on this -- on the strict application of Apprendi here. We think there's also an even deeper problem that predates this Court's Apprendi jurisprudence, which was flagged by this Court as early as McMillan, where this Court said that if what Congress does is step in and manipulate the elements of a crime in order to relieve the government of its obligation to prove ordinary and traditional elements, then we have a pure due process problem, irrespective of any Sixth Amendment problem. Now, this Court has never found such a problem, but I would emphasize that the --",
  "How do we find substantively unreasonable after Booker?",
  "Well, if you’re asking me the question -- I want to be sure I understand and answer the question. If you’re asking me how applying the principle this Court first articulated in McMillan, and you apply it here --",
  "I don't think you have to look any further -- well, there is two places you can look. You can look both at the intent of Congress and the effect of what it did. The intent of Congress, at least as hypothesized by the Solicitor General, is laid out at page 33 of its merits brief, where it says: What Congress was intending to do here is, quote, \"simplify and streamline guilt-stage proceedings\" by relieving the government of its burden to prove this case -- this fact beyond a reasonable doubt to the judge. So that strikes one as, as this Court put it in Harris, an intent to evade the ordinary requirements in the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Then, as to effect, you can look at what I've also -- what I've already emphasized, which is that this sentence simply is not otherwise available, absent that fact. And that, on its own, ought to tell this Court that it's dealing with an element. But if it wants to dig even deeper, it could -- it could describe it in terms of a 20-year increase over what the defendant would otherwise get or what, indeed, as we’ve said, anyone has ever gotten for this act, absent a machinegun. It could do it in terms of percentage \"tail wagging the dog.\" I don't think it matters exactly what exact avenue this Court would pick. Again, if it were doing a constitutional analysis -- I’m speaking right now constitutionally instead of statutorily -- it would all end up at the same place. But I want to make sure that I understood your question also, with due respect to you, Justice Ginsburg, because what I was talking about was 10 years under (A)(iii), of course, is a sentencing factor, as this Court held in Dean, whereas under (B)(i), the same length of a sentence might be an element. That was a matter -- that was a statutory answer, and I think, as a matter of statutory construction, which is, of course, the first thing you're going to address in this case, what we think we can win on without even reaching the constitutional questions. And the differences would be, apart from the same sentence, you have the structural difference that I've emphasized. You have the tradition. And let me say a word about tradition, if I might. The government emphasizes the guidelines and other kinds of statutes. When this Court applies the tradition canon that it established in Almendarez-Torres and Castillo, I don't know why you have to look any further than Castillo itself to answer the tradition question. In Jones, as this Court put it, the reason we look to tradition is because if it's a close case, we’re going to not assume that Congress intended a radical departure from past practice. Well, the past practice here is absolutely unequivocal. This Court held in Castillo, 9-0, that Congress intended this to be an element.",
  "I don't contend that Castillo absolutely decides the case. My contention that I was trying to make is that when this Court looks to tradition for purposes of construing the new amendments, that Castillo gives the answer on -- at least on tradition, at least as applying that particular question. Because Congress, we know, intended it to be an element at least until 1998. But I think that even -- even if you were to step back from the Castillo analysis itself and the Castillo factors themselves, you would also, I think, do well to give -- again, not dispositive, but -- but careful treatment to Castillo, because Congress steps in, of course, and amends statutes all the time. They step in and they amend one portion of a statute, and while they are at it, we know from the manuals that we've cited and from the examples in the back of the O'Brien brief that Congress often, while they’re amending one part, they reorganize or reword other parts of the statute. And this Court, across its statutory interpretation jurisprudence, within criminal law and outside, has always said that once we say the law means something, we're not going to assume that Congress changed the law unless we get some sort of clear indication from Congress that it -- that it intended to change the law. Now, here, as I think has been emphasized, but I’ll just reiterate, there’s not a peep of anything in the legislative history or anything to suggest that Congress was -- was intending to change the law here. And, in fact, it's not even a mere silence case. We know quite clearly and affirmatively that Congress was intending to do something entirely different, which was respond to this Court's Bailey decision. But even in the language -- and the only thing I think the Solicitor General even has for it in this case is the language and structure, which are some different words and different placement that it can at least build an argument off of, because the other four of the five Castillo factors are entirely unchanged. But even the language, we submit, is a far cry from the kind of change this Court ought to require before it does a 180-degree switch as to what it had said the prior law meant. Just for purposes of stability in the law, if nothing else, I think this -- it behooves this Court to take its prior decisions seriously and to -- and to engage in a dialogue with Congress that encourages Congress to be clear when it wants to change what the prior law is.",
  "They -- as you say, they were not in the statute itself. My understanding is that judges as -- on an ad hoc basis, would have treated those as sentencing factors. And what Congress did -- when it came in to respond to this Court's Bailey decision, I think it codified all of the different manners of using the gun in the context of one of these crimes. So it not just dealt with, yes, possessing ought to be covered, but it talked about other manners, brandishing and discharging. In Castillo, this Court emphasized again the big difference between manner of using a gun and the type of firearm which lies at the core of this offense. If I would turn -- if I would leave the Court with nothing else, let me emphasize again to the Court the difference between this statute, which I think the government wants you to think is no different in intent, effect, or operation than the two that this Court prior -- dealt with in Harris, as a matter of both statutory construction and constitutional law, and in McMillan, as a matter of constitutional law. What this Court emphasized in both of those cases was that there was a preexisting law on the books that criminalized certain activity. And then a legislature later stepped in and set a mandatory minimum for a particular fact that could accompany the crime at issue. And it did so in a very minor way. For example, in Pennsylvania, the various crimes covered by the firearm mandatory minimum in that case gave 10-, 20-year sentences routinely, and all the Pennsylvania legislature did was step in and say: If he uses a gun, we want at least 5 years. And in Harris, as I've just emphasized, I think, in discussing with Justice Scalia, the Court dealt with a bump of just 2 years. Again, what judges were already customarily doing, I think, under the statute. Here, this is entirely and dramatically different. Here, the fact allows a sentence -- indeed, requires a sentence -- that is 20 years longer than anyone has ever gotten for this conduct at issue. That is a difference not just -- it's not a minor difference. It is a categorically different difference that we think is enough, combined with other principles of statutory and constitutional interpretation, to -- I'm sorry, statutory interpretation to resolve this case on the statute alone. But if you need to look to the Constitution, we think that the Sixth Amendment, either as the bright-line rule articulated in Apprendi dictates that any fact that allows a greater sentence than the defendant could otherwise receive is subject to the Sixth Amendment, or sort of plain, pure due process, tail-that-wags-the-dog analysis, that this Court emphasized in McMillan -- either of those would be unconstitutionality here and a finding this Court can avoid. And if nothing else, Justice Breyer, I would say that we think that this case can be resolved on statutory grounds. We think there are narrower constitutional arguments that would either require reading it narrowly or striking it down if you had to, on even narrower grounds. But if nothing else, then we would ask this Court to revisit Harris, if necessary. We don't think it's necessary to resolve the case for us here, but we think that would be appropriate if it -- if it needed to get there.",
  "I assume so, but I don't know the specific answer to that, Justice Kennedy. What there is a dispute about, of course, is whether the -- if it were a sentencing factor, whether the government has to prove knowledge. And we do emphasize that that would be an alternative basis for this Court to decide this case, by saying you at least have to prove knowledge even if it’s a sentencing factor. And let me just leave you with this, unless there are any further questions: The government makes a couple points in its reply brief suggesting that certain arguments were not preserved or made properly in this case. The knowledge argument that I just referred to is raised in the brief in opposition for Mr. O'Brien at pages 23 to 25. So under rule 15 of this Court, that argument was properly presented at the cert stage. You will also find that argument at pages 34 to 37 of the Joint Appendix. Also with respect to the Sixth Amendment substantive reasonableness as-applied argument, the government suggests that for some reason, that would be inappropriate for this Court to reach or rely on. Again, we disagree. First of all, we can't understand why it would be inappropriate to reach or rely on that constitutional argument, whereas it is apparently appropriate for this Court to address the McMillan argument or the “overrule Harris” argument. They’re all three constitutional arguments that are present in this case. And, again, if there were any doubt they were raised below, pages 38 and 39 of Mr. Burgess's First Circuit brief, pages 32 to 35 of Mr. O'Brien's First Circuit brief, and in the brief in opposition, which the government, in its reply brief at the cert stage, responded to without claiming any error or any waiver problems. So we think absolutely all the arguments that are made in the blue -- in the red briefs are clearly before you. If the Court has any additional questions, I would be happy to entertain them. Otherwise, I am prepared to submit the case.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A habeas petition challenging a new State court judgment for the first time cannot be a second or successive petition. AEDPA, of course, is a highly complex statutory system that has many interdependent parts. The pivotal language of this case, section 2244, is reproduced at page 2 of the blue brief, of Petitioner's brief. What that section does is it restricts claims that can be brought in, quote, \"a second or successive habeas corpus application\" under section 2254. So this text establishes a two-step framework. First, the court needs to decide whether it's dealing with a second or successive petition. And second, if it is and only if it is, then the Court applies the modified res judicata principles set forth in that section. Now, this case involves only the first of those two steps. And a petition, as here, that challenges a new death sentence cannot be a second or successive petition for the very simple reason that it challenges a State court judgment that has no -- never been covered in a habeas petition before.",
  "But, Justice Alito, let me make clear how we get to incorporating judgment and then answer your question. The way that you incorporate the word \"judgment\" is because, again, the language I just quoted says \"an application under section 2244.\" And section 2244 defines -- and this is at the bottom of the page, of page 2 -­",
  "-- defines it as \"seeking relief from a State court judgment.\" Now, you are right that -- that -- that if somebody receives relief only as to their sentence and gets a new death sentence, as in this case, that the judgment he is challenging is new only as to the sentence. Now, there -- the word \"judgment\" appears in other places in the U.S. Code. There is two other places I am aware of where this Court had to construe the word \"judgment.\" One of them is when this -- is with respect to this Court's jurisdiction over final State court judgments. And in that realm -- this is in Brady v. Maryland in footnote 1 it's laid out. In that realm, this Court treats the judgment as having two parts that can be final -­",
  "That's right.",
  "That's right. And in Burton this Court made it very clear that the judgment that he's being held in custody as to is the new judgment that he is challenging. Now, what I'm saying is in the Brady context this Court has treated judgment as having two parts that can be final as to one and not as to the other. In other contexts in Burton, for purposes of seeking an appeal or seeking habeas relief, it is treated as inseparable. And the common thread between those two circumstances has been what minimizes Federal intrusion on State affairs? And so in this context that's a very easy answer, because what this Court always assumed, and correctly so, I believe, is that if the only thing that is unconstitutional is somebody's sentence, that's the only thing a Federal court has the power to invalidate. And that's the only thing -­",
  "Well, I don't know, Mr. Chief Justice, that that question could actually arise in a section 2254 case, where the only thing a Federal court has power to do is to declare one way or the other whether the sentence is constitutional or not and then leave it to the State to decide in further proceedings how to -- how to go forward. In the Federal context in section 2255, the question you suggest might arise, and indeed it has in a few places. And the question that the Federal courts have asked themselves in the second habeas petition, the second in time habeas petition, is the -- is the Petitioner challenging something he lost on the first time? And if the answer to that is yes, then it's a successive petition.",
  "If he's challenging -­",
  "No, Justice Alito. I think there are two textual bases. The first is the word \"judgment\" and, as I've described, sometimes this Court treats the judgment as having two parts that can be divided, and sometimes it doesn't. I think in this context it ought to treat them as able to be divided. The other place you look is the words \"second\" -­",
  "Correct.",
  "Well, certainly it has -­",
  "He is being held in custody until he is executed, certainly, under his conviction. But his death sentence -- and in habeas -- in habeas it's always been understood you can challenge not just the fact of your custody, but the terms under which your custody -­",
  "So I think the death sentence here is most easily thought of as the terms of the custody, which is a separate thing that he challenged and won on the first time and is challenging again now.",
  "Well, I think that because -­ what we're we are really talking about here when we talk about death eligibility is the need to find an aggravating circumstance. And here that goes only to whether -- his penalty, what his penalty can be. It's only to whether he can receive the death sentence or not. So it goes solely to punishment, not to crime. Now, Justice Alito, on -­",
  "The first conviction enabled him -- if we put aside for the moment our substantive fight over whether or not the crime itself constitutes an aggravating circumstance, but the conviction itself carries a life sentence unless an aggravating circumstance is found. And so put -- put it this way, Justice Kennedy: After the Eleventh Circuit granted habeas relief the first time, Mr. Magwood at that moment, in 1986, was subject to a conviction that carried a life sentence. And it was the State that elected to go forward at that point and to seek a new death sentence. And all our position is, is that when that brandnew full-blown sentencing hearing was held -­ and the Alabama trial court at Pet App. 103a called this a \"complete and new assessment of the evidence and the law\" -- when this new hearing was held it had to comport with the Constitution. I don't think even the State disputes that all the -- all parts of the Constitution applied in that context.",
  "And so -­",
  "Because that order was entered in one case, and now we have an entirely different case, Justice Ginsburg. That order was entered in the case under which Mr. Magwood challenged his 1981 judgment.",
  "Well, it's not -- it was not claim he could have brought, and this is an important point, Justice Ginsburg. Under res judicata law, he is not making, as the State would say, the same claim now as he could have made then. The fact that he is challenging a different judgment by definition makes it a new -­",
  "That's right. The legal -- the legal issue that he is raising is one that he could have raised then.",
  "Because you can't waive something by failing to raise it in a different case. This is an entirely different case, in the district court -­",
  "So let me answer that in practical terms and then get back to Justice Alito by giving a -- giving statutory hook for it. In practical terms, even though the new judgment, which is at Pet. App. 106a, reimposes the conviction, it's not anything new as to that conviction. If it were a new judgment as to that conviction, the State of Alabama would have to have a whole new trial on guilt/innocence, and it didn't.",
  "Pardon me?",
  "It is new because of the brandnew sentence, Your Honor.",
  "Well, it's -­",
  "-- they imposed -­",
  "No, it doesn't. Look at this Court's decision in Lawlor. This is discussed in our opening brief, I believe around page 23, and it's a res judicata case. And what the Court held in that case is if somebody does something to somebody, the exact same thing multiple times, you can bring a new case when they do it to you the second time or the third time, and you can make arguments that were never made the first time. There is no waiver, there is no forfeiture, and the reason you can do it is you are challenging a new injury. So Mr. Magwood under -- even under res judicata law, which this Court has said is stricter than habeas law, even under res judicata law he would have the right to bring this claim as to the sentence because it's challenging something new. Now let me get back to the statute, because this is important. The other place that we get our -­ our answer is the word -­",
  "With all due respect, I think Lawlor does apply. One example in that case is an abatable nuisance. Imagine that smoke goes over and pollutes somebody's property every -- every first day of January every year. Somebody brings a lawsuit about that saying it violates certain laws, and they lose. If the next year smoke goes over the property again, you can bring a lawsuit for the identical thing.",
  "Fair enough. Well, same -­ same here. The first case Mr. Magwood brought was about the 1981 judgment sentencing him to death, and this case is about the 1986.",
  "But remember, the act -­",
  "But all we are talking about here is not the same act. The same act as to the conviction carries over, but this was, as the trial court put it, a complete and new assessment of the evidence. This second -­",
  "Well, the trial judge -­",
  "As it turns out, the parties did not put new witnesses on the stand. But the trial judge was explicit -- and this is in the -- in the order that's in the back of the appendix -- it was explicit that the parties had the right to do that.",
  "They had every right -­",
  "Because death eligibility hinges on the finding of an aggravating circumstance. And so that was vacated when the -- when the -- when the State elected to go forward and tried to reimpose a death sentence and the -- reimpose a new death sentence and the trial judge found new -- it turned out to be the same aggravating circumstance, but it found an aggravating circumstance all over again. Imagine, Justice Kennedy, the State if it had wanted to at the second death sentence hearing could have submitted evidence to try to prove a new aggravating circumstance. The defendants could have submitted evidence trying to prove new mitigating circumstances. Now, Mr. -- Justice Alito, I think it's important to get back to your question for the second actual hook for my argument, and it's the words \"second or successive.\" It has to -- in some way to make any sense of the statute, you have to say it's second or successive as to something. Now, if you look at McCleskey, which is this Court's most thorough consideration of that concept, it says again and again in that decision what makes it second or successive is that you are asking for the same thing you have been denied before. You are coming back, as -- as -- as it used to be the case, you are filing, in effect, an appeal, endless appeals from the denials that you have been getting. We are giving meaning to \"second or successive\" by saying that it's second or successive if you are asking for relief that has been denied before. It is not second or successive if it's the first time you are challenging something new that the State's imposed.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I'm going to tell you two things. First of all, with -- with respect to the two different claims, given the severity of Mr. Magwood's mental illness, I think there was every reason to expect that prevailing on that claim in the Eleventh Circuit would have put an end to the State's decision to seek the death penalty in this case. As it turns out, it didn't and the State went forward. But also understand that the State's argument here, to the extent you are ordering the claims in sort of a level of importance, would apply even if the opposite were true, even if Mr. Magwood had brought the -- had brought some other claim the first time and prevailed on it. Any claim, the State says, that you could have raised the first time is forever barred. And that gets to, well, I still don't think I have quite answered the question on second or successive, so let me continue that. We are giving meaning to that term \"second or successive.\" It's important to understand that, whatever slight difficulty you have with the word \"judgment\" and making sense of the words \"second or successive\" in our case are dwarfed by the interpretive difficulties, in fact the impossibilities, with respect to the State's proposal. The State's proposal -- and it's laid out at page 17 of its brief, at the top of the page, right after the number 1 -- the State's proposed rule -- and I think it's useful to put it next to the statute. The State's proposed rule is if a claim could have been or was raised in a prior petition, it is barred by Section 2244 (2) or (1). Now, the first thing you will notice is that the words \"second or successive\" appear nowhere in the State's rule. The State gives no definition, no meaning whatsoever, to those concepts. What the State is trying to do is -- is ask this Court to create a brandnew waiver system, a brandnew waiver system for all second in time petitions. And we know -- we know from Martinez-Villareal and Slack and other cases that second in time petitions are not necessarily successive and certainly they ought not to be thought of as successive when they challenge a different judgment or a different conviction or the like. But what the State is asking for is a brandnew waiver system that has never been imposed in any decision from this Court and there have been three decisions from this Court where it would have come up. One is Burton, another is Richmond, which is cited in our brief, and the third case is -­",
  "Because the only way to get the idea of second or successive into the State's definition is where it says prior habeas petition. So, the only way that a State can even be pretending to give meaning to that would be a second in time petition. Now, we know that can't be enough because of Slack and Martinez-Villareal. But even more than that, we know that can't be enough because it would -- it would prohibit defendants from bringing second habeas petitions even as to things that are novel as to -- a second in time rule would apply section 2244's rules to even second in time petitions that are brandnew things that arose at the retrial or resentencing.",
  "That's right, Justice Kennedy. So the State creates additional statutory language that doesn't exist. It could have been or a previously available rule. Let me give you some -­",
  "I disagree, Mr. Chief Justice. You do look at those questions once it has been determined that a petition is second or successive. You have never looked at those questions in order to determine somehow whether it gets in the door.",
  "Well, I can tell you lots of reasons why that would be the case. So, let me give you some examples.",
  "The word -­",
  "Because the word the statute used, Justice Scalia, is \"claim,\" not issue. And this is not the same claim.",
  "Lawlor tells you that, and res judicata.",
  "Well, it refers to section 2254, and section 2254 uses the word \"judgment,\" so it's our belief it is by incorporation. But to get back to your precise question, it's important because the statute does not use the words \"issue\" or \"argument.\" It uses the word \"claim,\" which is a defined term in legal parlance.",
  "But, Justice Scalia, this is not the second time this claim could have been presented. In 1983 or '84 when he filed his first habeas petition, he couldn't make this claim because this judgment didn't even exist. There would be no way to challenge this judgment. And I'm not being overly technical here. I just urge you to look at res judicata law. Now let me give you some examples of the difficulties the State system would raise. First of all, with -- with respect to intervening authority. The State itself concedes in its brief that it's not clear how its system would apply in the case of somebody who gets habeas relief and then later wants to seek habeas relief based on an intervening decision of this Court. Up until now that has been a perfectly easy situation because the new judgment allows a new claim to be brought, but under the State's rule it's unclear. To the extent that the State says, well, what we would have to do is look and see -- look and see whether if there was fair notice of that decision, the defendant would have raised it. That gets into very difficult situations about how new is the decision.",
  "But that's not the State's rule, Mr. Chief Justice. It's very easy to say whether this Court has made a decision retroactive. It would be. It hasn't happened, but I imagine it would be very easy. The State's rule is any new decision from this Court gives the defendant a new -- gives potential rise to a debate as to whether or not that claim was previously available. Let me tick off a couple of other things before I sit down. What about a situation the first time where a claim is Teague-barred or procedurally precluded or maybe even the defendant doesn't raise it because under the facts that the first trial went forward, it would have been harmless error. All of those situations would raise very difficult questions as to whether that claim, as the State would put it, was previously available. Even, again, go back to the idea of having a new trial based on new -- based on new facts and new evidence. Trying to figure out whether it's the same claim, a different claim; imagine a claim based on a prosecutor's closing argument. Well, unless the prosecutor reads the exact same script a second time, there is going to be a huge fight over whether it's a new claim, an old claim, a different claim. And finally, the State's other -- the other prong of the State's test is about claims that were raised before are now barred. Now, the State immediately recognizes that that's a huge problem because it would bar defendants from making -- from seeking habeas relief if the State made the same violation the second time around. So it invents a brand-new due process principle that has never been held to be -- to be in existence by this Court. And indeed, in the Penry case, where this Court dealt with the Texas situation, where the State court made the same error twice, it went straight to the constitutional claim.",
  "Well, it -- well, it shouldn't be barred. Because it's a new judgment, the defendant should be able to get relief the second time around. It would be a very strange construction of the habeas statute, and it wouldn't be law of the case because it would be a new case, again, Justice Kennedy. And finally, let me give you the situation of claims the defendant raises but then loses on but is unable to appeal. Imagine a case like this where the defendant has many other claims that he loses on in the district court or in the court of appeals. Now, the State has a pickle here. It has to either say that those claims are forever barred from being raised again, even though the defendant was deprived of a full right to appeal because he won on something else and couldn't appeal the losses on the other issues, or the State has to say that those were -- that those were not previously available, those claims were not previously available, in which all of its rhetoric about resurrecting past claims drops away. Again, a very difficult question that this Court's going to have to grapple with if it accepts the State's rule. I would like to reserve what time I have left.",
  "Right.",
  "Thank you. Let me make two points, Your Honor. If I leave you with nothing else, think about the argument that you just heard that again and again talks about abuse of the writ, abuse of the writ, abuse of the writ. Well, there is now a statute that occupies this field, it's section 2254. And abuse of the writ principles apply only if a petition is second or successive. So if this Court does nothing else, it has to define that term, and we are the only ones who have given you a definition of second or successive. And Congress made that decision for a reason. It thought it was fair to impose strict burdens oh relitigation to the extent that the defendant lost. But when he wins, and gets a brand-new trial or a brand-new sentencing hearing -­",
  "Pardon me?",
  "Yes.",
  "Probably not. But let me tell you, Justice Sotomayor, that question can arise only in a Federal situation. It cannot arise under section 2244 which gets to the other important point I wanted to make. The State keeps talking about what the district court said. Well, when the State -- when this case went to the Eleventh Circuit the first time, the State made it very clear. It complained, it said the district court can't remand this to the State courts, it can't micromanage what a State court does. All it can do -- and, Justice Scalia, this is, I think, most clearly put in your Wilkinson concurrence is order the release or not. The Federal court in this case ordered Magwood's release from the death penalty unless the defendant -- unless the State wanted to elect to have a brandnew sentencing proceeding. Now, the State elected to do that, and had every right to do it. But Magwood also had every right to insist on every constitutional protection in that circumstance. And if I might finish this sentence, Mr. Chief Justice, when he -- we agreed if that Mr. Magwood had not properly preserved this argument the second time around, it would be procedurally defaulted. And if the State wants to make that argument on remand, it can. But understand that the State's argument is asking you to say that a claim is barred from Federal habeas even if the defendant completely properly raises it the second time around and loses it and wants to then bring it to the Federal courts.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Before turning to the substance, I would like to, if I may, start with the procedural question that Justice Sotomayor raised and that -- and that my opponent just completed with, because I want to be sure there's no confusion on the posture of this case. In particular, this Court's precedents squarely reject the notion that there's any history in this Court's precedents for refusing to reach an argument in this posture. In particular, in Langness v. Green, 282 U.S. 531, this Court held in 1931 that a Respondent's, quote, \"right\" to defend a judgment below on a ground that is properly preserved all along and that the lower court reached and rejected is, quote, \"beyond successful challenge.\" Now, I'm not sure -- I'm not aware of any exception from that rule in the 80 years since.",
  "Well, I'll take your hypothetical, Justice Alito, but I do want to be able to correct the notion that it's of no longer continuing importance. But I'll assume that your hypothetical on that kind of a question would be cert denied. But that's never been an obstacle to reaching the question. Let me give you two things that are very important here. The first is the problem with the Government's citation to Nobles is not just a distinction between discretion and law. If you look at the Solicitor General's own reply brief in that case, it pointed out that the problem with the alternative argument there was that it would give the defendant different relief. So it was therefore subject to the cross-petitions rule, and that's the section in Stern and Gressman that's cited in their brief. Those are the only two citations they have, the citations to Nobles and the citations to Stern and Gressman, which are all about cross-petitions when the defendant wants different relief. We want exactly the same relief. We want a dismissal on the Speedy Trial Act. So finally, even if it were somehow discretionary and this Court were to consider in this case breaking from its unbroken precedent of 80 years -­ let me give you one more example before I turn to the discretionary. In the Walling case in 1947, this Court reached as an alternative ground the defendant's argument that there was insufficient evidence. Now, that's sort of the quintessential un-cert-worthy question, but this Court felt required to reach it because the lower court had reached it and rejected it and the defendant had preserved it all along in that case. And in the Union Pacific case in 2009 -- I can keep giving you citations. But let me just say, even if it were discretionary, you would still want to reach it in this case, because at pages 18 and 19 of the Solicitor General's brief there are citations to a circuit split on this issue. And the new Rule 45 hasn't made that go away for two reasons. The first is because the Solicitor General's own argument now doesn't depend on Rule 45. Instead, it's that the Speedy Trial Act on its own terms counts 10 business days, not simply calendar days. And, second, there continue to be decisions after the amendment of Rule 45 in which lower courts have said that this provision means only 10 business days. Let me give you one more citation, and forgive me for this because we didn't get to file a reply brief in this case on this issue. But the Zabawa case, 2010 Westlaw, 307-5044, is a case in the Eastern District of Michigan last summer where the Government's own filing, which we looked at on PACER, asked the court to apply Tinklenberg and hold that subsection (F) meant only ten business days.",
  "You're not duty-bound to decide it, Justice Alito. But I do think under this Court's precedent, at least, you have never reversed the decision below without reaching them. So you may well affirm on the question presented or some one or two of those questions. You may also dismiss the case as improvidently granted, which happens sometimes in these circumstances. Of course, what ordinarily what would happen is when the cert -- when the ops was filed this Court would realize there was a serious obstacle to reaching the question and might well deny cert in the first place. But as I said, there's no decision on this Court's books and certainly the Solicitor General hasn't appointed one where you've reversed and reinstated a conviction or, in fact, reversed and done anything to a Respondent in these circumstances. Now, let me turn to the merits of the ten day argument and make a few points before I'm sure the Court might want to talk about the pretrial motions issue as well. There's a few important points to make. Now, remember, the Solicitor General has now basically abandoned the Sixth Circuit's view that Rule 45 automatically gets incorporated into the Speedy Trial Act and now they're making the making the argument that what Congress intended in the Speedy Trial Act was somehow for Rule 45 to operate as some background principle. So that the meaning of the Act, I guess, would wax and wane according to what Rule 45 said. Now, there's two versions of this argument. I can't tell which it's making. First it could be saying that what Congress meant when it passed subsection F in 1979 was that whatever the rule is in Rule 45 right now, that's what we expect to be applied. Well, that can't possibly be the Solicitor General's argument because in 1979 Rule 45, consistent with the traditional rule, excluded weekends and holidays only for periods of less than seven days. That wasn't changed until 1985. So the Congress at the time, even if they had cared about Rule 45, wouldn't have, wouldn't have thought you counted, excluded weekends and holidays here.",
  "I think the much more natural reading, Justice Ginsburg, in light of the traditional rule, which is not just cited in Am. Jur., please understand, this is a cannon of common law, traditional construction of time periods that goes back to Sutherland's treatise in 1904. There's a Second Circuit case called Morasca in 1921, 277 F.2727, I could cite you 20 or 30 state cases all up and down the last century. So the common law rule has always been for periods of less than seven days -- I'm sorry, for periods of more than seven days, it's up to the legislature to expressly tell the court to exclude weekends and holidays. And if you look at the U.S. Code, it's perfectly consistent with that common law understanding because when Congress wanted, such as in the Bail Reform Act, to exclude weekends and holidays from a ten day period, it expressly says so. Now, we cited three or four examples in our brief. Again, this is at page 40, 41 of our brief. I could have cited 15 or 20. So the U.S. Code is quite clear and I think the much more natural inference its that when Congress wanted to exclude weekends and holidays consistent with the traditional rule, it felt duty bound to say so in the U.S. Code, and when it hasn't, it wants simply calendar days -- now, if you want confirmation.",
  "It does now, but two things are telling about the 2009 amendments. The first is that when it switched to statutes, it reverted to counting calendar days.",
  "No.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's right, that's right. But if you want to talk about Congressional intent, I don't think we have to even go there. But, remember, after the -- in 2009 there's also a Federal law, the Technical Amendments Statutory Act made a hash of that. But Congress went through, most recently about a year and a half ago, and amended various provisions of the U.S. Code according to whether it wanted weekends or holidays excluded or times enlarged, and it left this alone. So I think every indicia of evidence you can look at from every possible angle shows that ten days meant ten days at the time of the trial, and that's not to affirm the judgment. The last point I'll make concerning -­",
  "No, my point, Justice Alito, is Congress didn't think of the Speedy Trial Act, it didn't do anything with the Speedy Trial Act.",
  "Well, maybe we leave that where it was, but let me make one final point that I think is the clincher here. Remember, we have not just this alternative argument, we have a second alternative argument, which is that the time in relation to Mr. Tinklenberg's competency hearing exceeded the 30 day provision in section 4247 in the Insanity Defense Reform Act. Now, I don't think you have to get to that argument, you can simply affirm on the ten day issue, but, again, let's think about what the Solicitor General is arguing with respect to the ten day issue. They're saying that Congress sub silentio, without saying anything at all in the Speedy Trial Act, somehow assumed that the time in subsection F would wax and wane according to this rule. Well, if that's -- even though the rule didn't even apply to statutes at the time. Well, if that's the case, then I don't think there's any basis for arguing that Congress would have had exactly the same assumption with respect to another Federal statute, that is the Insanity Defense Reform Act.",
  "Yes. So I think the only way -- somehow, you've accepted the Solicitor General's argument, which I don't think you can, but if you did accept it on merits, it runs headlong into our third argument, which the Solicitor General takes exactly the opposite position, which is, the Speedy Trial Act is its own self-contained universe that doesn't incorporate any other statutes or any other provisions of law.",
  "I think you could do that, Justice Ginsburg. I think you could decide based on my discussion of the Zabawa case. There's another case that postdates the rule 45 amendments, called Clifton, out of the Southern District of Mississippi. So you might decide that there's enough of an ongoing question here to write an opinion. You could do either one.",
  "Right. And I think, Justice Ginsburg, as to your -- your question, I'll just leave it to this Court's best discretion how it wants to handle that issue. Now, Justice Kennedy, let me turn to the merits. We think this is a straightforward case where the text dictates the outcome of the case. Remember, the key words in the statute are \"delay resulting from,\" and I think the -- I think the ordinary meaning, in fact, the only meaning, of \"delay\" is a hindrance to progress or a postponement. So it's -­",
  "That's exactly our argument, Mr. Chief Justice. Our argument is there's two ways you can have delay: One is by the trial date simply being moved to accommodate the motion. The other -- and this is where we agree with what the Solicitor General said here today, as well as at page 38-39 of his opening brief -- delay can also, in the ordinary English language, mean that the trial date was originally set to accommodate the motions in the way you just described. But what the Solicitor General is arguing for is something much more dramatic than that. They are arguing for an exclusion of the time, even if trial date was set irregardless of the motions -­",
  "Well, ordinarily, Justice Ginsburg -- remember, this is only a small subset of cases. But in those cases, ordinarily, I would think the trial judge would say on the record when the date is set. Now, if it's -- if there's motion practice before there's any date that's ever set, the NACDL brief, I think, explains how that works in the district in the Sixth Circuit right now. Parties often stipulate or are asked to stipulate by the court. Common sense goes a long way in this scenario, Justice Ginsburg. It's obvious.",
  "Pardon me?",
  "Defendants don't always benefit from the clock running, Justice Ginsburg. I think there's two reasons why they might stipulate. One is because it might simply be obvious that the motion is of sufficient weight and difficulty that it's going to consume the court's resources, so why argue something that wouldn't have a basis to begin with? But I think the NACDL brief is forthright in saying, at least at the beginning of criminal cases, often defendants find themselves wanting more time, and so, again, they don't have the incentive to argue against that.",
  "I think the -- the text of the statute allows you to say either 30 or 10. I think in light of this Court's Henderson decision -- and perhaps I think Congress had administrability concerns in mind with that last clause -- I think 30 days could be excluded. But if you disagree with me on that and you want to have a rigid textual reading of the statute resulting from only meaning 10 days, I think that's your only other option. Because, if I could ask the Court, or at least direct the Court to page 6 of the Solicitor General's reply brief, this is where they give -­ because I think what the government wants to do is pose these difficult hypotheticals, and the sort of difficult question you just raised, Justice Alito, and have this Court respond by saying, oh, we're just going to throw the words \"delay resulting from\" out of the statute. Because there's only two definitions, two ways to deal with what the Solicitor General offers. First, they say that delay means time, and I think ordinary -- in ordinary English language, \"delay\" means something more than time. It means postponement. So then the fallback argument -- this is the second paragraph on page 6 -- is that the occurrence that is postponed is the STA's deadline for commencing trial, and our suggestion is that that begs the whole question. That can't possibly be right, because the whole reason that you're looking to subsection (d) to apply it is to ask whether you should exclude the time.",
  "I think for two reasons, I would disagree, respectfully, Justice Sotomayor. First is, I take that language to say that we're going to now tell you all the circumstances under which you exclude time, and so if any of these subsections are satisfied, you exclude the time. But the -­",
  "-- Solicitor General's argument is that you start from the premise. \"Delay resulting from\" means you've already excluded the time. That's the premise.",
  "Well, if -- if there was delay. Maybe another example, Justice Sotomayor. In subsection 7, which is at (4)(a) of the government's appendix, I think is another way of showing that it can't possibly -- even if it weren't begging the question, it can't possibly be right. It has to be talking about the trial itself, because this is the continuance -- the end of the justice continuance section. And it says, \"Any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by a judge on his own motion,\" and blah, blah, blah, \"if certain criteria are met.\" Now, it's very clear that in that section, \"period\" -- \"period of delay resulting from\" can't mean that we've already said that the clock is stopped, because there's an \"if\" clause that gives you certain things that have to be satisfied in order to exclude it. So I think starting with the very title of the Act we're talking about, the Speedy Trial Act, and the -- the idea of the words \"delay resulting from\" can only sensibly mean delay resulting from trial. And so I think the definition that we've given you again, which is, delay results from a trial if the trial itself is postponed, or if the trial is set in a way that accommodates the motion, is the only way to give meaning to the operative words in the statute.",
  "The distinction between administrative and nonadministrative motions, I think, doesn't matter in this case because trial wasn't -­",
  "Well, it would matter, I think, Justice Sotomayor, in a circumstance where the trial date hadn't been set yet and then was set, and an argument might arise -- well, I think we've had this dialogue already to some degree. I didn't -- I expected these kinds of motions to be filed. I knew there was going to be a suppression hearing. We had the whole -­ therefore, I set the trial out. That would seem to be saying this was a nonadministrative matter that I had to accommodate. I don't think a trial judge -- put another way, I don't think a trial judge could say I'm setting trial date outside the 70-day deadline because I had to sign my name to that pro haec vice motion.",
  "That may well be correct, but I don't know why it would matter, because it doesn't matter until you get outside of the 70 days to begin with. So -­",
  "Let me say a couple things, Justice Breyer. First, with all due respect, I have to disagree with your premise that it's possible to read the statute the way the Solicitor General wants to read it. Now I'll accept for purposes of responding to your question, let's imagine that it were possible to read it that way. I think our rule is not as difficult to administer as you think it might be in the -- NACDL brief LDY. And indeed the Solicitor General -- this has been the -- this has been the law in -- in the Sixth Circuit for 17 months. They haven't pointed to a single dismissal as a result of it. Now let me take the other side, and this brings us to the dialogue during Mr. Roberts' argument; the Solicitor General's rule isn't so easy, either, unless you simply cease caring at all about the Act. You could have a perfectly administrable rule that says every singly motion, no matter what the circumstances, tolls the clock. But that's not the law in the First Circuit, for example. They're made clear as Justice Sotomayor said that if a motion is filed to frustrate the speedy trial clock, then we're not going to exclude it; and that makes perfect sense. I mean, look at this case. And I'm not going to suggest there was any ill will or bad faith in this case; but the facts of the case illustrate the problem. On August 1st, trial date was set for August 14th. There were 14 days before the trial was going to happen. Yet there were only -- even under the best reading there were only 10 days left on the clock. So if no motions had been filed, unquestionably we would have a Speedy Trial Act violation. So the government's whole case hinges on the fact that because it filed this purely administrative motion to bring a gun into the courtroom, a motion I might add that at the pretrial conference the judge had already told the government was going to be granted, and so I don't know why it couldn't have been made at the moment the evidence was introduced; and one other administration motion, then the Speedy Trial Act isn't violated. And to borrow the Solicitor General's own phrase from page 38 of his brief, that outcome bears no relation to the Act's purpose. So what you have to do to have, I think, the government's argument be at all faithful, even if it were possible under the language -­ have it be at all faithful with the purpose of the Act, is to have some kind of exception for motions that frustrate, motions that are pretextual, motions that are purely administrative, however it would be defined.",
  "And you walk in -­",
  "I -- well, two things, Justice Ginsburg. First of all, we're not relying in this Court on the Speedy Trial Act motion to get us to the Speedy Trial Act violation. The two motions the government filed get you to the 70 days, and so we haven't made an argument with respect to the Speedy Trial Act. But if we had to, the argument would be -- with regard to that motion, would be that it didn't delay trial. Trial had already been set, the Court said this is when we're going to trial; trial wasn't moved, and we all went to trial. And so -­",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "I think that might be an argument for writing the Speedy Trial Act a different way, Justice Sotomayor; but if the question is whether the motion delayed trial -- and that's the question that the Speedy Trial Act requires the judge to ask and answer -- then the administrative piece of paper going across the judge's desk when the judge knows ahead of time it isn't going to cause any difficult, simply doesn't delay trial. At page, I believe it's 5 or 6 of the NACDL brief, they talk about pretrial conferences. And they say what happens in the Sixth Circuit right now is the judge holds the conference; as you say, counsel wakes up; and everybody -- and the judge says tell me the motions you're going to file. And the counsel from both sides tell the judge what motions are going to be filed, and they discuss right then and there whether they're going to delay -- whether they're going to cause some delay for trial. And so -­",
  "I think that's right, and I think that's -­",
  "I think the difficulty is with the word \"from,\" Justice Scalia. I think it's a tough word to know exactly what transition is taking place there, but in this Court's Bloate decision, last term, I think -- what I'm -- the argument I'm making is perfectly consistent with that decision, where it said the \"from clause\" is sort of the boundaries on when subsection D applies. If you're talking about delay that a motion caused either after the hearing or before the filing, we don't want to hear from you. But the from clause tells you if the delay falls within those two goalposts, then it's excludable.",
  "I don't think it's a perfect way to say it, either, Justice Scalia. And I said -- in my dialogue with Justice Alito, I think that you could also say, especially with a little bit of pushing on Henderson, that \"resulting from\" actually gives you a specific time period in between those that you have to exclude. But I think that that's the best reading of the Act, and again, it's the only one that gives -- that gives meaning to the phrase delay resulting from. If I might just say one or two words to circle back to where I began, Mr. Tinklenberg urges you to affirm the Sixth Circuit decision or to dismiss this case as improvidently granted; but what he urges you not to do and thinks there's no basis in precedent for doing, which is to reverse the lower court without reading the alternative arguments; and with all due respect, the 10-day argument that we preserved in our bio and we fully made in our bottom side brief in this case, I think is extraordinarily strong, and it's difficult to get around in this case for all the reasons I've explained. So with that, I'll -- I'll answer any other questions this Court has about that argument, because I think it's very important. Otherwise, I'm happy to submit the case.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The text, purpose, and history of the Confrontation Clause make it clear that the prosecution cannot introduce one person's testimonial statements through the in-court testimony of someone else. Thus, having held in Melendez-Diaz that a lab analyst's statements in a forensic lab report are testimonial, this is an easy case. The State violated the Confrontation Clause by introducing lab analyst Curtis Caylor's statements in a forensic lab report without putting him on the stand. The New Mexico Supreme Court resisted this analysis, straightforward as it is, on the ground that Mr. Bullcoming, as the defendant, had the opportunity to cross-examine a substitute or a surrogate witness, Mr. Razatos. But a surrogate witness procedure violates all four components of the right to confrontation. It quite obviously violates the defendant's right to have the witness testify in his presence, in the presence of the jury so the jury can observe it, and under oath, as happened in this case.",
  "Well, the default rule under the Confrontation Clause is in presence, in the courtroom. Now, in Maryland v. Craig, this Court held in a child witness setting -- of course, very different than this case -- that closed-circuit TV would be permissible, and I believe, you know, in a future case, if the State perhaps made some sort of showing that the lab analyst couldn't come to court for some reason, and certainly if the defendant stipulated, and maybe even if the defendant didn't stipulate, a court could accommodate -­",
  "I don't think it would be adequate, Justice Ginsburg, with at least some -- absent at least some showing of unavailability of the witness or -- making the witness unable to come to court.

But the one thing I want to add is that the Public Defender Service brief makes clear, and the facts of this case make clear, it's going to be very rare that a defendant wants to do that. The defendant in this case wanted to stipulate to the nurse's blood draw and that it was his blood that was drawn in the hospital. It was the State that insisted on putting her on the stand. It happens in courtrooms all across the country.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, I will gladly accept (b) if we want to say that consequences are irrelevant, because I think that's what -- the Sixth Amendment is what it is, but I think the only thing I would add is that all I can say is, empirically, in the States that have followed the rule we advocate today, long before Crawford or Melendez-Diaz, it simply is a manageable burden.

  "So what he did is just read the report.",
  "Right.",
  "Probably not. Provided, as you say, the chain of custody had been either properly proved or stipulated to, I think an expert could take the stand and say, I'm looking at a graph, and here's what the graph shows me. Now, you might get into -­",
  "No, Justice Ginsburg. I'm certainly not here today to agree with the New Mexico Supreme Court. What they said doesn't -- doesn't make any sense in this case because (a) the printout was never introduced into evidence or looked at, and (b) it would matter a great deal -- and this is how I continue my answer. It mattered a great deal what was on the printout. If the printout is nothing more than a graph, then I don't think you can say that's a testimonial statement. If a printout comes out of a machine that also says at the top blood sample was Donald Bullcoming's, here's the test that was run, et cetera, those may well be testimonial statements that the analyst triggered the machine to spit out. So the Fourth Circuit has wrestled with this issue in the Washington case, and you can -- you can look at the majority and the dissenting opinions in that case. I think that the question would arise in that scenario, if the graphs were -- if the machine printouts were introduced into evidence, the question would be, are the machine printouts testimonial? And to the extent they are, you'd have the same problem in this case. To the extent they are not -- as the Fourth Circuit suggested, at least to some degree they may not be -- then you don't have a -­",

  "-- or contaminated.",
  "I think that would be a question of State law, Justice Alito.",
  "It wouldn't be a Confrontation Clause question.",
  "Justice Alito, I think if you look earlier in the Joint Appendix, I believe it's at page 40, where the State for the first time says we're going to put Mr. Razatos on the stand instead of Mr. Caylor, there's a -- there's an objection there as well that says you can't then put the document into evidence that Mr. Caylor wrote if he's not going to be on the stand. That's the critical objection here. Now, you're right, there's nothing wrong with Mr. Razatos having taken the stand in this case, there's nothing wrong with him having described typical procedures in the lab. I think the objection you're pointing was to the one that said -- again, as far as the State law objection, saying he can't testify to something he doesn't have personal knowledge about, which is whether the procedures were followed in this case. But Mr. -- Mr. Razatos could certainly take the stand and testify to -- to general procedures. But at page 54 and 55 of the Joint Appendix, he -- he simply reads the report's results. And so you have two Confrontation Clause violations, really. You have the report being introduced in the first instance, and then you have -- I believe it's at 54 and 55 of the Joint Appendix. You have the prosecutor asking Mr. Razatos, what was the result? He says the result was .21. As the State itself says at page 58, note 15 of its brief, there was no independent analysis being applied there. All Mr. Razatos was doing was repeating and giving the jury the conclusions that Mr. Caylor had reached.",
  "If it said nothing more than the .21 coming out of the machine, I think probably not. Now, judge Michael in the First Circuit would disagree; and so that's an issue that's not in this case, and I think you could debate whether that should -- even that should be considered hearsay of the operator.",
  "Well -- well, the question that would arise there would be whether the .21 should be treated as Mr. Caylor's statement. Let me -- if I give you two hypotheticals, maybe it explains. On the one hand, I don't think anyone would claim that a time stamp on a fax machine, for example, is a human statement. It's a machine statement, and so therefore it can't be testimonial. On the other hand, if someone types out an affidavit on a word processor and hits print, you can't say, well, that's the machine talking, not the human. So the question arises in the lab context whether a .21 or anything else that comes out of the machine has enough human influence that it ought to be treated as the -- as the person's statement. Now, you don't have to resolve that in this case, and what's important to emphasize is that that hypothetical of the .21, even though the State would like it to be this case, is really miles away for the reason you said, because the State proved a lot more than .21 by Mr. Caylor's lab report, and that's why these hypotheticals I think are important.",
  "The State could -­",
  "The State could make that choice, but it would be a considerably weaker case, Justice Alito, not just because they wouldn't have anyone saying that the procedures were actually followed in this case, but also in this case it would be a far weaker case because they'd have somebody on the stand who would now be subject to cross-examination as to why he had been recently put on unpaid leave.",
  "That was -­",
  "That was his defense, Justice Alito, and here's why the lab report is still important, though. Because you're right, he did admit he was drunk. But remember, he was not convicted simply of DUI; he was convicted in New Mexico law of aggravated DUI. And to have aggravated DUI you need to have up to a .16 blood alcohol count. So the report is the only the State could have proved over .16, even if Mr. Bullcoming admitted that he had been drinking that day. So that's why it's important in this case. That's why he wanted to challenge -- that's one reason why he wanted to challenge the report. Let me come back to the -- to the important point, I think, though, that what the State wants to be able to do -- I don't want to ascribe a bad motive, but what the State's rule would allow States to do is to insulate people from cross-examination, not just Mr. Caylor in this case, but -- but -- but please pay attention to, for example, the Dungo case that's cited in our opening brief, from California. That's a case where a coroner had been fired from his job, blacklisted by law enforcement, and prohibited from testifying in many counties because he falsified his reports, his autopsy reports, by writing them with the police report sitting right next to him.",
  "And -­",
  "Well, we -- we could have, but Melendez-Diaz makes clear that doesn't satisfy the Confrontation Clause. And when you deal especially with a garden variety DUI case there is only so much time and resources at issue, and that's why the Confrontation Clause I think is especially important in a case like this, that the prosecution bring its witnesses into court. And if I could just finish the Dungo story, in the -- in the California Court of Appeal, when they reviewed that case, they said the prosecutor's intent in that case had been to shield Mr. -- I'm sorry, the -­ the actual analyst in that case from cross-examination. And, in fact, the supervisor when he took the stand at the preliminary hearing told -- told the court the reason why they have me here is the prosecutors find it too hard to have this person in court. So that would be perfectly permissible, if -- if the State win this case today and surrogate testimony were allowed.",
  "Let me give you two answers, Justice Ginsburg, but first let me say we don't know whether somebody doesn't remember it until he's put on the stand. What the NACDL brief says is that even though analysts don't ordinary remember run-of-the-mill tests like this, that do remember if something went wrong or if something went haywire. So we don't know that. But assuming you're right that -­",
  "That's my understanding, Justice Scalia. So that's another reason why he may have remembered. But even if he didn't, there's two things that could be importantly probed here. One is his credibility. And I've explained why that was a very serious issue in this case, because he was put on unpaid leave. The other is his competence. Again, Melendez-Diaz says it's important to have the person on the stand to explain how he does his job, for the jury to observe his professionalism, for him to explain here's my understanding of these procedures, et cetera. That could be very important, and if I could leave you with one thing before I -­",
  "Of course, it can, Justice Scalia. And on the flip side, even if he doesn't remember, cross-examination is very important. If I could leave you with one thing that I think isn't highlighted in the brief maybe the way it should have been. There's a line of cases from this Court, California v. Green, Delaware v. Fensterer, and United States v. Owens, that all hold that if a witness takes the stand and doesn't remember anything, that the Confrontation Clause is still -- is still satisfied, as long as that witness is on the stand for the reason Justice Scalia explained and because the jury can observe them, et cetera. And so, the flip side of that has to be -­ it's the holding of Owens most recently is that those are meaningful things that the Confrontation Clause requires. And so the flip side of those cases has to be that if the witness takes the stand and doesn't remember, the ineffectiveness potentially of a cross-examination there doesn't matter, either. If I could reserve what little time I have left.",
  "Thank you. Let me try to make four quick points. First, Justice Alito, I said the first objection was at JA 40, it's actually 44-45 in the Joint Appendix. With regard to the State's argument about whether this document is testimonial, I would simply urge the Court to take a very close look at the lab report itself. It's at JA 62. At the top it says, Mr. Chief Justice, in response to your question, arresting officer identification, and the officer writes, check for blood alcohol concentration. That's the order to the lab. If you look at the bottom in the certification of analyst, he certifies that the following is true and correct, signs his name, and perhaps the most critical thing is at the very bottom, the actual rules of the New Mexico evidence law and criminal procedure law are referenced. So, it's exactly like Melendez-Diaz. This is a document that is expressly prepared for substitute live testimony.",
  "Not under oath if a certification is actually different than an oath, that just makes this worse, as in Crawford this Court said that it would be implausible that trial by affidavit would be prohibited but trial by unsworn affidavit would be okay.",
  "They say much the same thing. There are -- there are several rules referenced at the bottom that all make this automatically admissible, notwithstanding the hearsay rule to prove the truth of the matter asserted. With respect to Justice Ginsburg's question about retesting, you are exactly right. The State had many choices in the case -- in this case about how to proceed. But if it wanted Mr. Razatos to be its witness, all it had to do was have him do a -- retest it and write a new report and have him be the witness. There is no reason it would have to introduce Mr. Caylor's report then and come up against any State law issue. Mr. Razatos could have been the live witness.",
  "And I think that -- I'm sorry. I think that goes to my last point, which is, Justice Breyer, you're talking about States that do this -- I'll combine my answer to these two things. A continuance would have been perfectly -- perfectly appropriate if that scenario had arisen, Mr. Chief Justice, and that's what -- one thing the public -- Public Defender Service brief it talks about 23 -- 26 jurisdictions encompassing 23 different States that follow the rule that we're advocating today. And it -- we're not asking for more witnesses. It's important that we're -- this isn't a multiple witness problem, we're just asking for a different witness.",
  "In other words, the State just brought the wrong witness. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Any decision announced from this Court before a State prisoner's conviction becomes final constitutes clearly established law for purposes of applying section 2254(d) of AEDPA. For decades, in fact, it has been a bedrock rule under Teague and Griffith that State prisoners are entitled to the benefit of decisions from this Court that come down before finality, and that rule has delivered fairness and clarity to an area that that this Court has acknowledged previously lacked it. There's no compelling reason to chart a new course now. There's no doubt that AEDPA changed Federal habeas law in many important ways, but it did not change habeas law with respect to retroactivity, for under this Court's Teague jurisprudence, States already had comity, as opposed to other areas. Now - -",
  "If this Court had GVR'ed the case, it -- yes.",
  "Well, I -- well, I'm not sure --",
  "Of course.",
  "Well, let me take those one at a time, Your Honor. First, with -- with the GVR request, if he'd had counsel that would have advised him to seek cert, he may well have done it, and this Court may well have GVR'ed, but realize that this Court isn't bound to do that. This Court has discretionary jurisdiction, and I don't think this Court wants to take on the responsibility of deciding every single case that falls into a twilight zone situation. You're going to have cases, like this one very well would have in light of what the Pennsylvania -- the State filed in its own supreme court, wrapped up in procedural arguments, harmless error allegations, perhaps alternative State grounds. And this Court often has decided that habeas is the better place to work that out, not GVR. Now, it may well have GVR'ed, but I don't think the Court wants to take on that responsibility.",
  "Well, I can think of -- let me take it one step at a time. I think there are cases that this Court doesn't GVR. Because they are so procedurally complicated, the Court leaves it. And, in fact, I can think of one case right now in California. After Melendez-Diaz, there was a case called Geyer that came out of the California courts, that this Court did -- held for Melendez-Diaz but did not GVR, in part because I think the State was making harmless error allegations there. And now the States and California are trying to figure out what to do in light of that.",
  "So, that's just one example, but --",
  "Well, let me get back to Justice Breyer's question, though, with the assumption that if he has a lawyer he's going to bring it up here. Of course, Mr. Greene's right to appointed counsel under Pennsylvania State law ended when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed his case.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Correct, I think that's right.",
  "Okay. So let me address that. So there -- I don't think it is a given, Your Honor, that we would have been able -- Mr. Greene would have been able to bring this claim in the Pennsylvania State courts. The -- the justices on -- the judges on the Third Circuit disagreed about that, and it's unsettled under Pennsylvania law. But what is clear is that --",
  "Pardon me?",
  "They do say that now, Justice Ginsburg, and all I can say is we checked as hard as we could to find an actual case in Pennsylvania in the procedural posture of somebody going back in the situation, and we haven't found one --",
  "-- that either decides it or the State takes a position one way or the other. But there are many States -- you don't have to dwell on -- just on Pennsylvania, because there are States -- we cite them in our brief -- that would not let somebody amicus brief from the group of States I think is telling in its silence, that none of the 12 States that signed on to that brief are willing to say you could bring a claim like this in collateral review in our own State courts.",
  "Right.",
  "I think that's a fair statement, Your Honor. And the way you frame it, though, frames what sounds to me more like an exhaustion argument than it does about a statutory construction argument with respect to 2254(d). And this Court has never held either that you have to seek cert in this Court in order to exhaust State remedies, nor to take a -- to take a claim back to State collateral review that you've already taken up through the State direct review system. So if we had an exhaustion case in the future, maybe somebody would make that argument. But that's not what's before you today. What's before you today is the hypothetical that -- that Mr. Greene actually did seek cert and for some reason this didn't GVR, or he did seek review in the Pennsylvania courts and they refused to hear it. And under the State's position, even then you would bar him from getting the reliance on Gray, because Gray came down after the Pennsylvania Supreme - - I'm sorry -- the Pennsylvania Superior Court decision.",
  "Well, he very much had raised the Gray issue below, Justice Ginsburg. You're absolutely right that the State, faced with really no alternative but to try to argue waiver, did argue waiver in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which did dismiss the case. But, of course, the order doesn't say why it dismissed the case. And we litigated that very issue in the lower courts, and the Third Circuit squarely held that Mr. Greene had, in fact, preserved this claim in the Pennsylvania courts, and on top of that, the Pennsylvania Superior Court had reached it and resolved -- understood him to be raising a Gray-type argument and resolved it by citing a Pennsylvania case that had previously held that just putting an X in place of -- in place of the defendant's name was good enough to satisfy Bruton.",
  "Right. We don't disagree that it's a backward-looking statute. There is a retroactivity cutoff. The question is, where is it? And we don't contend, Justice Alito, that it's an unreasonable application. We contend that there's more statutory language that it's contrary to --",
  "There's two prongs --",
  "Yes. Justice Alito cited one prong of 2254(d) --",
  "-- which is unreasonable application.",
  "I think the more natural --",
  "It was contrary to this Court's clearly established law as of the date of finality. So, you have a statute that says it has to be -- it resulted in a decision that was contrary --",
  "No, it's the decision from the Pennsylvania Superior Court, Justice Scalia, that's contrary to clearly established law as of the date of finality. So, you have to --",
  "That's not the date they made it, no. But the question of contrary to, as this Court said in Williams and has repeated many times, is whether the lower court either did one of two things: decided a case -- decided the case with a question of law and decided the question of law opposite as how this Court has decided it, or decided the case differently than this Court has in another case on materially indistinguishable facts.",
  "Justice Kagan, no, we don't think it does, because there has always been a difference between facts and law. So, this Court of course held in Pinholster that you look at the factual record that existed before the State court, but ordinary appellate review and principles have always allowed new law to be considered up to a certain point. And so, it's consistent with Pinholster to say you take the set of facts, just as you would from a trial court, but that new law up to the point of finality is -- can be considered.",
  "We don't -- again, we don't disagree at all that it's in the past tense. The question is where in the past is the cutoff? And so, what we say is -- and it's important what this Court did say in Pinholster. In Pinholster, it didn't say that the plain language of 2254(d) resolved this. It said that -- I think I'm going to get this quote right -- that the structure of the statute compelled the conclusion that for facts you leave the window. Well, the structure of this statute as to law compels the opposite conclusion.",
  "For a few reasons --",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, if I can get this point across. I'm not saying \"is,\" because then there would be no -- there would be no retroactivity cutoff whatsoever. I agree that the statute says \"was,\" but it's was as of when? We say \"was\" as of the time of finality. The State wants to read into the statute \"was\" as of the time the decision was made. And so, that's the question you have. And if you look to the structure of the statute, you'll see lots of clues that Congress didn't intend to change the previous clear retroactivity cutoff at Teague. And, of course, that's the barrier the State has to overcome here, a clear and specific change in law. If you look at the limitations provision, it references finality. If you look at various provisions of the statute that reference retroactivity law, they reference new rules in retroactivity. And this Court has held in Tyler v. Cain that Teague is what Congress had in mind when it did that. So --",
  "Justice Sotomayor, we think Horn is another structural component of the statute that shows why we win. And let me explain why. Again, we don't disagree it's a backward-looking statute, but backward-looking to finality. Now, what Horn held -- Horn rejected a form of the very same argument that the State is making today, which is 2254(d) changes retroactivity law to establish the cutoff at the time of the State court decision, not as of finality. This Court rejected that argument and said, no, Teague and 2254(d) are distinct. And we think the best way to understand them as distinct is to understand that 2254(d) deals with the standard of review, and Teague still continues to control finality. Now, in light of Horn -- I'm sorry -- retroactivity. Now, in light of Horn on the books, if the State were right that what 2254(d) is actually trying to do is also do retroactivity work and prevent the State courts from, as it put in its brief, being \"blind-sided,\" then Teague would serve -- no longer serve any purpose, and Horn would have had to come out the other way, because once you say 2254(d) is actually concerned with setting a cutoff at the time of the last State court decision for retroactivity purposes, you don't need Teague anymore. So, Horn would have had to come out the other way if the State is right. Now, let me go back to one other structural feature of the statute that -- that shows that Congress had in mind that Teague would continue, and that's the one I referenced earlier with respect to retroactivity. Keep in mind the State's argument would bar not just somebody like Greene from relying on a new case like Gray, but it would also -- the implication would be it would bar him from relying on a new case like Roper v. Simmons, Graham v. Florida, or other cases that alter -- that say the Constitution can no longer cover or punish substantive conduct in a certain way. Because, again, if Teague is out of the picture --",
  "Well -- but, no, the State's rule - -",
  "It's not different -- under the State's view of AEDPA, Justice Kennedy. Remember, the State's view of AEDPA is that if a decision comes down after the latest State court's decision on the merits, then the defendant cannot seek relief based on it. And on page 38 of the red brief, in footnote 12, they try to deal with this problem, but not in a satisfactory way. And it's not an abstract problem. If I give this Court a few citations -- if you'll permit me to give you three citations of cases working through the lower courts right now that raise Roper, Graham, and Atkins claims that the lower courts -- the only way they have reached them is by saying that Teague still has a role to play with respect to 2254(d). And the three citations, if I can give them very quickly, are Arroyo, 362 F. Supp. 2d 869; Holladay, 331 F.3d 1169; and Simms 2011 Westlaw 1161696. Again, that's another structural feature of the statute that the State simply can't get around with its -- with its view. Now, some of the lower courts haven't quite focused on this, and, in fact, it's because for many, many years after AEDPA was passed, States didn't even make the argument that you have before you today. All the way through Smith v. Spisak, which came to this court just a couple of years ago, the State of Ohio, for example, was not even making this argument, which is quite odd if you step back for a moment and realize that the State's position today is that the plain text of AEDPA is so clear there's no possible way you could read it in any other direction. So --",
  "So, Justice Ginsburg, let me answer that question by starting, if I may, before AEDPA, because before AEDPA, under Caspari and Teague, there's no doubt whatsoever that that's what a Federal habeas corpus court would have done, is say the cutoff is finality. Because, remember, finality doesn't exist in a vacuum. It exists against the Griffith rule. And so, what Federal courts had always asked is, did the defendant not get credit for a case that he's entitled to under Griffith? And so, the question is: Did AEDPA change that rule? And, Justice Ginsburg, you asked about the purpose or spirit of AEDPA. We think what the spirit of AEDPA is, is to give States deference and to give them comity where they otherwise didn't have it at the time. And so, it changed the standard of review, it changed the statute of limitations, but it didn't need to change Teague. It didn't need to change retroactivity because, as this Court had explained in Teague itself, in Justice Kennedy's long opinion in Wright v. West concurring, the very purpose of Teague was to give States the comity that -- of not foisting new law upon them. And so, you do end up, of course, in this situation, which is -- I think we called it earlier the twilight zone or perfect storm situation. But this is something that this Court saw coming under Teague and long ago, even though even under those cases this Court said the purpose of retroactivity law is not to hold the States responsible for something new. And so, the question is why did we have this twilight zone under Teague and why should it continue today? And the answer again is because Teague doesn't exist in a vacuum; it works in tandem with Griffith. Remember, what Griffith said is that it violates basic norms of constitutional adjudication for a defendant to not get the credit for a decision that this Court announces before his State conviction becomes final. And so, Teague is necessary as the other side of the coin to make Griffith work. And to undo all of that and to go back to an unsettled state of retroactivity law, whether it's -- whether it's Linkletter or something else, is going to really cause problems. Let me give you one other image that the States' situation --",
  "Here's why, Justice Ginsburg: Take the typical case, and maybe you'll put in your mind, for example, the Martinez oral argument you had last week. A typical case works its way through the State courts. There's going to be an appeal as of right in the State intermediate court, where all of the claims the defendant brings can be addressed. Then what might happen quite often is the State Supreme Court is going to hear, like this Court does, maybe one or two of those claims and address them on the merits. Then he's going to go into State collateral review and bring an IAC claim, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and maybe whatever other claim he couldn't have brought earlier. Under the State's rule, you have three different retroactivity cutoffs for different claims that are brought and adjudicated at the different part of that regime. You have a retroactivity cutoff at the intermediate court for certain claims, a retroactivity cutoff at the Pennsylvania -- I'm sorry -- the State Supreme Court for the -- for certain other claims, and a retroactivity cutoff at finality for certain other claims. And we think that's just unwieldy, and not only that, it's just difficult. In Cullen v. Pinholster --",
  "It does tell you to go on a claim-by-claim basis; that's right. And therein lies the difficulty. With our system, you simply look at the date of finality for purposes of any claim being adjudicated on Federal habeas. Under the State system, you have to go claim by claim with different dates and have arguments, as this Court did in Pinholster, for example, about whether this claim is the same claim that was brought, or the State supreme court decided this claim but not the other claim, and whether the States --",
  "No, I --",
  "I'm not objecting to the claim-by-claim nature of the approach. I'm just saying it would be unwieldy and administratively difficult, and, therefore, I think you can question whether Congress would have contemplated not just going claim by claim for purposes of adjudication, but for purposes of retroactivity analysis. And it just is going to create problems that I don't think anyone would argue, and I don't think the State has even contended, that Congress had any of this in mind when it passed this.",
  "I think, Justice Breyer --",
  "You're right that there's -- that there's arbitrariness built into any cutoff.",
  "And the State makes this point in its brief. But by disjoining habeas law from Griffith, you're going to create a whole new level of arbitrariness that we think is undesirable and unnecessary. So, for example, in a situation like this everything is going to turn on whether a State supreme court grants review and ultimately disposes an issue on the merits. And many State supreme courts might take the view that, well, hey, if the State supreme court -- if the U.S. Supreme Court has just decided this issue and we don't have any new law to make here, this isn't worth our time. So, we're just going to let it go.",
  "I think many State supreme courts -- I think there's a possible two questions you asked. One is whether State supreme courts in that situation would themselves GVR back to the immediate court. Pennsylvania, by our estimation, doesn't seem to do that. And many State supreme courts don't do it. They don't have to do it. And, again, you have the problem, if you're going to rely on somebody to bring the case up to this Court and say that's the only way that he can get benefit of the new decision, I think this Court -- I know it's counterintuitive, but you're going to have to take a hard look, not just at fairness and equity, but at this Court's right to counsel jurisprudence and ask yourself whether somebody under the Halbert test who has a right to have a decision on the merits of that claim and that's the only time it can be litigated, therefore has to have the right to counsel because he couldn't otherwise navigate the process.",
  "If I could reserve --",
  "Well, there's at least a backup that -- a backup that doesn't exist today -- or I'm sorry, that wouldn't exist under the State's rule. And so, the difference it would make would be he would have a second chance to bring the claim where if he brought it the district courts often would appoint counsel. If I could reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you. Let me make three points, starting with the most important, which is the Teague exceptions we've been talking about. Now, the State, in its brief in footnote 12 and today, says actual innocence, cause and prejudice, or something, would let you get around the problem that I've raised. But that doesn't work, because all those doctrines do is allow you to bring the case forward. They just allow you to get out from under a situation where you haven't preserved a claim previously. But this case is all about a situation where the defendant does everything he is supposed to do, everything he can do, but it just so happens that this Court's decision has come down after the last State court decision on the merits, and the State on collateral review has refused -- if it's been given a chance -- to remedy that. The three cases I cited to you -- at least one of them involves a situation where the defendant did go back to the State -- and I believe it's the Graham case -- and said apply this to me. The State of Virginia said, no, you're barred from State collateral review. So, all those doctrines do is allow the defendant to get in the door. Once he's in the door, he still has to satisfy 2254(d)(1), which says that no claim shall be granted -- no -- habeas relief shall not be granted on any claim unless the language we've been talking about today. So, the only way out of the problem that we,ve phrased is to say that Teague decides what is clearly established law, not the language of the statute itself, under the State's reading of the statute. The second thing is, as to this Court's GVR practice, I don't think there is much doubt, in all fairness --",
  "Well, not if the State says that you're barred in its own -- remember, that will get you out from the problem of being able to get in the door, because what would happen in that situation is the State would say this is waived because he didn't make it earlier. And then you'd go to the Teague -- you'd go to the exceptions in AEDPA for new claims and whether actual innocence applies, et cetera. All those are merely gateways to the question of whether the defendant gets relief, which is controlled by 2254(d).",
  "I think it -- I think it would satisfy one of the Teague exceptions. That's what the lower courts have all held. If it wouldn't, certainly the hypothetical that Justice Breyer gave about the First Amendment would satisfy the Teague exception, and you have the exactly the same problem.",
  "No, we think it applies anytime afterwards, too. But that just makes the problem bigger than just the twilight zone.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "Right.",
  "No, but that wouldn't be a decision on the merits, Justice Breyer. The decision on the merits would have been earlier in the proceedings, when you argued I can't be executed because I was 17 when I committed the crime, and a State would have rejected that before Roper, and then you end up, after Roper, a State saying we won't hear this on collateral review because we've already heard it once. And then we have the situation we have today, and the only way out of that situation is to understand that Teague continues to control what is clearly established law. And it's not just a problem. Again, it goes back to the structure of the whole statute, because the question this Court is supposed to be asking itself is, is there clear and specific language in the new statute to think that Congress wanted to dispense with Teague? And this is very clear indication that, no, that's not what Congress had in mind. That's not what Congress had in mind. And so, this is a case not just about habeas law but also this Court's relationship with Congress, about whether Congress clearly had the kind of intent that's necessary.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Unlike the previous case, this case does not involve the need to formulate Federal common law or to survey customary international law. Here Congress has expressly created the cause of action at issue in a statute. And we know that in every single other Federal tort statute that Congress has ever enacted, it has provided for organizational liability. As, Justice Kennedy, I think you put it earlier, it's a simple concept in our country.",
  "Of course, the question --",
  "That was my next sentence, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you. But, of course, the question arises in this case why did Congress use the word \"individual\"? And we think the answer comes from the Tel-Oren case, which is the case, of course, from the D.C. Circuit that gave rise to the TVPA. And in that case, Judge Edwards wrote a lengthy concurrence where he again and again used the word \"individual liability\" and \"individual\" to describe the PLO, which was the very defendant in that case, against the backdrop of international law, which uses the term \"individual\" to differentiate anyone from the state. After Nuremberg, starting with the discussions were recited most prominently in our reply brief at pages 6 to 8, Professor Jessup and many others discussed whether international law applies simply against states or whether it applies to, quote, \"individuals.\" And the word \"individual\" was used again and again to mean anyone but the state. And as Professor Jessup and many others said, it includes organizations and juridical persons. And this is the usage that Judge Edwards used in his opinion in Tel-Oren. He uses the word \"individual\" 43 times in that opinion. And if you look at nothing else --",
  "No. What Judge Edwards concluded, Justice Ginsburg, was that, as he understood the Alien Tort Statute at the time against the backdrop of international law, that any private actor acting under color of law could be held liable. And what Judge Edwards decided in that particular case is that the PLO as it then existed was not a state actor. But the rule that Judge Edwards prescribed -- and this is at page 793, I believe, of his concurrence -- was that individuals acting under color of law should be held liable. That's the precise language that the TVPA uses. So, if you want to know where Congress got the word \"individual\" and what it probably thought it meant, the best place to look is Judge Edwards' opinion. Now, what --",
  "Well, I think -- Justice Scalia, I think --",
  "Well, I think Judge -- Judge Edwards' opinion was quite prominently read by the Congress then. It's cited throughout the legislative history in the Senate Report, in the House Report, again and again in the hearings. And this Court -- I think in Skilling, a couple terms ago, this Court said we have a statute before us dealing with honest services. And what did Congress mean when it used particular language? Well, it probably meant what lower court judges had used that language to mean, that it was --",
  "Well, it's a strange --",
  "No, Justice Scalia --",
  "I think it's a strange -- it's a very strange phrase in the context of a tort statute because we know that Congress always provides for organizational liability, and it has never used, to our knowledge, the word \"individual\" in a tort statute. So, it is odd that it appears here.",
  "Well, I think it's better for us in that it shows that Congress -- something is amiss. And I think Judge Edwards' opinion explains what is going on. Now, what my opponents want this Court to do is to look at other places in the U.S. Code where the word \"individual\" is used outside of international law, outside of tort regimes. And we concede --",
  "-- often the word \"individual\" --",
  "No, it didn't.",
  "No, Justice Sotomayor, for two reasons: One is because, for reasons I'll explain, the word \"person\" as it appears in the TVPA actually only applies to natural persons. Well, let me start with that. The argument the other side has is that the word --",
  "Well, I think the -- I think the argument is that the word \"person\" somehow contrasts with \"individual.\"",
  "And, as we've shown in our brief, only natural people can bring wrongful death actions. They -- they claim -- in the D.C. Circuit argued that an estate could. As we've shown in our brief and this Court has squarely held, only natural people acting as administrator or executor of a -- of an estate can bring an action.",
  "So, the word \"person\" refers to natural person.",
  "We don't disagree with that's how the word gets into the statute, but the question, as this Court has always looked to legislative history, is what does that -- what light does that shed on Congress's understanding of the law it ultimately passed? So, two Congresses later, 4 years later, Congress passed the statute with the word \"individual.\" And the problem with that --",
  "And the problem with that theory, Justice Kagan, is it squarely is contradicted by the committee reports contemporaneous with the statute that say we're using the word \"individual\" to make crystal clear that foreign states and their entities cannot be sued. And that's the reason --",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, pages 46 through 49 of our blue brief, Justice Breyer. There are numerous references to the word \"organization,\" \"group.\" \"It\" is a word used. And, I think, Justice Kagan, this is also responsive to your question. Two years after the change you described was made, there was a hearing held before the Senate Judiciary Committee where both bills were being considered. The one bill from the House that used the word \"individual\" and the word -- and the Senate bill which used the word \"person.\" And one would expect that if people thought the word \"individual\" meant something different and limited the class of defendants, that that would have come up or somebody would have expressed some awareness of it. But to the contrary --",
  "Natural person, Justice Scalia. And -- and we've cited many statutes in our blue brief that use the word \"natural person\" in the U.S. Code. And this goes to the question -- I think this is also responsive to Justice Sotomayor: Why did they use the word \"individual,\" instead of \"person\"? Why did they say in the committee reports that the word \"individual\" made it crystal clear that states and their entities could not be sued? And the reason why is because \"person\" would have left some residual ambiguity as to whether something like a foreign city or a foreign county -- think of a foreign county jail that tortured somebody. Under section 1983 law, which uses the word \"person,\" counties and cities are liable. However, under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and under established international law sovereign immunities principles, they're not.",
  "The word \"individual\" --",
  "Well, I -- I respectfully submit they didn't think about that question, which is why I'm standing here today. What they were really concerned with was avoiding sweeping in foreign states and their -- and their -- and their entities.",
  "And they just didn't think.",
  "There are statements to that effect. And, of course, the TVPA does cover natural persons if they happen to be in the United States. But the comment that Justice Kagan pointed out is the only comment that the other side can find anywhere in the legislative history.",
  "Well, if the word \"individual\" could only mean natural person, I agree. The case would be over. But we've cited many dictionary definitions, many usages in the U.S. Code, and many holdings from this Court and others that have actually found that a secondary meaning of the term is singularity.",
  "A single unit or entity.",
  "Right. No tort statute uses it one way or the other, Justice Ginsburg, which we think, if anything, gets you back to the background norms and the secondary meaning. And let me say two things about --",
  "You don't.",
  "And I --",
  "I don't think it's that they have different meanings, but you're certainly correct that they refer to different things. But that's no different than numerous other statutes we cite at page 28 and 29 of our brief that use the word \"person\" to mean a plaintiff when it can be just -- be a natural person and a defendant when it can be an entity. And, indeed, I think, if I don't get ahead of my --",
  "Yes. Yes.",
  "Yes. Go to page 28 and 29 of the blue brief. And, indeed, their whole argument -- and, Justice Kagan, this goes back to your point. Their whole argument is when the word \"person\" was used throughout the statute, then it -- then it changed meanings in the same way, that it covered organizational entities, but -- so, if the word \"person\" can do the same work, the word \"individual\" can certainly do the same work. So, the question is why -- I think the question that you end up with is, given that \"individual\" does have this secondary meaning, does have this customary usage that Congress may well have been aware of, at least that as this Court often says that if there's a customary usage of a term, we'll assume Congress was aware of it, why would Congress have done what it did and limit this act, unlike any other Federal tort statute in the U.S. Code, to natural persons? And we submit there is no good reason. Justice Ginsburg, you talked about statements in legislative history to the effect that individual people who are torturers may be found in the United States, and that's true. But the TVPA is a tort statute. Congress already had on the books immigration laws and criminal laws that refuse safe haven to such people. The only purpose of the TVPA is to provide compensation. And in every tort regime of which we are aware in Federal law -- and they haven't even pointed to anything to the contrary in State law or in international law -- the way that you get compensation in tort regimes is you hold agents liable and you hold corporations liable for the acts of their agents. It's absolutely understood. And there's no good reason -- if you think of the three things that a tort statute is supposed to accomplish -- compensation, deterrence, and accountability -- on all three of those stands, the TVPA utterly falls flat if it cannot reach organizations, and this is the perfect case that shows you how that is. Just to start with remedies --",
  "Not --",
  "Well --",
  "That may -- in other cases, perhaps, but you don't find anything in this legislative history suggesting that organizations were --",
  "Well, I can't prove something that I don't have a piece of paper for, but --",
  "But if --",
  "Justice Scalia, one would expect to have found, over the 4 years this was debated and the hundreds of pages of legislative history, some clue that that's -- that that's what Congress was reacting to and thinking about. This would -- this would be an extraordinarily unusual statute, and you'd think that one person in the Congress that voted for it or in the committee reports that are contemporaneous would mention that. The House -- the Senate Report has a section called \"Who can be sued.\" And what it says -- I quoted it to you earlier. One would expect to find in that section that, unlike every other tort statute, we're restricting the people that can be sued, but they said instead --",
  "No, Justice Scalia, I agree that if the word \"individual\" can have no other meaning than that which my opponent suggests, that I lose. But I'm suggesting to you, and we've cited plenty of authority, that there's a secondary meaning both accepted in the U.S. Code and in cases, and in – and in international law.",
  "I think, Chief Justice, that that's exactly the thought process that Congress went through. And I can't do any better than to point you to pages --",
  "Exactly. That's our argument.",
  "And page 6 to 8 of our reply brief explains why that is so. I know -- I know it might be surprising, but if you read --",
  "If you read -- if you read the discourse --",
  "It does.",
  "Because it's more precise word in international law discourse than the word \"person\" for the reason I described before. If you look Judge Edwards' opinion --",
  "Pardon me?",
  "Well, except for -- remember, there's a state action requirement in the statute saying non-state actors --",
  "I mean, maybe there's other ways that Congress could have done it, but the way that Judge Edwards did it and the way that international law scholars and people having this conversation about whether people other than states ought to be liable under international law was the term that they always used. And it's not just -- you don't just -- you know, we're not running a West Law search looking for wherever we can find it. There in the titles of the articles is whether individuals are subject to liability.",
  "There are obviously cases to that effect, but I'm --",
  "I'm aware of other cases --",
  "Well, I think, for example, Justice Scalia, of the jurisprudence where I had an argument in this Court. It's about the second or successive petition rule under habeas law. And this Court has said \"second\" -- even though where \"second\" has an obvious ordinary meaning, it doesn't actually mean that. It has a specialized usage that accumulated in the law; and when Congress used that term, we incorporate that usage. And so, there is case after case where this Court has said -- the Morissette principle as a backdrop against common law, where this Court has said that you do look to usage in prior opinions, prior case law, prior discourse, as a way of infusing statutes with meaning. And if I could just go back to the question that I posed, which is why would Congress have done this when it -- it just doesn't have an answer for why Congress would do this in this particular statute. Now, the other side has given a few reasons why Congress might have --",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, if you find the statute at least somewhat ambiguous for the reasons I've described, then what Meyer and other cases say is you assume if Congress didn't think about it, but they wanted ordinary tort and agency principles, in the -- the -- in Title VII and many other cases, this Court has said, of course, Congress doesn't think about all these things; and when they don't, and absent evidence to the contrary --",
  "The --",
  "The question that Father Drinan was responding to was whether or not the TVPA ought to be extended to private entities that do not act under color of law.",
  "And at the time --",
  "Yes. If you look at that quote, remember, that hearing was held before the Oslo Accords, before the PLO became in our view a state actor. So, what he's saying, if you look at the quote in context, Justice Breyer, is that the TVPA shouldn't be drawn to sweep in groups that don't act under color of law. And that issue is not before this Court today. We've argued that the PLO now does act under color of law, and that's a question for remand. But that's --",
  "Well, of course, I was just responding to Justice Breyer's question as to that context. But -- but if you go even beyond compensation, you know, for compensation you have to identify somebody, you have to bring him into a court, and you have to enforce a judgment. That's virtually impossible against only natural people. Of course, Congress would have expected the ordinary rule of organizational liability. For deterrence, the Respondents' argument is that even if Pirates, Inc. -- and for this case we'll make it Torturers, Inc. -- were created for a policy of torturing people abroad, torturing American citizens who travel abroad, their argument is you could not hold that corporation liable, even under its express policy and purpose. There's no good reason under deterrence grounds why you'd let corporations or other organizations cycle individual actors in and out with impunity. And, finally, in terms of accountability, just think about the backdrop, again, with which this statute was created. There are some pretty horrible groups in the world that actually claim credit and responsibility in the world stage for torturing or killing American citizens; and the idea that Congress would have passed a statute that these organizations can stand proud in their view and say we've done this, and that our statute in the U.S. Code would -- would somehow only get their agent, and not the organization or entity itself, we submit it just doesn't make any sense.",
  "With respect, Justice Breyer, I would just say if you look back at the legislative history, the only conversation that was had is should we reach non-state actors. That was the only conversation that was had, and that's the conversation you referred to earlier. Nobody suggested that if you apply this extraterritorially if you enacted this statute, that you somehow ought to shirk from the ordinary rules of -- of organizational liability. Nobody suggested that.",
  "I don't think -- if I could beg your indulgence for one moment, I don't think I need to argue that because I think that for all the reasons I've given, there's enough ambiguity and there's good enough reasons why we would assume Congress meant the ordinary rule. But if I had to make that argument, I think I could because the only arguments that have been advanced in the papers are reasons for not having this extraterritorial statute in the first place. There's no good reason once you have it not to apply it to organizational actors. And, Justice Breyer, this goes back to your comment. It's still a mystery to me how it's more problematic in international relations to hold an organization accountable -- to not -- to hold organization accountable than to hold its -- its board of directors on a personal basis or to hold, indeed, a high official of a foreign government. Nobody's made that argument. And if I could say one thing and I'll reserve my time, take a good look at the United States' two briefs. Their -- the only argument they provide in of the Kiobel case is that there's no good reason -- that's -- that's the United States' terms -- why Congress would want to have a statute that applies only to judgment-proof individual actors and not to agents on whom they're acting on behalf of. And we think that's exactly right, and that's why Congress wouldn't have wanted that here. If I could reserve the remainder.",
  "I can make four points, if I may, Your Honor. First, when asked again and again why Congress would have done this, I think all I heard was that Congress wanted to adopt an incremental approach. And then Mr. Gannon said, well, maybe we also wanted to have moral accountability. Well, an incremental approach doesn't make any sense. Yes, Congress did so in the context of requiring exhaustion and a limitations period. And so, it treaded softly there. But there are numerous Federal statutes -- RICO, the Sherman Act, the Antiterrorism Act, which is quite similar to this act in many ways -- that apply to events abroad. And they all apply to organizations. So, if Congress was going to do this, there's no reason to think it wouldn't have wanted to do it. Ms. Ferguson pointed to the Dorelien case as the one example she could point of where a TVPA judgment was able to be enforced. And the only reason why that was able to be enforced is because that guy happened to win the Florida lottery. He had hidden all of his other assets abroad and won the Florida lottery. And is that the statute that Congress meant to pass? We don't think so. Moral accountability was already taken care of in the U.S. Criminal Code. There's an express provision of the U.S. Criminal Code that holds torturers liable for torturing abroad. And we've cited that in our briefs. I know some of you are going to look at the legislative history. So, let me say two quick things about the legislative history. First, Justice Kagan, with respect to Representative Leach's comment, if anyone after that hearing wanted to know what that committee thought the change it had made meant and what the bill meant, it would have looked at its report. And if we've cited -- we've cited the committee reports from the Foreign Relations Committee, and it says the TVPA allows liability for any person that commits torture. It uses the word \"person\" utterly interchangeably with the word \"individual.\" So, that -- whatever -- whatever moment happened 4 years before the enactment was long since lost. And the reason it used ultimately the word \"individual\" and not \"person,\" as I've described before, was to steer clear, I think, of any possibility of state entities. Mr. Gannon points to Monell, but Monell favors us. Monell holds that organizations can be liable. Now, there's a separate question that you talked about in the earlier argument, too, as to what the mens rea would be, whether it would have to be according to a policy or practice or whether it would be pure respondeat superior. But Monell is on our side in this case, and we've alleged a policy in our complaint in this case. Thirdly, in the U.S. Code, where the word \"individual\" is used, it obviously means natural persons lots of times. But when it does, it almost always uses the -- contrasts it in that very sentence with an entity or organization. And so, in discourse, when you say \"individuals\" or \"corporations,\" yes, you mean a natural person. But as the United States points out in footnote 3 of its own brief, the word \"individual\" when it's used alone is a less favored usage that actually gives rise to ambiguity because of the secondary meaning I've described before. And then, finally, let me say -- the questions were asked about the relationship between this case and the Kiobel case. And I think it's absolutely clear -- and this goes again to one of Justice Kagan's questions on absurdity -- if this Court holds that the Alien Tort Statute would have let a torturer right by Mr. Rahim, someone who is tortured, that is, bring a cause of action, I think it would indeed be absurd to imagine Congress stepping in and passing a statute saying if you're an American citizen, I'm sorry, you're out of luck; but if you happen to be lucky enough to be an alien and never having tried to be a citizen in this country, go ahead and bring a case in our courts. We think that would be absurd. So, with those points, if the Court has any further questions around the submissions I've made -- I guess the last thing I would say is, at the end of Mr. Gannon's argument, he referred to the interplay between the word \"individual\" and \"person\" in the briefs, and I can assure you from have having worked on this during the case, it is an incredible sideshow as to whether or not estates are people and all the ways that that works. But it's laid out in our brief, and we think that it's quite clear, that there is no disjoint between the word \"individual\" and \"person.\" If you look at our brief, it will explain why.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To be a vessel, a structure must be practically capable of maritime transportation, and this case turns on how to assess such practical capability. And that's a question this Court answered over a century ago in Cope and Perry, explaining that practical capability depends not on any physical attribute the structure might have, but rather, on \"its purpose,\" that is, whether its function is to move people or things across water. And that test has been applied numerous times before and since, across decades, providing stability and overall coherence to general maritime law. And of course - -",
  "Pardon me?",
  "Well, I think - -",
  "Practically capable.",
  "Well, that's not what this Court -- case is saying - -",
  "With all due respect, I don't think that's correct. In Evansville in 1926, this Court used that exact phrase, practical capability. And it assessed that practical capability by looking at \"the function of the structure.\" Again and again, in Evansville and other cases, this Court asked, was the function of the structure to carry people or things across water.",
  "Well, I think the word capable obviously is in the statute. And what this Court said as recently as Stewart is that capable - -",
  "Correct. And what this Court said in Stewart is that capable means practically capable, not theoretically capable. There's a range of how broad the word capable can be. And again, going back over a century, every single time this Court's been confronted with that question, it's used the term function to describe whether or not something is practically capable of carrying people or things over water.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I think there's a confusion of terminology that I hope I can - - that I hope I can straighten out at the outset. The term floating home is generally described to mean a residence that is designed to sit still and is not designed to carry people or things over water. The term houseboat is something that is self-propelled, generally moves people or things over water. What happened in the Sea Village Marina case, to my understanding, is the Court simply used the wrong term. It cited a lot of cases that held that houseboats, as we describe a houseboat as something that is designed to move its owner and the owner's things from here to there, are vessels. And we don't dispute that. But on the other hand, you have something called floating homes, which the brief filed by the Seattle and Sausalito floating homes associations give a very thorough description of what a floating home is and how it's different. And a primary way that it's different is that, as opposed to a houseboat, which is doing its function, it's doing its job when it's moving things from place to place, a floating home can't function when it's out in the water being towed. None of the utilities work, none of the power, no equipment is aboard to do anything - -",
  "Justice Kennedy, it would be indefinitely moored. That's the term this Court used in Stewart to describe whether something was being used to transport people or goods. It had said -- I have to emphasize that some of the assumptions we do in fact dispute in your hypothetical. But the fact that it sat still for three years performing its function as a stationary residence shows that it was indefinitely moored. The importance of indefinite mooring, though, I want to emphasize, is actually less important in this case than it might be if this were a dead ship case, where you had something that was concededly a vessel - -",
  "-- in the question - -",
  "It would still not be a vessel. And you don't have to look any further than this Court's Evansville case.",
  "Well, I'm not sure if you'd use the term indefinitely moored at that point, but it certainly wouldn't be transformed into a vessel because look at this Court's Evansville case. The structure - -",
  "I think that's right if you start with something that is a vessel; the fact that you simply leave it at the dock for a long time doesn't take away vessel status. That's what this Court held in Stewart. But if you start with something that isn't a vessel -- and I give you the Roper case, which did have a raked bow; it was an old Liberty ship that everybody agreed had been decommissioned and turned into a non-vessel. Then, they brought it in, they towed it -- Justice Ginsburg, they towed it -- they loaded it up with grain. Towed it again, let it sit still for a couple years, towed it back, unloaded the grain. And this Court said, it's not a vessel. And why did this Court say it's not a vessel? And I will quote from the opinion. It said: \"Because unlike a barge, the Harry Lane was not moved in order to transport commodities from one place to another; it served as a mobile warehouse performing its function of storing grain.\" In the Evansville's case - -",
  "No. Purpose is the overall question. The way where - -",
  "That helps you determine its purpose. So the word -- where the word indefinite comes from, Justice Sotomayor, is from the Stewart case, where this Court cited the Fifth Circuit's Pavone case with approval, which had held that an indefinitely moored floating casino was not a vessel.",
  "We're talking about an objective purpose, Justice Alito - -",
  "Exactly. And I'm doing -- if I can just say this directly, I'm trying to do exactly what this Court did in Cope and Evansville and Roper. The exact analysis this Court applied in those cases is precisely what we want this Court to apply here. But I think what we're - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Correct.",
  "The word vessel in the Maritime Lien Act, which is what provides the Federal forum, assertedly, for the plaintiff, the City, to bring this case. So the word vessel is -- is its jurisdictional and substantive hook. Justice Sotomayor, if I can return to your question about indefinite mooring, the importance of indefinite mooring in this case, where you have something that was not a vessel to begin with, is simply to ask whether it's been transformed into a vessel, exactly as this Court asked in Roper. So is it being used for its function for which it was created and - -",
  "I'm not trying to beg the question; I'm just trying to describe our argument to you. There are some cases where - -",
  "I hope not. I'm trying to distinguish between two lines of cases, one being where you have things that were -- like the Roper case, that were made as boats, as vessels undisputedly, and now the question is whether they've been pulled out of navigation; as opposed to another set of cases, which we believe this falls into, where the question itself is whether this was ever a vessel. In those kinds of cases, the indefinite mooring shows that it's being used for its function. It hasn't -- for example, if I could give a hypothetical, maybe it would help, imagine a piece of floating dock. Now, under their test, that would be a vessel because you can unhook the dock, load it up with stuff and tow it around, if a company wanted to use that as a makeshift barge. But no maritime case has ever held that a floating dock is a vessel. But if somebody did that, then it would no longer be indefinitely moored and would be using a different function and might be transformed into a - -",
  "It absolutely does because the function of a boat is to move people or things over water. So when it's sitting still, Justice Alito, it's not performing its function.",
  "Yes, it is. In addition - -",
  "No, this Court in Stewart rejected the snapshot test that I think is what you just described. The question is whether what -- whether it has the function of moving people and things over water or not. Now, some casinos go up and down the river - -",
  "If it actually does the latter and is performing its function while moving, then it is a vessel. And that's what this Court held in Stewart. There's not a primary purpose test. If one of its purposes is to move people or things over water, then it's a vessel. But that's not the purpose of a floating home. That's not the purpose of a floating restaurant or something else that might be float - -",
  "But you could tie it up and move it.",
  "Well, with all due respect, Justice Kagan, that's not why people have floating homes. The amicus brief explains that. Don't look at -- but you don't have to look any further than the history of this. The only two times it moved any significant distance were: One, when it changed ownership; and two, when a hurricane struck, so it had to be moved. And look at your own cases. In Pavone, which this Court cited with approval in Stewart, that structure moved hundreds of miles over several years. This Court said not a vessel. The structure in Evansville moved three different ways. It moved up and down the Mississippi-Ohio River as it changed ownership several times over the course of 14 years. It also moved every winter to avoid the ice that would come in. And thirdly it was repositioned on literally almost a daily basis to accord with the stages of the river. And again, applying this Court's well settled function test, this Court said that's not a vessel.",
  "Well, the important - -",
  "It would sound to me just like the floating warehouse and office in Evansville as I just described that case. But Justice Kennedy, let me say one more thing before I reserve my time.",
  "If it's simply being repositioned and not being used for a transportation purpose, that is to move people or things, then it's not a vessel. And that's exactly what this Court - -",
  "That is not the point, Justice Kennedy, with all due respect. There's a difference between a floating home and a houseboat, and I urge you to look at the briefs on this point. And this comes right back to your question - -",
  "Other floating commercial - -",
  "Well, I'm not sure they can actually disavow that on their tests, but - -",
  "Floating commercial establishments, floating pieces, floating docks, floating trampolines and play structures. And, Justice Kennedy, if I could just answer your question and reserve the rest of my time. The importance of the connecting of the utilities and the water hose, which was actually a specialized water hose, not a garden hose, but the importance of those connections is found in State codes across the country that distinguish between floating homes and houseboats, asking whether they're dependent on those connections to operate. A floating home cannot function if it's not tied to land. It doesn't matter how many amps we want to fight about, it's whether it needs that power from land, whether it needs those connections to land. A houseboat, like any other vessel, can fully function away from port. If I can reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Thank you. I think Mr. Frederick's best argument that I've heard, and some of this Court has echoed it, is that this is a vessel because it was moved around and it carried his personal effects. The difficulty is that argument runs absolutely headlong into Evansville and Roper; it cannot be squared with those cases. And I would be willing to rest my entire case on simply this Court reading and applying those cases. In Evansville, this Court dealt with something that carried around the effects of a business office. In Roper, this Court dealt with something that carried around grain and was far more seaworthy than the structure in this case. Both instances, the Court said they're not vessels because the function was not to carry those things around, it was merely -- they were merely incidental relocations. Now -- so for that reason, the Eleventh Circuit simply cannot be right when it says that function is irrelevant. And the City can't be right on its test either. The only way the City has proposed to deal with those cases is to look at how securely the structure is fashioned. And Justice Kagan, you're exactly right. If you want a recipe for disaster on jurisdictional questions, start asking whether it's chains or ropes. And not only that, if you want something that's utterly manipulable, just tell the yacht owner who has his yacht down in the harbor that all he has to do is hook it up to the dock with chains instead of ropes and now he's out of maritime jurisdiction. So this Court's cases for almost a century have applied the exact test we're asking this Court to apply. And even if you're not 100 percent persuaded that that's what the statute is best read as doing, that is what we have done for over 100 years, and that is how maritime law has built up and guaranteed on those -- on those understandings. And it's not just the questions we've been talking today -- it's employment law, tort law, all the rest are built on this test. And we're asking this Court simply to reaffirm what it's done in the past. So I think that leaves the question of, when you know the Eleventh Circuit applied the wrong test and you know the City's test can't be right, do you vacate or do you send -- or do you simply reverse? And we think -- Justice Kennedy, we think that you can simply reverse. You have everything in the record you need, most notably in the surveyor's report. And you can look at four things. Look at the -- look at the materials used, the shape of the structure, its equipment and the utilities. The materials used were plywood and ordinary land-based structures.",
  "I'm -- I'm not saying any of these are determinative, Mr. Chief Justice, but it's a totality that tells you what it is. And the next thing is the shape. Exactly as you referred. This is a rectangle that sits 10 inches under the water, is not meant to be moved around. Look at the -- look at its features. It has French doors on three sides a few feet above the water line. That's not what a vessel -- not how a vessel is designed. And finally, its utilities. Again, at Joint Appendix 40, for example, it says this thing has no batteries. It is utterly dependent on being hooked up to land. That's the only way it can function. So if this Court does nothing else between now and casting its vote and writing its opinion, revisit this Court's prior cases and reassert the rule that this Court has always applied.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the more than 20 years since this Court decided Teague v. Lane, it's had more than a dozen cases in which people have sought habeas relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel, but this Court has never once held that applying Strickland in those divergent factual settings constituted a new rule. For two reasons, this Court should reject the government's argument to do so for the first time here. First, Padilla was dictated by precedent; that is, like other Strickland cases that came before it, this Court in Padilla simply applied Strickland's formula of assessing attorney performance according to prevailing professional norms to a new set of facts. The second - -",
  "No, I don't think so, Your Honor. Two -- two things about the lower courts. The first is, there are only three lower court decisions that postdate the 1996 act that the government can cite that came out the other way in terms of the question presented here. And the second thing is, even within those cases and within those courts, they didn't distinguish between deportation advice and other kinds of advice. They distinguished between acts and omissions; that is to say, it was a uniform rule in the lower courts at the time this Court decided Padilla that misadvice concerning the right to -- I'm sorry, concerning deportation consequences of a plea did violate Strickland. So the distinction in lower courts was not between deportation advice and other kinds of advice; the distinction was between acts and omissions. And in Padilla itself --",
  "No --",
  "Well, obviously, there was a dissent in Padilla, but this Court has held before that new applications of Strickland did not constitute a new rule, even though there were dissents.",
  "In Williams --",
  "Well, that was obviously the argument that the State of Kentucky made in that case, and this Court dealt with it in part two of Padilla. Now, remember, Justice Ginsburg, the Court did not extend Strickland to collateral consequences in Padilla. It actually reserved that question. What it held is that deportation consequences are not removed from the ambit of the Sixth Amendment. So, remember, Strickland - -",
  "I think -- I think that's an open question after Padilla. What this Court held in Padilla -- and this is the second to last sentence in part two -- is that advice concerning deportation consequences of a guilty plea are not categorically removed from the Sixth Amendment. So what I understood the Court to do in Padilla was take the ordinary Strickland formula of prevailing professional norms and simply apply it to this criminal case. Remember, Padilla itself was a criminal case.",
  "Of course not. The question this Court asked under Teague is whether it broke new ground. And I think what this Court said in Padilla is, we reject the artificial restriction on Strickland that the lower courts have created; so, therefore, this Court simply reaffirmed Strickland. It didn't --",
  "I think you -- you may well find that, Justice Kagan, but the reason why is because you'd find that there was not an unreasonable application of preexisting law. What you would not say is that the clearly established law is any different. So, remember, this Court -- this case, because it's a Federal case, raises only the first question under AEDPA, in a sense, which is what's the clearly established law? And this is the Chief -- I think this is responsive to the Chief Justice's question about the dissent. There was a disagreement on this Court about how to apply Strickland, but the question's whether a new legal rule was created, not whether there was an unreasonable application --",
  "Well, I think the best response is what this Court said in Williams, which is Strickland provides sufficient guidance to resolve virtually every ineffective assistance claim. So what this Court said in Williams is we do not make new law when we apply Strickland. I think Justice Kennedy --",
  "I think so long as you simply applied Strickland, you wouldn't create a new rule. If you for example, said, a certain kind of claim does not need to have a prejudice showing, that would be a new rule.",
  "Justice Kennedy, it wouldn't be enough to have a later evolution of prevailing norms because Strickland is a backward-looking device.",
  "Well, I think the answer to that question is yes, and, as I said, something like a scenario where this Court --",
  "Well, let me -- let me try to work with your hypothetical. I think what I hear your hypothetical to say is that prevailing norms change, and they evolve to a certain point where certain kinds of advice is required, which is much what this Court said in Padilla about -- about deportation advice. You would have -- you would not have a new rule to simply recognize that at the time that attorney gave advice, that -- that Strickland was violated. It would be a new rule, I think, Justice Kennedy, to say that Strickland requires relief, even though at the time the advice was given the prevailing norm had not yet crystalized into the degree that this Court requires.",
  "No, I think what I'm trying to say is --",
  "-- Strickland -- Strickland sets up a two-part test, and we're only talking about the first part, which is attorney performance. And that -- that question is keyed to attorney performance at the time judged by reasonableness according to prevailing professional norms. Now, those prevailing professional norms are, in a sense, a factual question, an empirical question that --",
  "Well, let me give you two answers to that, because I think that's the government's main argument here. First is, as I've tried to say before, simply saying that an exception that the lower courts created doesn't exist -- doesn't create a new rule. Imagine this Court said -- laid down a rule that covered all cars, and the lower courts devised an exception to that rule for convertibles. And when the Court -- when the issue came to this Court, this Court said, well, no, when we said all cars, we meant all cars. To me, that doesn't create a new rule. And I think that's what this Court said in part two of Padilla, is that this artificial restriction that the lower courts have devised simply can't be grounded in Strickland --",
  "Pardon me?",
  "Only three federal circuits had had a ruling like that after the 1996 act --",
  "Well, if I can finish my answer, only three had rulings like that after the 1996 act, and all three of those relied on pre-'96 act rulings. And as court of appeals judges said, that's just not quite enough for us to be entitled to overturn our prior circuit precedent. So while the government comes here today and suggests that ten circuits and all these state courts had ruled, in a sense, in its favor, you know, it's almost more accurate to say none had had this issue cleanly presented to them after the 1996 act. And, Justice Kagan, if I --",
  "That may well be true, Justice Kagan, but I'm saying in the '96 act, as this Court said in Padilla, whatever prevail -- whatever doubt there may have been about prevailing professional norms crystallized at that time because of the severity. And I think that's the second answer I wanted to give to your question about this so-called threshold question in Padilla, is that even if there is some question as to whether the Sixth Amendment applies beyond, as the government puts it, criminal jeopardy, this Court had already answered that question in St. Cyr, where this Court said, in the text around footnotes 48 and 50, that any competent lawyer would give his client advice and a warning about deportation consequences of a plea. So even if you needed more than Strickland itself, St. Cyr gave that to you in 2001, which is enough to decide this case; it was enough to decide Padilla.",
  "I think it would -- I doubt it, Justice Alito. I think it would depend on what the prevailing professional norms looked like. I take it what this Court said in Strickland and what it reaffirmed in Padilla is, we're not going to -- we're not going to micromanage effective assistance of counsel. We're going to leave it to prevailing professional norms. I seriously doubt that prevailing professional norms would require the holding that you described; but, to the extend they did, I don't think it would be a new rule. To the extent they didn't and this Court said, we're going to push the Sixth Amendment beyond that, you would have a new rule.",
  "That's a tricky question to answer, Justice Scalia.",
  "Well, I think I could answer it one of two ways. One is I could say yes, they did -- to the extent they did regard it as a new rule, I think the dissent was, with all due respect, slightly mistaken about what the holding in Padilla was, which was not to --",
  "Well, I think that the way the dissent put it was -- is that advice is now required beyond criminal cases and criminal jeopardy. The way that I think Padilla -- majority described its holding was that this is a criminal defendant in a criminal case entitled to advice from his criminal lawyer, and the most important piece of advice as to whether to take a plea or not involves deportation consequences. And, Justice Scalia, I think --",
  "Well, it had to be more than that, Justice Kennedy, because, of course, there is lots of --",
  "-- ineffective assistance cases –-",
  "Well, no, no. But I'm saying there are lots of ineffective assistance cases before Padilla that involved matters beyond the judge, that turned on what the jury did, of course. And I could -- I may be able to think of others beyond those two scenarios, but there's no language to that effect in Padilla. What the Court said is that we have never created artificial distinctions about what an attorney has to do. As this Court put it in Strickland, Strickland itself, the client is advised to his lawyer's advice about all important decisions. And as this Court said in St. Cyr and other cases, the most important consideration as to whether to plead guilty is whether somebody will be deported. And so you put that together and you had all of the law you needed, certainly by 2001.",
  "Well, some sort of consequences that -- that prevailing norms didn't require a lawyer to advise his client on. So, for example, I would expect that a lawyer is not necessarily required to give detailed advice about future employment opportunities to a client depending on whether he pleads guilty.",
  "It -- I think it would be an open question as to how Strickland would apply.",
  "I simply don't know what the prevailing professional norms are in that situation.",
  "Well, I would start with --",
  "Yes, that's what I would do. And I would look to prevailing professional norms. And I think, if I could give a generic answer, the question would be whether or not that kind of advice is so important to the client's decision making -- and that's the word the Court used in Strickland -- that prevailing norms require the lawyer to give that kind of advice. If the answer to that was yes --",
  "No, no, Justice Kennedy.",
  "No, I don't think it does, Justice Kennedy. I agree with your premise, I think, that prevailing professional norms can and do evolve. And so the question this Court asked in Strickland is, as of the time the advice was given, did the prevailing norms require that? The advice was given in this case almost at the identical time of the advice in Padilla and, indeed, far after St. Cyr.",
  "Well, I'm not sure that's what the ABA said. I believe the ABA, quite rightly, said, we don't make constitutional law in this body; we leave that to the courts.",
  "Well, I think there may be elements of the standards that did. But, remember, we're not just talking about the ABA here. As this Court noted in Padilla and as one of the amicus briefs from NACDL notes in this case, there's a wide --",
  "Well, then I'll rely on just the overall body of professional norms, which is what this Court looked to in Padilla and what it's always said it has to look to under Strickland cases. If I could return -- if I could transition to talking about the -- the nature of the backward-looking effect of Strickland, I think there is an important second question in this case, that if this Court were inclined to hold that there was a new rule, you'd be forced to confront. And it's a very serious question involving this Court's administration of criminal appellate procedure. And that is whether Teague ought to apply at all in this context. We believe that under the system this Court established in Massaro for handling IAC claims, it simply doesn't make any sense to apply Teague here and, indeed, would throw a gigantic monkey wrench into the way things are -- have been done for the last decade after that decision. And -- and for two reasons: One, in theory --",
  "Yes.",
  "Sure. We didn't forfeit this argument. It's fairly included within our question presented. We raised it at the first available opportunity in the Seventh Circuit because we were foreclosed by circuit precedent from raising it. So we raised it before an en banc court. And in our cert reply brief, lest there be any doubt, when the government suggested that we would be restricted to arguing the new rule question in this case, we put a footnote in our cert reply brief which expressly told the Court, no, we view this question presented as including this additional argument, whether Teague applies or not. So I think we gave fair notice to the Court. And if you have any doubt --",
  "We made the argument in an en banc petition to the Seventh Circuit, which we couldn't make it to a panel because Seventh Circuit law had already held that Teague applied in this context.",
  "No. I think we agree with the government that it doesn't -- matter. The way we see this is it's a first Federal filing. It's a first post-conviction filing, and it's a timely filing. The government is not challenging the timeliness of this filing. So the question you have to ask yourself is, under a system where this Court has said that IAC claims should not be brought on direct review, but rather should be brought on collateral review, whether you can apply Teague at the very first instance that somebody has to make a constitutional claim, and we think not. On theory --",
  "Well, that's the way the whole case has been litigated, and I think that's a fair assumption. The reason that we're on coram nobis instead of --",
  "No, you haven't. And so if you want to be extra careful, you can -- you can say the parties haven't challenged that. Remember, the reason that we're on coram nobis is Ms. Chaidez was not in custody. And so if somebody -- so it's, in a sense, interchangeable with a 2255.",
  "More severe in the sense -- I'm not sure I understand in what sense.",
  "I'm not sure they -- I'm not sure they could, Justice Alito. At Pet. App. 38, you'll see the district court dealing with the timeliness of this petition. And the district court finds that Ms. Chaidez could proceed because she used all reasonable diligence in bringing this claim. And the government can make laches arguments, can make other arguments to defeat that. The government has renounced those -- I mean, they let those arguments go in the Seventh Circuit and don't raise them again here. But I think that, at a minimum, it would be fair to say that somebody needs to bring a petition as soon as the government advises them they're going to seek deportation. I'm not even sure, Justice Alito --",
  "You could -- you could have a time lag, but there is two things to remember. First is, you might have a timely 2255 in that circumstance, too, because, remember, in Holland v. Florida, this Court held that equitable tolling is available for people with IA -- with ineffective assistance that leads to them not being able to make the claim earlier. And the second thing is, as I was discussing with Justice Kennedy, the backward-looking aspect of Strickland would -- would require the party -- once you get more than a little while back, the prevailing norms may not -- may not be there for that kind of a claim.",
  "And so that's --",
  "No, I think you could hold that, and that is -- that is within our argument. I don't think you need to go that far, Justice Ginsburg. As you said, this Court has said time and again that Teague relies on comity. That's not present in this case. But we think a narrower way to decide this case, and I think the appropriate way to decide this case, is to say, at least for ineffective assistance claims, when you're bringing -- with a Federal prisoner, or somebody who has been convicted of a Federal crime, that's bringing their first petition, that Teague can't apply. And what I was just trying to say is Strickland itself --",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, I'm glad you asked because that was what I was going to say. In Strickland, this Court dealt with finality very explicitly and said, we're creating this standard which is different than other constitutional standards because we're concerned about finality. And, as this Court said at pages 697 and 98, so, therefore, no different rules ought to apply in collateral proceedings as in direct review, because this Court assumed in Strickland itself and it assumed expressly again in Padilla that all of these claims would be on collateral review. So in all these cases the Court has said finality -- the concern -- the very concern you mentioned, Justice Kennedy, is already baked into the Strickland formula.",
  "Well --",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay. Let me answer both those things. First, we’re not asking this Court to create an exception to Teague. We’re simply asking this Court to say Teague doesn't apply when a claim is, quote, \"on the equivalent of direct review,\" which is what this Court said in Martinez v. Ryan. This Court has already held with respect to IAC that habeas rules, like the procedural default rule and like the Stone v. Powell bar against Fourth Amendment claims, don’t apply in the IAC context. So this follows exactly from those previous holdings. Now, let me say two other things and then I can hopefully reserve my time. To answer your question about Martinez in state cases, it would depend on what the state system looked like, and I think states have their own decision to make as to whether they want a system like Arizona's, where these have to be brought in collateral proceedings, or whether, as I understand at least a couple of states do, say, we're going to stay and delay the entire direct review process, for years often, to allow the IAC claim to be brought then. Now, that's exactly what this Court rejected in Massaro, and the government asked this Court to reject that in Massaro; said we don't want that kind of a system. I don't know why the government is asking for it for the first time today. And finally remember, the last thing I would like to say is, all these problems raise not only finality concerns about the stay and remand procedures the government suggests; they also raise insoluble conflicts of interest problems for federal defender offices, who would have to bring IAC claims against themselves on direct review in order to preserve their ability to -- to get full relief for their client.",
  "Justice Kennedy, what I would like to do, and I am happy to elaborate, is the formulation as I think you yourself put it in Wright v. West, which is that a rule that is -- that is applied to a new set of facts does not create a new rule; but if you advance the law in some way you do create a new rule. The last thing I would like to say about consequences is: Remember, the government doesn't even have any answer for what is going to be half or more of the situations where people have Padilla-type claims, which is when they have a guilty plea and waive their right to direct appeal. So there the collateral filing like this is -- is absolutely the equivalent of direct review. And so I think this Court ought to be very wary of going down that road. If I could reserve the time I have left.",
  "Thank you. I'd like to make two points. The first is, picking up where Mr. Dreeben left off, I'm not asking for any anything that is difficult. Mr. Dreeben referred to the Frady case, where this Court held that there is enough of an interest in finality to have procedural default apply to federal post-conviction review. Yet, in Massaro, this Court carved out IAC claims. Exactly the same analysis applies here, and I do think the Court really ought to answer that question in this case because, if you hold that Padilla is a new rule and that Teague now applies to IAC claims, rest assured the Federal courthouses are going to be flooded, flooded with Federal -- with Federal defenders and other criminal lawyers raising IAC claims on direct review. There'd be nothing else a responsible lawyer could do, because if you say Teague applies on -- if you wait until collateral review, but it doesn't apply on direct review, any responsible lawyer seeking to protect his client has to bring it on direct review. It's going to absolutely change the way criminal procedure and criminal appellate procedure happens in the Federal court system. The second point I wanted to make is back to the new rule question. I think I heard Mr. Dreeben say that the lower courts that had said that misadvice about deportation consequences violated Strickland had said something that was within Strickland that didn't constitute a new rule. So it can't be that Strickland broke new ground, if he's correct, by saying deportation advice falls within the ambit of the Sixth Amendment in a guilty plea context. The only thing he relies on in the end is this distinction the lower courts had drawn between acts and omissions. And that's exactly the distinction in Strickland that this Court rejected. And in Padilla itself, this Court used the word absurd. And I think, Justice Kennedy, when you mentioned commonsense, I think we could throw that in, too. And so to the extent that the argument, at the end of the day when everything's stripped away, is that the lower courts were reasonable in saying that failing to advise about the most important thing a client would have been thinking as to whether to plead guilty is not ineffective assistance of counsel, whereas giving bad advice is, that's a line that Strickland itself rejected, that Flores-Ortega rejected when it came to the right to appeal and whether the lawyer ought to give advice; and, it's a line that this Court in Padilla had no difficulty whatsoever rejecting and called it absurd.",
  "Yes.",
  "No, it's not, Justice Sotomayor. The issue arises because Teague ordinarily comes into play when somebody asks the Court to create a new rule and apply it to him. So all the hypotheticals we've talked about today, about would Strickland apply here, would Strickland apply there, to parole advice, to professional license, all of those claims would be asking, if the government's correct, for a new rule.",
  "And so all of those claims would have to be brought. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It seems to me, in light of the recent events, that the most appropriate course for this Court is to just simply dismiss this case as improvidently granted. If this Court had reached its -- had gotten a cert petition under the circumstances present right now, it seems to me there'd be three very strong reasons simply just to deny the petition. First of all, because EPA, in its rulemaking on Friday afternoon, itself says that the Ninth Circuit decision has -- cancels out any impact of the Ninth Circuit decision on the ground, moving forward. Second of all, the case is interlocutory in posture. Remember, we are just on a reversal of a motion to dismiss. So every argument that's left in the case, in addition to whatever mootness arguments anyone wants to make -- which I'll explain why in a moment we would disagree with -- can all be made on remand to the Ninth Circuit. And if people are unhappy -- or not on remand, but just simply when the case returns -- if people are unhappy with those results, they can bring the case back up to this Court. And -­",
  "Well, if that's where the case ends up when it's over and they bring it back and you deny cert -­",
  "But there's a much -­",
  "No.",
  "But that's my point, yes. And -- but I want to make one thing very clear.",
  "Well, the law of the case would be -­",
  "All the district court must do under the Ninth Circuit decision is consider this to be a point source, for the reason that Justice Sotomayor mentioned, and that -- the other side has virtually walked away from that argument, anyway. It is pipe, ditch, or channel; it's perfectly obvious we're dealing with point sources here. The only question is whether you have this covered by the stormwater rules, to the extent they are valid. And that -- the district court or the Ninth Circuit or whoever would consider in the first instance, and that could come back to this Court. But if I might just explain to this Court, I think it will help the conversation if I explain exactly what our case looks like, going forward, because we have and will maintain a claim for forward-looking relief for two reasons. One is, for the reason that was mentioned a couple of times in the -- in the beginning part of the argument, because we contend that the new rule simply violates the statute. And we have a right to bring a citizen suit for a violation of the Clean Water Act itself, which is to say the language that requires EPA to regulate -­",
  "-- all discharges associated with industrial activity.",
  "Well, I wouldn't put it exactly that way, Justice Sotomayor. What I would say is that we have the power to bring -- or we have the right to bring a citizen suit to enforce the Act. And if there is a regulation that the other side brings up that says, we are -- supposedly says, we are exempt from having to get permits, our position is that regulation just simply doesn't fall under 1369(b)(1), for the reasons Judge Pryor just found for the Eleventh Circuit. I sent that up as supplemental authority.",
  "It is, A -­",
  "That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. The Ninth Circuit had no -- no reason to reach it because the regulations on stormwater, as then written, were absolutely clear, that logging activities -­",
  "I think the most prudent thing, as I've said, is for this Court not to reach that, and to let -- as you described, to let a lower court look at it first and to bring it back. But if I can finish my question -- or my answer to Justice Sotomayor, the reason why that regulation doesn't require us to go to court of appeals in the first instance and actually lets us proceed on a citizen suit is because the only two subsections of 1369(b)(1) that they have mentioned are subsections (E) and (F). Subsection (F) deals with EPA decisions, quote, \"issuing or denying a permit.\" Well, this decision does neither of those things. Secondly, it covers EPA actions that set effluent levels or effluent limitations. And, again, for the reasons the Eleventh Circuit just held and other courts have held, this doesn't do that either. So there is nothing in 1369(b)(1) that stands in our way of bringing a citizen suit to enforce the statute on those terms. So -­",
  "Well, I think that what -- what we'll do is proceed whatever way we can because our -­ you know, either -- either we are supposed to go directly to the Ninth Circuit -- or any court of appeals, or we are not. And if we are, then we will; and if we're not supposed to go to the court of appeals, as we believe a fair reading of the law -- I don't think there is any plain text meaning of the law that could go otherwise -- then we have -- the only way we can do this is through a citizen suit.",
  "Exactly. And that's what the Eleventh Circuit just held in a case just like this, where there was a regulation at issue that exempted certain discharges from the permitting program. And the Eleventh Circuit said, case dismissed. You can't bring this directly to us. So we have an -- an ongoing claim for a violation of the statute, which I can't imagine this Court would want to address in the first instance. We also, it's important to understand, have a second claim. And before I describe that second claim, let me describe overall -- just remind the Court what exactly the case is about. The case isn't about, as the other side has -- has portrayed many times, all logging roads, all logging roads that may exist in the world -- or the United States. What the case is about are two very specific kinds of logging roads: One, logging roads that drain themselves by way of pipes, ditches, and channels, only the small subset of logging roads that do that; and second of all, only logging roads used -- being used for active timber harvesting and hauling, not roads that just happen to be sitting in the forest not being used, but only the small subset of logging roads being used for active timber cutting and harvesting.",
  "It means under -­",
  "Well -- well -­",
  "No, Justice Scalia. And so under this -- the facts of this case, remember, we're on a motion to dismiss, so when Mr. Bishop says 1 or 2 weeks out of whatever, we would like to have a record on that because we don't think that's the reality. But what -- what the case -- what we say in our complaint is that they have a contract with the State of Oregon to harvest particular areas and use particular roads to access that timber and to take it out. And the -- and the contract actually requires them to use those roads and to maintain their drainage systems. And so our claim -- again, just to remind you what our claim is under the statute -- is that that harvesting activity can't be thought of in any other way than industrial in nature and that these roads are associated with that activity. They are designed for that purpose, and they're indispensable to the activity. Now, we have a second argument. Even if the Court thought that we couldn't win -- or a -- whatever court looks at this -- thought we couldn't win on the statute, we have a Chevron Step II argument that we will make and have every right to make because if -- and I'll beg this Court's indulgence -- if -- this rule that they have just announced on Friday afternoon is not as clear as you might think. So if you start with the language of the rule, which is on page 18, what they have done is they have amended -- they have amended the stormwater rules to -- to provide that the only industrial activities associated with logging are sawmills, which are covered elsewhere, and then these four categories of things: Rock crushing, gravel washing, log sorting, and log storage. All -­",
  "It's page 18, the last page of -- at least, I'm -- I hope your copy is the same as mine, but on the PDF that -- that was sent up to the Court.",
  "Yes. And if you go all the way to the bottom, sub 2, \"facilities classified under",
  "And they list those four things. And -- and then industry -- industry group 242 is the sawmills. So they are saying those are the only industrial activities that are associated with logging. But that doesn't answer our claim. Our claim isn't that logging roads themselves are industrial activities. Our claim is that logging roads are associated with industrial activities. And so we still have a claim that, under that -- even if those are the only four industrial activities -- or, sorry, five, those four things plus sawmills -- we still have a claim that logging roads are, quote, \"immediate access roads\" to those activities. And the definition of \"immediate access roads,\" which is unchanged by the new regulation, is at Pet. App. 40a -- the Ninth Circuit quoted it, and I think it was described earlier by my friend -- \"Roads which are exclusively or primarily dedicated for the use by the industrial facility.\" So it's still a mystery to us how logging roads are not primarily for use by even sawmills or these other four things. And, indeed, if you look very carefully at EPA's new regulation in the preamble, on page 6, about two-thirds of the way down the middle of the page, the only sentence here that EPA gives us, that even suggests a possible response to the argument I just described is the one that begins with the word \"unlike.\" They say, \"Unlike immediate access roads associated with industrial activities, many logging roads\" -- \"many logging roads have multiple uses, including recreation and general transportation, and commonly extend over long distance, i.e., may not provide immediate access to an industrial site.\" So EPA is leaving open our argument. EPA is saying, well, logging roads that are just generally recreational, et cetera, are not immediate access roads. But our claim -­",
  "Well, that's what they are standing here today saying. But I'm telling you, on the language that they gave us on Friday, it doesn't moot the case. And I can't imagine an argument being made on Monday, that hasn't been prepared in any written form, based on a written thing that we got on Friday, that we have an argument under, would moot our case. And particularly, Mr. Chief Justice -- and this is my point about going through all this -- I can't imagine why this Court would want to touch all this in the first instance, particularly without supplemental briefing, but it seems to me to make every sense to let the Ninth Circuit address our arguments first.",
  "Yes.",
  "No, because we have a forward look at the -- the first thing we'll tell the Ninth Circuit is -­",
  "I think only as to the backward-looking regulation, but now, we have -- our complaint -- you know, as a citizen suit does -­",
  "Well, I -- I think that gets you very close to the same place, Justice Kennedy. I'm just saying there is no reason to vacate because the Ninth Circuit's point-source holding is so self-evidently right, that I don't know why you'd go to the trouble to do that. It makes the case simpler going forward.",
  "Do you mean the backward-looking ruling?",
  "Right.",
  "Well, I don't know that they would reconsider that -­",
  "-- but the -- but the main event going forward is the new rule because the citizen suit seeks cessation of ongoing violations of the Act, and that remains the core of our lawsuit, which is still seeking damages -­",
  "It doesn't matter very much, Justice Sotomayor. There is two ways in which it might matter a little bit. One is, if we want to press a claim for any kind of civil penalties or remediation, the backward-looking thing would matter. We have to decide whether we want to do that. The second way it would matter would be it would provide a helpful baseline for judging the new rule in the totality of EPA action, which brings me to my -- which brings me back to the argument I was describing, which would be our Chevron Step II argument, that EPA has simply either left this argument open -- I still -- it is still a mystery to us what EPA thinks about our real argument, which is that active hauling logging roads, when they are being used for active harvesting and hauling, are subject to the Act because they are plainly associated with industrial activity. And if EPA later on came out and said, no, no, no, we mean to exclude that, too, then we respectfully submit, EPA would still have a lot of explaining to do. First of all, we would very much wonder why log sorting, log storage, gravel washing, and rock crushing are industrial activities, but mechanized timber harvesting with 20-ton pieces of machinery is not. We'd also wonder why this stuff isn't industrial activity, where construction activity, landfill operations, surface mining operations that have all the same attributes of being done out in the field, extraction of resources, heavy machinery, et cetera, are, as the EPA itself admits, industrial activity; but, somehow -- somehow, logging, which has all the same attributes, isn't. And so that's what our claim is going forward. Now, I'm not asking this Court to address that because I'm not sure this Court wants to get into all of this stuff yet; but what I am telling this Court is, there is no basis whatsoever to find this case is moot -- or I don't think this Court would want to touch any of the arguments being made here without further briefing, at least as to the new rule. We do think it's absolutely clear we are dealing with point sources. We do think it's absolutely clear, based on the language of -- of 1369(b)(1), that there just can't be any way that there is a jurisdictional, or whatever other kind of problem you want to label it, with us bringing a claim based on the statute itself. The new regulation just simply doesn't fall into those. So if this Court dismisses the case, we'll go to the Ninth Circuit and tell them, we want to go forward for -- for the following reasons. And if anybody is unhappy with what happens in the Ninth Circuit, obviously, we can file or they can file petitions for -- for cert in this Court. Let me just say one last thing to this Court about what we view as really the arbitrary and capricious nature of EPA's new rule and why you shouldn't touch it. Remember, I said -- and this is in EPA's regulations themselves -- that construction activity -­ any construction activity in a site five acres or more is industrial activity. So if a developer buys a parcel of forested land and wants to build a subdivision there and the first thing the developer does is punch in some roads and drainage systems and cut some trees down to make room for the houses, that is covered by the EPA's stormwater rules; but, if a logging company does precisely the same thing, EPA's position seems to be it's not covered. And not only is it not covered if it happens on public land, but I think at least the implication of my friend's position is that, for logging companies, of which there are many in the northwest, that own their own land -- own their own giant pieces of forest land, and that are not open to the public, that are not open to hunters, that are not open to recreation, but they have their own logging roads on their own private lands that nobody can use, but them, I still think his position is that's not covered by the Act. And finally, EPA has one other thing that I want to point out to the Court about this new rule. And it's, again, got our heads -- it gets our heads scratching as to what EPA is really doing here. EPA says twice in the preamble to their new rule, once on page 7 and also on page 12, that it, quote, \"retains the authority to designate at least some logging roads as covered by its so-called point -- Phase II system.\" What the Phase II system is, is under Section 1342(p), which is the stormwater amendments to the Act, it's the category of point source discharges that EPA says are not a covered -- are not industrial activity -- associated industrial activity, but we, nonetheless, are going to require certain things of them. This is the critical point. EPA says this twice. Well, the only authority EPA would have to regulate any logging roads -- discharges from logging roads, is if they are point sources because you don't get into the Phase II program, you don't get into the stormwater amendments, unless you have a point source. If it's a non-point source, then, as my friend has pointed out quite at length in his brief, it's entirely up to the States, and EPA has -- has nothing to say about it.",
  "Right.",
  "I think if that's all we had, Justice Scalia, it might be a little bit ambiguous, although, of course, this is in the context of logging the roads. But look at page 12. And this is the final -- this is the very end of -- of the preamble. The last sentence, \"EPA believes that stormwater discharges from forest roads, including logging roads, should be evaluated under Section 402(p)(6).\" The only authority EPA has for -- for doing that is if they -- if they are point sources; whereas EPA has filed a brief in this case that says that they are, at least some of them, are not. I don't know if it's walking away from that or is planning on walking away from that. But, again, there is a variety of questions, I think, that EPA should have to address and answer -- Did you have one? I'm sorry -- that EPA should have to address and answer before any court does anything based on this new rule.",
  "Well, EPA, of course, is an amicus, Justice Ginsburg, and EPA has an ongoing right to intervene in any citizen suit. That's a statutory right. And there's a statutory notice that any plaintiff in a citizen suit is required to provide to EPA, which we did provide to EPA. And so EPA has every right to intervene in the case at any point as a party.",
  "Well, I think that EPA has a right to intervene and make an argument that the case is moot or any other substantive argument they would like to make back in the Ninth Circuit. And of course, mootness, if it's genuinely moot, which, for all of these reasons, we think, of course, it's not, but mootness is an Article III principle that an amicus could raise, and a court would be bound to consider on its own.",
  "Right.",
  "I think that's what would happen. You could ask them how they would like to proceed, but I assume that's how it would happen, and I assume the defendants in the case would remain the same. So I'm happy to answer any other questions about what the case looks like or what you ought to do, but otherwise, I'll submit it.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fifth Amendment prohibits using a person's silence during a noncustodial police interview against him at trial, and nothing about the specific facts of this case give this Court cause to refrain from applying that rule here. To the contrary, the State's closing argument in this case urging the jury to find Mr. Salinas guilty because, quote, \"an innocent person would have denied law enforcement's accusations,\" strikes at the core of everything the Griffin rule and, indeed, the Fifth Amendment is designed to prohibit. It evokes an inquisitorial system of justice. It effectively shifts the burden of proof onto the defendant, and it demeans individual dignity by conscripting the defendant as a product of his own demise. Now, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals resisted this logic and held the Fifth Amendment didn't apply because there was supposedly no compulsion in this case in the sense that there was no physical or psychological coercion of the kind that's inherent in custody. But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals simply misunderstood the nature of a Griffin claim and the nature of the compulsion. The compulsion that Mr. Salinas faced was when the police asked him the question about ballistics evidence, there was nothing he could do to avoid supplying the State with incriminating evidence that it could use against him. If he answered the question --",
  "No, that's not the holding of the Berghuis case, with all due respect. The Berghuis case was about whether his subsequent statements could be used against him. This Court didn't hold that his silence that preceded those statements could be used against him, and, indeed, that would be contrary to Miranda itself in footnote 37, where the Court said, if somebody stands mute in a custodial setting in the face of law enforcement accusations, they may not be --",
  "If the --",
  "No, I don't need to.",
  "This case is --",
  "Well, it's sufficient to decide this case to say that a noncustodial police interview during the investigation of a crime, where they're interviewing somebody about --",
  "-- who is -- who is, as the State concedes, a suspect in a crime. Now, it may well be that Griffin extends a little bit further, and, remember, the Solicitor General at least agrees that Griffin applies in a noncustodial setting.",
  "I think that would be admissible, but it would be forbidden for the --",
  "Yes. That word would be admissible if the State had -- had any",
  "Perhaps. But the State -- what the State would not be able to do would be to argue that his silence and refusal to answer the question demonstrated his guilt.",
  "I think that may well cross the line. You have the exact issue that arises already in custodial settings, where, under Doyle and footnote 37 of Miranda, you've held that silence can't be used against a criminal defendant. So, Justice Kennedy, you're right, that questions will arise in two ways: One is whether words that the defendant uses are tantamount to refusing to answer the question, and then there is a second question about physical demeanor evidence. The law is already sorted out on this in the lower courts, and I think it's a very workable test. The Solicitor General agrees with what it is, and the reason why this Court hasn't seen a case or -- itself, seen a case like that is because, once the rule is established that the prosecution can't use silence against the defendant, the temptation drops away to try to introduce that evidence for some, supposedly, different purpose.",
  "Insofar as demeanor evidence that the State offers has communicative value and the State argues that it has communicative value, independent of, simply, what the defendant looked like when he remains silent, then it -- then it may well be able to introduce that evidence. Now, as I said, as I was just finishing up telling Justice Kennedy, you're not going to have hard cases in this respect because, once the temptation -- once it's clear that silence can't be used, then the prosecution, I think, has little motivation to try to walk that line. And, indeed, I think it would be appropriate in a case, if the prosecution said, look, the fact that the defendant started crying, we think, is relevant for some reason independent of what he -- of failing to answer the question. The jury could be instructed, as they are in Griffin -- Griffin settings already, that you aren't to consider the defendant's refusal to answer the question against him, but --",
  "No.",
  "No. And I -- and this is where Justice Ginsburg's question came from, so I think it's very important for me to be clear on this. A person in a noncustodial setting still has fewer rights than a person in a custodial setting. What the Court held in Berghuis is that, if the defendant wants to exercise his prophylactic right under Miranda to cut off police questioning -- those are the words this Court used -- that has to be expressly invoked in some manner during the interrogation.",
  "Let me -- if I may, let me focus on the Berghuis question.",
  "And then turn to the selective silence point. The reason why he doesn't have -- Mr. Salinas doesn't have the right that Mr. Berghuis had to cut off questioning. That's the right that has to be expressly invoked, and it, indeed, can only be effectuated in this setting. There was no issue in Berghuis, I don't think, that his silence could be used against him. The State never argued in the Berghuis case that, because he failed to answer for 2 hours, that shows he's guilty. What the State argued in Berghuis was the fact that he later confessed is what shows that he is guilty.",
  "No. You can.",
  "You can. There's two different rights --",
  "Let me separate two rights. One is the prophylactic right under Miranda to have police cease asking you questions. That's one right, and that right has to be expressly invoked in some manner during the interrogation, after you've been warned, in order to effectuate it. There is a separate right, which is the genuine Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. And this Court said, in Miranda itself and it's never questioned since, that that right doesn't have to be expressly invoked.",
  "Right. So, I think, Justice Kennedy --",
  "Right.",
  "He didn't. And so the question -- I think, unless the Court's prepared to hold that even an expressed invocation could be used against him, then it reduces to the question you framed, Justice Kennedy. And so ask yourself whether there's any good reason to require an express invocation in that setting. Mr. Salinas, remember, did expressly invoke his right to -- Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, at trial, in a timely manner, asking for the evidence to be excluded. So the question is whether there's a reason to ask him to do it sooner. And our argument is it's unnecessary, unfair, and a rule like that would be unadministrable. So let me walk through those, if I can. It's unnecessary because all the cases the Solicitor General cites for an express invocation principle involve a scenario where the government has no good reason to know that it's seeking incriminatory information. And, Justice Breyer, this is the limiting principle that you were searching for in the tax cases and the like. If the government doesn't know or have good reason to know that the defendant who is silent is likely to be exercising his right, then the government needs to be put on notice because the government may -- may well challenge that, may well go seek a court order. It may well decide to grant immunity. It may do a number of things. But, here, the government would do absolutely nothing different. Police would have done absolutely nothing different. Indeed, look at the record in this case. What the Solicitor General says is that Mr. Salinas should have said, \"I refuse to answer that question,\" and, if he had said that, everything would be different. But look at what the State argued at trial and what the officer testified. The officer testified, when we asked him that question, he wouldn't answer. The prosecution argued to the jury, he refused to answer that question. So there is no ambiguity in the setting, whether he was remaining silent.",
  "Yeah. I think, as long as the latter part of that test, Justice Breyer -- can be satisfied by exercising the right, that is remaining silent --",
  "-- in a setting in which -- in a setting in which the government has every good reason to know that the person is most likely to be relying on the Fifth Amendment. And, here, where they are investigating a murder and bringing in somebody as a suspect and asking him, basically, did you commit the crime, I think it's a fair assumption -- at least absent any clarification by the police -- remember, when he was silent, the police would have had every right to say, Mr. Salinas, why aren't you answering the question? And so the police could clarify. But, absent any clarification from either the police or the suspect, the more likely than not scenario -- and that's the test the Solicitor General agrees should be used -- the more likely than not conclusion there is that he is exercising the right. Now --",
  "No, Justice Sotomayor, for two reasons: One is, if I understood your hypothetical, it sounded like the defendant may have been on the stand, and that would be an impeachment scenario that's entirely different. But even --",
  "Right. So but -- but even if that were the case, then that would be basically using his statement against him. And so a material omission from a statement is not the same as silence. Here, Mr. Salinas was silent. Now, it's also not just that there's no good reason to require some sort of magic words to be spoken by the suspect, but it's unfair. Remember, the States tell you, in their amicus brief, that, if you affirm in this case and adopt the rule they're asking you for, police officers are going to tell people in its custody, which would be nothing more than an accurate statement of the law, sir, if you are silent in response to any of our questions, the prosecution is going to argue that that -- that shows that you're guilty. They're also going to have every good reason to bring people in. I think this goes a little bit to Justice Kennedy's question and -- and perhaps just yours as well, the fact that Mr. Salinas did agree to commence this interview. Remember, he agreed --",
  "I think you'd have to ask that to the Solicitor General. I don't -- I'm not the one requiring an invocation. And that is part of the administrability problem that the rule raises. I have no idea of all the permutations, one of which you've raised --",
  "-- but you can imagine many more.",
  "It can be introduced. It's hard to understand how that is probative, the fact that he said, I have to leave now, it's time to go.",
  "Yeah.",
  "Well --",
  "Well -- and so -- what the State cannot do is what it did in this case and sort of transform that into he refused to answer, and, therefore, it shows he's guilty. And, if I could go back to the part of the unfairness and the difficulty here, it's not -- it's just that -- yes, Mr. Salinas did come to the police station, but remember why he came to the police station, because they said, we want to bring you in to clear you as a suspect, to get elimination prints. So he was effectively told to come in, so that we can clear you as a suspect, asked perfectly innocuous questions at the beginning of the interview, and then everything shifted on a dime to this one \"gotcha\" question. And I think it's perfectly reasonable and customary in out-of-court settings, where the defendant isn't on the stand and so telling some story, now, trying to backtrack it, but out of court, to be able to selectively exercise your right to silence, when you feel, now, law enforcement is turning against me. And, remember -- this is the other part about, Justice Kennedy, your question. Of course, people know they have a right to remain silent, so why not -- why not ask them to invoke it? Remember, people in this setting generally don't have lawyers. They don't have a right to lawyers. What does the layperson know? The layperson knows, I have a right to remain silent. That's what the layperson knows. The layperson doesn't know I have to say some sort of magic words. And the police, believe me, aren't going to tell him that he does, in order to --",
  "No, I don't think there is a relevant distinction there, Justice Alito, as long as an investigatory interview -- and this Court has said, time and again, whether it's Berkemer in a traffic stop or plenty or Royer, that the police can try to initiate consensual encounters. And the Court has said, time and again, that people don't have to participate in them, and they can cut them off at any time. And it would be odd --",
  "In -- well, if he wants to talk to them --",
  "-- I'm not sure he has the right to remain silent, no.",
  "I think that might, depending on the precision of the hypothetical, be a little bit of a difficult -- different case. But, if the person said, I want to talk to you about criminal activity, started giving statements about a -- about a past crime, so it was an investigatory interview, I think it may well apply.",
  "No, I don't want a gray area opinion. Remember, Justice Kennedy, at least the Solicitor General -- and I'll let the State speak for itself -- but the Solicitor General agrees that Griffin rule applies in a noncustodial setting. I -- I totally understand there's a bright line between custody and noncustody, and so a custodial suspect is in a different situation than a noncustodial suspect. But all I'm saying is, again, in agreement with the Solicitor General, whereas all we disagree on is whether the magic words need to be spoken, that a person who is at least in a police investigatory setting, and so the police would reasonably expect that a failure to seek or answer your question was relying on a Fifth Amendment --",
  "That's precisely what the Court said already in Footnote 37 in Miranda, what the lower courts have depended on for a generation now, and I don't think my opponents are even arguing to the contrary.",
  "Right. Right. Fair enough. I think that's perfectly well-established law. And so the reason is, is there any reason to distinguish for purposes of the Griffin rule -- I understand there's reasons to distinguish in the -- in the settings that Berghuis raises, but, for purposes of the Griffin rule, is there any reason to distinguish between a custodial and a noncustodial setting?",
  "No, but -- but --",
  "No.",
  "No.",
  "Justice Breyer, this is crucial.",
  "If Mr. Salinas had been in a -- if everything about the case was identical, but he'd been in custody, there would be no argument that his silence could be used against him.",
  "But it's not because of the physical or inherent pressures of custody because what the Court has said, time and again, is that, after somebody receives their Miranda warnings, they have a free and deliberate choice whether to talk. And so --",
  "Well, no, but I do want -- I do want to make sure that the Court understands the critical difference between the express invocation requirement that this Court established in Berghuis and what I'm asking for today. And the express invocation requirement in Berghuis is the -- is -- is to administer the Miranda prophylactic rule, that the police have to stop asking somebody questions when they invoke their rights, the rights they've just been advised of, remember. It didn't hold in Berghuis and it -- and it's never held that, if somebody is Mirandized -- and let's say Mr. Berghuis was Mirandized and just remained silent for two hours, and then the police said to themselves, oh, this guy is never going to talk, we end the interview, there would have been no argument the State could have made in that case, that his silence could be used against him. And so I understand that -- that -- you know, I'm -- that custody is different, but, in terms of the express invocation requirement, there's no express invocation requirement in custody, and there's no reason for it here.",
  "I understand, but his silence wasn't able to be used against him in Berghuis; his state -- his later statements were. And so, yes, you could have a scenario --",
  "Pardon?",
  "Exactly.",
  "Precisely.",
  "That's exactly my point. And remember, again, the layperson in this setting who knows -- if there's one thing the layperson knows and most every American knows, is that they have a right to remain silent. So somebody nervous in this setting, without a lawyer, the one sanctuary they have is simply not to talk. If you issue an opinion that says, as the Solicitor General would like, you have to pronounce some sort of magic words, it's terribly unfair and terribly misleading and, again, for no good reason. And it raises all kinds of administrability problems. The Court is going to have an absolute, I think, flood of cases of all the permutations of somebody under different kind of police warnings or the other that may be given ahead of time and different kind of verbal formulations. Maybe he says, I'd like to talk about something else. Maybe he says, as the Chief Justice explained, I'm going to leave now. Maybe he actually just doesn't show up for the interview. There is innumerable permutations. The easy rule --",
  "No.",
  "So as to where -- as to where you draw the line, if I understand your question, as to where an express invocation before trial would be required, you are going to have to draw a line. I think it's very easy to draw the line and just say a police investigatory interview because that's the setting where the police have every reason to believe that silence is an exercise of the right. All the other settings, whether they be tax settings, whether they be immigration cases, all the totally disparate settings the Solicitor General cites cases involving, it's perfectly reasonable to require an advance invocation there. But, remember, the Court said in Chavez that the Fifth Amendment is a trial right, and so invoking it at trial is perfectly timely in the ordinary setting. The only question is whether you should have some sort of special requirement for special reason. We think there is no good reason, and it would be very unfair. I'd like to --",
  "Thank you. I'd like to make three points. First, Justice Breyer, your question about the state of the law, with respect to question number 432, In our reply brief, at page 4, we cite cases that are all Fifth Amendment cases, and Canterbury, also, which is a Tenth Circuit case cited elsewhere in our brief, uniformly holding that the Fifth Amendment applies. The Solicitor General, when they speak about a circuit split with relation to Doyle, they're talking about impeachment cases. Remember, Doyle and Jenkins, which are the cases the State cited to you in response to your question are impeachment cases that are entirely different. Second, if I -- we can look at the transcript this afternoon, but I believe both the State and the Solicitor General said to you, today, if Mr. Salinas would have said, I don't want to answer that question, then he would win, then Griffin would apply. But, because it was somehow ambiguous, that it shouldn't, that is ridiculous. If you look at the transcript in this case, what did the officer testify when he said -- he asked him the question, he said he did not answer. What did the prosecutor argue to the jury in closing? Verbatim of what the State is telling you today is all Mr. Salinas had to say. At closing, the State said, the police officer testified that he wouldn't answer that question. He didn't want to answer that. So the whole principle behind express invocation jurisprudence is to put the State and the police on fair notice that somebody is exercising the right to remain silent. There was zero ambiguity in this case that was going on. So it explains why the rule that the State and the Solicitor General have fallen back on in court today is formalism of the absolute worst kind, and the only thing that this formal requirement of saying some sort of magic words -- and I agree with Justice Kagan, I don't know what they are -- but whatever they are, what -- exactly what the State argued to the jury apparently would have been enough, is just nothing more than a trap for the unwary, who is told, through culture and learning, that he has a right to remain silent. And he does the one thing that is consistent with his right, which is exercising it, and, somehow, the State is telling you that it can walk into court and say, because he remains silent, he's guilty of a crime; jury, you should conclude he's guilty of a crime. And, Justice Sotomayor, when you asked the State, well, what about an officer that tells the defendant, as he will have every incentive to do, in South Carolina v. Neville, in a roughly comparable situation, that law enforcement actually admitted they were already doing it, but the States tell you they'll do it here, when the officer says, if you don't answer, we're going to use that against you, the State said that would be coercion. But the officer would be doing nothing more than stating the rule the Court is asking you to announce today. So wouldn't the defendant know the law? Don't we assume that the suspect knows the law? And the State's telling you, well, if the officer tells the person what the law is, it's coercion. So, really, what we're asking today is nothing radical. It's nothing of a departure of our deepest traditions, which require the government to shoulder the load itself, to prove the case itself, and not to enlist the defendant as an instrument in his own demise. People's silence -- it is the time-honored concept of the Fifth Amendment, which, remember, was created for out-of-court questioning by law enforcement authorities, that people who remain silent could not have that used against them at trial. And, finally, I hope the -- the confusion with respect to the Berghuis, as related to this case, has been dispelled. I think Justice Kagan got it exactly right. But, remember, another way to make it clear is that, if Mr. Salinas had said, in response to the question, I'd like for you to stop asking me questions, the police wouldn't have had to honor that. Somebody not in custody doesn't have a right to have questioning cut off, so the police could have kept asking him questions. That's the only right that a custodial suspect has and needs to expressly invoke. The right to remain silent is not something that's ever had to be expressly invoked by somebody in custody or not in custody, and there's no good reason to require it to be invoked here. If the Court has any further questions, I'd be happy to entertain them. Otherwise, I'll submit the case.",
  "No, that would be --",
  "That would be an entirely different case. And we wouldn't have a problem with the State making legitimate arguments based on demeanor evidence that is, itself, communicative, as opposed to what it did in this case, which is argue that his silence demonstrated his guilt.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The doctrine of third­party consent is best understood as establishing a rebuttable presumption. When the police arrive at a house at which multiple people live, they can assume, according to social custom, that if one person grants consent to enter, that person is speaking for everybody who lives in the dwelling. But when somebody is present and tells the police officer that he refuses consent, that presumption is reversed. Then when the police full well know that one person doesn't have a delegated authority to speak for the others, they must respect the objection. And a failure to do so violates the Fourth Amendment. In other words, Matlock already gives the police all of the benefit of the doubt. Even when people are nearby and have a ­­ might have an interest in objecting, the police can assume, as this put ­­ as this Court put it in Randolph, that asking that other person wouldn't make a difference very often, and therefore, they can presume that they would also consent to the search. So all we're ­­",
  "She can invite them in, Justice Breyer, and the police, within about 15 minutes, can get a warrant and come right in and ­­",
  "Pardon me?",
  "On the basis that I think that you've just described that she said there's essentially ­­",
  "Okay.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, I've never seen a case like that, but there'd be two things I would say if one arose. One is, under Coolidge ­­ under the Coolidge case, she could simply go get the things in the closet and give it to the police officer. And that would take care of the problem, as Justice Thomas pointed out in his separate opinion in Randolph. In addition, she may well be able to invite the police into the dwelling sometimes, but that's very different than what's going on here.",
  "Well, no, I'm sorry. Then I misunderstood. In that case, it would violate the Fourth Amendment for the police to come in. But I think the hypotheticals that one might think of and that can arise, as certainly the other side pointed out in the brief, leave out three very important things that I think you need to ask under the Fourth Amendment social customs analysis. The first is you need to remember that we're asking about whether a stranger ­­ because the police officer can step into the shoes of what a stranger would be allowed to do ­­ whether a stranger would feel like that was acceptable reason to come into the house, not just because they'd been invited by the wife but vis­à­vis what the objector had said. And it's very different when you ask about a stranger as opposed to what the other side would like to say, a neighbor or ­­",
  "Because I think ­­ that was just the point I was trying to make, Justice Alito. A friend is different than a police officer. Remember what the objection said in this case. It said, you can't come in. And he said, I know my rights. And so, translated as best we can translate that kind of a statement to the social setting that we're supposed to translate it to, it's saying ­­",
  "I think it's still very ­­",
  "I think it's very different ­­",
  "No. I think the police can stand into the shoes, as this Court put it in Jardines, Justice Kennedy, of a stranger. They are not a friend. They are able ­­ they are able to do what a stranger caller could do at the house, and that's a very different question than what a friend might do. And there's two other things that I think are critical ­­",
  "That's the ordinary presumption, but what this Court held ­­",
  "It may be a property right, but it's trumped by the constitutional right of another resident of the dwelling to forbid the police for entering without a warrant. That's the holding in Randolph. And I understand that there's a debate on that.",
  "Well, because it's this Court's precedent and no one on the other side is asking to have it overturned.",
  "Well, I think, Justice Scalia, that's a fair way to put the question here, which is once somebody does exactly what this Court said they had a right to do in Randolph, which is say, you cannot come in my house, what happens next? And our proposal in this case is that the police cannot nullify that objection simply by involuntarily removing the person from the premises.",
  "Well, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, if I could fairly characterize the case, there is physical presence in this case. Mr. Randolph ­­ I'm sorry. Mr. Fernandez was physically present and enforced ­­ invoked his Randolph rights. So the question is what happens next? And my ­­",
  "Well, two things, Justice Kennedy. All we are saying is that the objection for Randolph has to last as long as the police make it impossible for somebody to enforce it. So once they remove you and make it impossible for you even to camp on doorstep, which is what the other side would require, at a bare minimum, if Randolph means anything, it has to mean that. To answer your hypothetical directly, the police can simply get a warrant. If you look at the lower court cases, they all arise immediately after an arrest, which is why ­­",
  "If she wants that, she has numerous ways to help the police, Justice Kennedy. It's hard for me to think of many examples, just to be fair, where by providing oral information about what she might be worried about, what she might think is in the house, in combination with the fact that the defendant has already been arrested, that would not provide probable cause. As I've said, I have not seen such a case that has ever actually arisen.",
  "No. Of course not.",
  "No. I'm simply answering ­­ I think what I'm trying to do is answer the practical question that Justice Breyer and Justice Kennedy have raised about what if the police can't come in under the really fallacious theory that she's consenting not only on her behalf ­­",
  "Remember, there are two people that have rights in that scenario, her and the defendant ­­ or the suspect. And what the Constitution says is that searches of homes presumably have to be done under warrant. Now, if somebody consents and the police have no reason to doubt that that consent speaks not only for the person standing in front of them but also for an absent person, they can enter, and that's what happens most of the time. But in the rare occasion where somebody says, I invoke my rights, I want to insist upon the warrant requirement, the police ought to do that. I don't think it's too much to ask.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, the police can do that and presumably, no matter what you hold in this case, they will continue to do that. And in the vast majority of cases, they will continue to get valid consent. The only question you have in this case is what about the rare circumstance where somebody invokes his rights. In Randolph there ­­ I understand what you said in King, but in Randolph the Court specifically referred to the Fourth Amendment's partiality towards searches of the home conducted pursuant to a warrant.",
  "Let me try to walk you through it, because I think it is vital here. The answer to your question, Justice Breyer, is the holding of Randolph says when the other tenant objects, then the police cannot come in. And so I think the question that you need to ask in this case for social expectations purposes and it's critical that it's framed the right way, and I do want to point out the three things I was mentioning earlier. You have to ask whether a stranger, under these circumstances, would feel like he had consent, not just from the person standing in front of him but on behalf of the others, to conduct a general search of the dwelling. Even if you think that somebody coming back would think they could be invited in because the objector is no longer gone, that is leagues away from what the police asked to do here and what they are general search of the premises. And on page 7 of the reply brief, we point out again and again how this Court has distinguished between mere entry and search. And the third thing ­­",
  "If I could just put it on the table, and then I'll answer your question. The third thing that's critical is what I mentioned a moment earlier, the nature of the objection here. The nature of the objection isn't simply you can't come in. It isn't I'm busy. You can come back later. It is I ­­ I know my rights. And I think translated into a social setting with a stranger, that means I have private things in here that I do not want you to see. And would somebody coming back an hour later think that over that kind of an objection, they could get consent from the other person to search through the belongings, I think that's the question you have to ask.",
  "About pretext?",
  "In all fairness, I don't know that it does. It certainly doesn't help me on the facts of this case, because we're not establishing any bad ­­ or not alleging any bad faith. I think the government and the State have both pointed out, quite rightly, that this Court has shunned pretext inquiries throughout the Fourth Amendment, and so I'm not sure that you want to go down that road here. But, Justice Sotomayor, that points out a very big problem. Their rule is a recipe for the evisceration of Randolph because as soon as ­­",
  "All you have to do is arrest and remove them, and that's the facts of this case. But even if you didn't have the authority to arrest and remove them, the police always have the authority to exert control over the situation when they arrive at a dwelling and to say to a homeowner, sir, would you please come out to the curb and talk to me here, and I'm going to separate you from the other tenant. Under their theory, even that ordinary, boring part of police procedure extinguishes somebody's Randolph rights immediately. And so their rule simply gives the police total control, whether for good faith or for bad faith ­­ and I don't think you're going to want to have to try to answer that question ­­ to immediately extinguish someone's Randolph's rights the moment they're invoked.",
  "I think I'd agree with what you're saying, Justice Ginsburg. If somebody is convicted of a crime and then imprisoned, I think they lose their equal ownership over the dwelling that is a lynchpin ­­",
  "I'm not sure that a charge would be enough to take ­­ take one out of the social setting where one would assume that somebody's objections still stood.",
  "Justice Kennedy, at least until he's convicted, I don't think he does. Now, you don't have to go ­­ if that really is what's troubling you, let me tell you something that I think you can decide the case on a more narrow ground. It's enough to decide this case, and indeed, the vast majority of lower court cases, to say so long as the police make it impossible for somebody to enforce the Randolph objection, either by being at their home to protect it on their own, or at least to have a conversation with the cotenant to try to work it out amongst themselves, which is, remember, exactly what Randolph says, is that voluntary accommodation has to be the solution. So at least with ­­ you know, at least in a case like this where there's an hour and somebody's gone, the police return right away, it is virtually impossible. I think there their objection has to stand. After 500 days, if you really wanted to at least leave it open for another case, you could say there we could imagine that he could have a conversation with the cotenant, try to work out the solution to the problem, and that she could speak for him solely to the police at that point ­­",
  "Well, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, in that situation, the police would probably do well to do exactly what they did here, which is remove him from the premises, arrest him, and then all they, again, have to do is get a warrant. In Los Angeles County, it takes them 15 minutes on average to get a telephonic warrant. And under Illinois ­­",
  "Well, I think to be fair, in this Court's cases, they've ­­ sometimes you've said ­­ and we've quoted those other cases in the reply brief ­­ that the administrative efficiency is not a good enough reason to dispense with the warrant requirement. I think every one of these cases is context­specific, and the one thing that the Fourth Amendment has, I think, meant in this Court is that the home is special, and that when the police want to enter a home ­­ Florida against Jardines last term, I think, also fairly said that we prefer warrants. I think Jardines is actually a very useful case to think about in thinking about the social expectation problem here, because the very same kind of hypotheticals that ­­ some of which I've received today and the other side is raising about a neighbor or a friend coming back, those were the government's exact arguments in Jardines, that somebody can come to the front door and knock and ask if anybody's there. And so why can't a police officer do the same? And this Court was careful at page 1417 of that decision to say that's not the question. The question is whether a stranger can come onto the premises with trained dogs to explore the curtilage of somebody's house. And that's a very odd question to ask, I think, because very few strangers are going to do that. But that's the question this Court insisted on asking. And I think translated to this case a version, the same kind of question is what the Court has to do here, is ask a stranger, after being told, I invoke my rights. I want to keep what's inside private from you. I don't consent to any search, whether a stranger coming back an hour later would think that when they asked the other tenant can I come inside and search, that that tenant ­­",
  "Which ­­",
  "I don't know that it was any more than Randolph. I mean, what the Court has said is that property rights inform the Fourth Amendment analysis. They don't utterly control it, but that the sanctity of the home is something the Fourth Amendment treats as special. And I think the property right that Mr. Fernandez had here was ­­ which is undiminished by his arrest, and the other side hasn't disputed that it ­­ hasn't disputed this, is that he had a property right to keep the police out of his dwelling absent a warrant. And all we're asking is for that right to be preserved, at least so long as the police themselves render it impossible for him to enforce that right. Literally impossible for him to enforce that right. The other side's theory, even taking away the police arrest, I think if I understand it correctly, would require somebody to basically pitch a tent on their front steps in order to ­­ to prevent the police from entering without a warrant.",
  "Well, fair enough, Justice Kennedy. But at the time the search was made, it was only an hour later while the police had custody over him before any of that happened.",
  "No, I don't think there's any testimony to that effect, Justice Ginsburg. And so what we're left with is the State's brief, which has primarily the administrative efficiency argument that Mr. Chief Justice has made. I understand in ­­ in Maryland against King, this Court took that in consideration, but I think in numerous other Fourth Amendment cases, the Court has said that's not enough.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, in those other permutations, you have, first of all, the exigent circumstances doctrine. But even short of that, you have Illinois versus McArthur, which allows the police to have everybody exit a dwelling and stabilize the situation until they can get a warrant.",
  "No, I don't think so. I was just ­­ in your hypothetical, there might have been if I understood it correctly, but ­­",
  "No, Justice Breyer, I understand that's ­­ that's a concern, but there are two very easy ways for the police to deal with that. One is Coolidge. They can say ­­ you can say: Go get the things you're worried about and bring them to us, and the problem is solved. Alternatively, the police can say: Thanks for telling us. I'm glad you did. I want to help you. Your husband has objected or your boyfriend has objected to us searching. Could you please step outside for 15 minutes, you and the little boy step outside for 15 minutes, we'll call a judge and get an official warrant and we'll be inside in 15 minutes. Meanwhile, we'll protect you. I don't think that's too much to ask to preserve the privacy and the sanctity of the home. If the Court doesn't have any other questions, I think I'll stop here and reserve for rebuttal.",
  "Well, Your Honor ­­",
  "Thank you. I'd ­­ I think I'd like to use as my jumping off point Justice Breyer's last question where he went through, I believe, the elements in his concurrence. They're all present in this case. And ­­ and as to the test, the reasonableness test, if you have any qualms about that being the test, you can do the case even more narrowly and it would take care, again, of the vast majority of cases that have arisen post Randolph, and simply say the objection has to be valid so long as it's impossible for him to enforce it. So long as it's impossible for him to be physically present and enforcing it, through no voluntary action of his own, at least then the objection has to be valid. And the lockbox example the other side gives, even that isn't available to Mr. Fernandez. Once he objected and knew the police were interested in his dwelling, he didn't have an opportunity even to do that. If he had private papers ­­ remember, we have to think of all different kinds of cases that might arise for ­­ where the police were seeking consent. He couldn't even take that ­­",
  "No, because ­­",
  "No, Justice Kennedy, because if he's a law­abiding citizen, the police couldn't take him away and he could stay there or, at a minimum, the police might be able to reposition him as I think they've acknowledged that occurred ­­",
  "No, I ­­ but to be intellectually coherent you might say, no, even then the police couldn't override it. I don't think there's any reason to believe that the police could then think ­­ if somebody said, I object to you entering the dwelling and doing ­­ doing a ­­ a general search. Now, I have a business trip next week for three days. I want you to let ­­ you know, I still object and do not want any warrantless general searches of my home. I think there, the police would have a hard time arguing that they had valid third­party consent from the person in the dwelling.",
  "No, because I think once he's imprisoned, you might say he has a new domicile, Justice Breyer.",
  "I think he's lost ownership control over that house. But I think what this case reduces to, Justice Kennedy, to get back to your question, is really what respect is owed this Court's Randolph decision. I think the questions have adequately pointed out that if you adopt the other side's position on the facts of this case where the police forcibly remove somebody to the dwelling, Randolph reduces to nothing. Literally nothing. It's also about what respect is owed to somebody invoking somebody's constitutional rights. In another case last term, this ­­ a plurality of this Court went to lengths to explain how important it is that people invoke their constitutional rights. And, presumably, when they do, the police need to respect it. We live in a constitutional system that deals with individual dignity, not just of homeowners, but of people who enforce ­­ who ­­ who raise their rights and they need to be respected. Now, you have left these ­­ you know, if there were insuperable practical problems to enforcing Randolph in this setting, maybe you would want to reduce it to nothing and effectively overrule it. But I don't think there's any good reason to do that because I think you have a very easy rule that will resolve almost all the cases that I've offered you, and it will deal with ­­ by exigent circumstances doctrine, by the warrant ­­ ease of getting a warrant, by Illinois v. McArthur, which lets the police bring somebody outside, all of those things can very easily deal, I think, with the concerns that the Court has before it.",
  "No, I think when Randolph said it was being formalistic, it didn't mean we're establishing a meaningless right. And so, yes, the facts of that case where somebody who's physically present, the facts of this case begin with somebody who's physically present, and I think this Court ought to treat its opinion as having some genuine meaning in the real world that you're not ­­",
  "Two things, Justice Alito. First, that's not the facts of this case. Remember, they come back earlier solely looking for evidence ­­",
  "It would. And there, I think, it is not too much disrespectful to say to her, I'd like to help you, we will help you. Your boyfriend has objected. Let us just get a warrant and we'll be right with you and we'll help you. I don't think that's too disrespectful. It respects her rights and the constitutional system under which we live.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves applying the core protection of the Fourth Amendment to a new factual circumstance. It has always been the case that an occasion of an arrest did not give the police officers authority to search through the private papers and the drawers and bureaus and cabinets of somebody's house, and that protection should not evaporate more than 200 years after the founding because we have the technological development of smartphones that have resulted in people carrying that information in their pockets.",
  "Well, what this Court said in Robinson at Page 235 is the reason supporting the authority for a search incident to arrest are the two Chimel factors, which are gathering evidence to prevent its destruction, and officer's safety. Now ­­",
  "Yes, of course that's done every day. Once the gun is in the police ­­ the police department's lawful possession, I think Edwards says that they can do all that.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, the Court has never described that as one of the things. If you want to think about this case the way you thought about the automobile search in Gant, it would be a beginning premise; but I think you're right, that even if that were a beginning premise, it would be only that, a beginning. In Footnote 9 in Edwards, this Court said that any search incident to arrest still has to satisfy the Fourth Amendment's general ­­ general reasonableness.",
  "Right.",
  "Right. And there's important things to understand if you want to start thinking about Gant, because both in terms of its history and its modern application, it's dramatically different from what we have here.",
  "No, Your Honor. What Weeks said, you quoted it, fruits and instrumentalities of the crime have always been something that could be seized from a person. Now, Weeks, of course, as this Court said in Robinson itself, was dicta. And there was that historical authority to take fruits and evidence ­­ I'm sorry ­­ fruits and instrumentalities of the crime.",
  "Weeks used ­­",
  "Weeks uses the word \"evidence,\" but, Justice Scalia, because it was not at issue in that case, the ­­ the Bishop treatise that you cited in your Thornton concurrence talks about tools and instrumentalities. Now, I don't think we have to debate that here, because even if we're in a world where the police can seize some evidence and keep it and use it for the prosecution simply for that reason, even if they don't fear destruction, there are still very, very profound problems with searching a smartphone without a warrant, because even under the Robinson rule, this Court has recognized, for example, when it comes to blood draws, search ­­ something like a strip search that might occur at the scene, there are limits even to the Robinson rule. So it brings us ­­",
  "No. That's the rule of Robinson, that any physical item on an arrestee can be seized and inspected and then used as evidence if it's useful evidence. We draw a line. ­­",
  "The difference is digital information versus physical items. Physical items at the scene can pose a safety threat and have destruction possibilities that aren't present with digital evidence. What is more, once you get into the digital world, you have the framers' concern of general warrants and the ­­ the writs of assistance.",
  "Well, let me take those one thing at a time. I take it the theory of Robinson, this is the theory the government itself propounded, is that any physical item, because it contained a razor blade or a pin or anything, needs to be inspected to be sure. And so you have a categorical rule because of the ad hoc nature of arrests that police don't have to distinguish physical items one from the other.",
  "I think they can, if nothing else, under plain view once it's in their hand, Justice Kennedy. But I really don't want to fight ­­",
  "I think that is fine under the categorical rule. I think what you have in Robinson is a categorical rule that obviates these exact difficult case­by­case determinations. You can make an argument, and if I needed to, if it were a diary case or a billfold case, you might be able to make an argument, but I think the Court wisely decided under Robinson that we need a categorical rule that's easily administrable in the field. Now, when you have digital evidence, the categorical rule, we submit, cuts exactly in the opposite direction. Because digital information ­­ even the notion of flipping through photos in a smartphone implicates vast amounts of information, not just the photos themselves, but the GPS locational data that's linked in with it, all kinds of other information that is intrinsically intertwined in smartphones.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice ­­",
  "I think that would be extraordinarily difficult to administer that rule. And let me tell you why. Because most of the information on smartphones is private. Much of it is just, like the photos in this case, just kept on somebody's phone and not shared with anybody. Even a Facebook account is a limited universe of people who have access to it. You're right that ­­",
  "I think it's fair to say you have a sliding scale and there's some stuff on a phone that might be posted on the Internet, for example. The difficulty with that case, if you wanted to address it in a future case, would be the intertwined nature of information on a phone. So looking at those photos in a smartphone account will be linked to the contacts inside the phone; it will be linked to GPS information inside the phone. All of this information is intertwined and I think you'd have a difficult administrability problem if you wanted to create some sort of rule like that. Now, remember, the government might try to deal with that problem differently by saying information in the cloud, so to speak, is not accessible to officers. We submit that just further would compound the difficulty of applying a rule in this circumstance.",
  "Well, the way you've phrased the question, I think that's what ­­ that's the first cut at this, is looking at the particular pieces of evidence here, which are photos and videos. But we don't think you can write an opinion that would distinguish those from anything else on a ­­ almost anything else on a smartphone. I mean, the State's argument here is that those are not, quote, \"fundamentally different\" from other things that people would carry around.",
  "In all likelihood, yes, Justice Kennedy.",
  "And they had plenty of time to do so.",
  "Well, let me say a couple important things about the warrant requirement and then return to Justice Alito's question. This Court has said time and again that the mere fact the police could have gotten a warrant but didn't does not excuse a Fourth Amendment violation. Let me say a couple things about the warrant requirement and then return to Justice Alito.",
  "With a warrant, Justice Kennedy. And let me talk about why a warrant is so important. First of all, it interposes a neutral observer in between the citizen and the police officer. Perhaps more importantly, it does two very big things. One is it can trigger the Fourth Amendment's particularity requirement so that the magistrate can say: This is what you can look at and what didn't. Remember, in this case the prosecution ultimately introduced photos and videos, but that's not what the detective testified to at trial as to the scope of his search. He said, at JA­11, we looked at a whole lot of stuff on the phone and that's just what, in his words, \"caught his eye.\"",
  "We give an example of a warrant in the footnote in our reply brief. I believe it's footnote 3, Justice Ginsburg. And there are many more available on the web from States that already require warrants. What they do is they say ­­ the police officer testifies, perhaps somewhat like he testified here at the suppression hearing, I suspected this fellow was in a gang and ­­ and I believe gang members keep certain kinds of things on their phone, this is the kind of crime that we're investigating, and therefore these particular files within the phone are likely to obtain evidence. And then what happens is the warrants say with particularity: Here's the things you can look at; here's what you can't. More importantly, Justice Ginsburg, a warrant requirement ­­",
  "I think much easier for a magistrate at some remove than an officer under the ­­ under the stresses in the field. Now, Justice Scalia ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "I would say his banking app, his online dating app ­­",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, those arguments can be made on an app­by­app basis. But what happens is ­­ this is the benefit of our rule as opposed to the government's. What the government says is let the officer look and then have a back­end hearing where you just suppress all the stuff that he wasn't supposed to look at once you apply particularity requirements. Under our rule, once the officer has the warrant, Leon kicks in and so you don't have to have all these hearings in district courts, because once an officer does a proper search according to the corners of a warrant, you don't have to have the kind of suppression hearing. And there's one other very important thing that goes into a warrant which might have been glossed over too quickly in the briefs. It's not just what can be looked at; it's how it can be kept. The retention of information raises extraordinary Fourth Amendment concerns. My understanding in California is, at least for some crimes, it's not just that they're downloading the information and looking at it for the crime of arrest, but they're keeping this information in databases, ever­growing databases of every cell phone that they've ever seized.",
  "I think probably not. And I think this is the way the categorical rule in Robinson, where it sweeps in the kind of hypotheticals we were talking about in one direction. I think a categorical rule in the other direction for digital information would sweep in the Fitbit. I mean, obviously, I don't have to win that argument today, but I think that's how you would approach that question. Remember, the Fitbit ­­ and this is true even more so of smartphones ­­ tells you just the kind of information the Court was very concerned about in Kyllo. It tells you ­­ modern smartphones work the inside of people's house. They work the appliances and ­­ and they have cameras. They also monitor the inside of people's bodies.",
  "Well, I think you may want to ­­ that will be part of your conversation in the next case perhaps. I think the easiest way to decide the case right now in 2014 is simply say: Digital evidence kept on modern cell phones are different than physical items. I don't think it's really worth going back in time to the most rudimentary device and having that argument.",
  "I think that might be the same kind of case as you have now. Remember, the ­­ the phone in this case had a removable memory card, as many still do, which by the way we were going to talk about the destruction of evidence. That's one answer to the destruction of evidence problem. It couldn't possibly have arisen with respect to the evidence at issue because it was on a removable memory card that couldn't be erased remotely or password protected. Now, we've given lots of arguments in the brief that explain why the government's arguments as to wiping simply don't stand up. And ­­",
  "No.",
  "Right. So I take it that the ordinary rule is if the police lawfully seize evidence in the physical world, if it's a ­­ if it's a physical item, it might at some point have to be returned to the owner of it. But if it's something that can be made a photocopy of or a photo, it remains in police files as lawfully obtained information they can use indefinitely into the future. You have real problems, however, when you apply that typical rule to digital information, because now ­­ again, what I understand ­­ and the government itself ­­ the Federal Government in Footnote 3 of its reply brief in Wurie acknowledges that it's keeping in an ever­growing Federal database at least some of the information seized from smartphones.",
  "I'm sorry. Maybe I didn't understand it.",
  "Oh. No. Well, not necessarily, because the beauty of a search warrant is it can delineate retention rules. It can say here's ­­ here's how long you're allowed to keep the information, here's who's allowed to look at it and who's not. And it can ­­",
  "Well, I think that, Justice Sotomayor, that is what is starting to now happen in the digital world, because we just have new and different concerns that had arisen ­­ than had arisen in the past.",
  "Absolutely. There ­­ there would be times at the scene where exigencies would allow it. First of all, the two officer safety arguments the other side makes about a hypothetical bomb or a confederate ambush, as this Court already recognized in Chadwick, would give exigent circumstances. The concern about remote wiping we think, and as the experts have described in the amicus brief filed by EPIC and many others, we don't think would ever arise ­­ give rise to a situation where that was a legitimate concern, but in a very odd world, yes.",
  "Well, I think surrounding facts and circumstances ­­ in Footnote 9 in Chadwick, what the Court said, dealing with a locked briefcase where you'd have the same problem, Justice Scalia, surrounding facts and circumstances might indicate. There's a hypothetical, I believe it's on page 1 of the amicus brief filed by the State investigative agencies, that I think gives a classic textbook example of how exigent circumstances might apply.",
  "No. I ­­",
  "I think you're right that that's going to be an extraordinarily rare circumstance. All I'm saying is if you had that extraordinarily rare circumstance, you would not need to get a warrant.",
  "Justice Kennedy, we looked high and low as well ­­",
  "­­ and did not find cases involving briefcases full of documents. And there's only one or two stray mentions of a diary. Judge Friendly also mentions the diary situation.",
  "Yes.",
  "I don't want to tread on both lawyers in that case, but certainly in my case, we have an exploratory search where not even the State has contended the amount of information looked at is equivalent to what somebody could have carried around in the old days. Can I say something?",
  "Okay.",
  "There are cases on that, Mr. Chief Justice. Obviously, this Court hasn't addressed them. All the cases we've found are cases where the police already had a warrant in hand and they've been held that, yes, the police officers can answer the phone in that circumstance. Unquestionably, the police officers could look at the screen.",
  "For somebody's arrest.",
  "No, I'm sorry, Mr. Justice Scalia. I think also in ­­ to ­­ to effectuate an arrest and ­­ and an immediate search of the area. Now, certainly you could look at the caller ID coming through because that would be in plain view. But if I can return to Justice Kennedy's question about the diary. Because there's a couple of important aspects to that I hope to be able to draw out. The reason I think that you don't find diary cases when you look for them is because people hardly ever carry a diary outside the home with them. It was kept in a private drawer in the bedroom or wherever it might be kept, and in the highly, highly unusual circumstance where somebody did, you might have a hard case. This is an ­­ this is the opposite world. The modern reality of smartphones is that it is an indispensable item for everyday life of a modern professional and, indeed, most anyone. You can't leave the house without it and be ­­ consider yourself to be responsible and safe. And so you take ­­ to take a world where the police might try to say, we can get the stray diary because of the importance of the categorical rule under Robinson and try to apply that into a world where everybody has everything with them at all times ­­",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, the Fourth Amendment has ­­ has a balance already built in in that respect. We're not saying they can't look at digital information. We're just saying that when they seize it, they can freeze the contents and then go get a warrant and search what they're allowed to search and keep it under the rules of that warrant.",
  "No, I don't think either side ­­",
  "If the other side were making an argument that this wasn't even a search, then I think that might be an argument they would deploy. But I think, and I don't want to speak for the government, but I think that they also agree that password protection doesn't matter. And it certainly doesn't matter under their argument as to what information they get. I mean, their position is if we seize a corporate executive's smartphone at the scene that is locked and protected under password, if we can get that information out back at our lab, we get it all and we don't have to ask for a warrant and we can keep it as long as we want.",
  "No, I don't think so. People don't lock their homes, they don't lock their briefcases. Simply having it inside the smartphone protected on the person is enough to trigger the Fourth Amendment, and I think to sustain the arguments I've advanced. If I could reserve the rest of my time.",
  "Thank you. I think I heard about four or five different proposed rules that I want to just go through, each of them, one at a time. First, the State talked about a, quote, \"fundamentally different rule,\" and I think Justices have already figured out what we say at page 17­18 of our reply brief, which is that would sweep in virtually everything on the phone. To the extent it wouldn't, you'd have a really difficult struggle on a case­by­case basis to answer the very difficult question whether any particular app had fundamentally different information that existed in the nondigital world. I also heard a suggestion, that, well, if a laptop or a smartphone is on somebody's person, that's different than if it's sitting next to them. That's not correct if what the government says about its Chimel ­­ about passwords and wiping satisfies Chimel. Remember, Chimel gives authority to search and seize without a warrant anything in the grab area if there's a destruction argument. So the person who's arrested sitting at his desk at the office, in reaching area from his computer would be open to a full search under the government's rule. There was also discussion about the exigencies at the scene of an arrest, needing to prevent a remote wipe, preventing a password from kicking in. The first thing to make sure you understand is those arguments can apply only at the scene. They don't apply in this case, where an officer takes the phone back to the police station and 2 hours later searches through it as his ­­ at his leisure. So all the arguments about at the scene and what the officer needs to be able to do at the scene can be left for another case. And I think Justice Breyer is exactly right. At the very best what the government has shown is that there may be certain tightly limited circumstances where exigent circumstances would apply. And I want to say a just quick thing on the password question in particular, which we didn't talk about but may come up in the next argument. Pages 12 to 14 of our reply brief, we outline how highly unusual as a factual matter it would be for a smartphone to be seized while it's still unlocked and for an officer not to be able to address concern at the scene that it might lock later. And it's also worth noting that in a footnote we attach, the government is arguing in lower courts that even if it does lock, that the Fifth Amendment does not give the person the opportunity to refuse to divulge the password in ­­ in response to a warrant. So the password argument doesn't have any play if the government wins the argument its making in the lower courts. Justice Kennedy, you suggested the possibility of distinguishing between serious and nonserious offenses. I think, with all due respect, this Court's decisions in Robinson and Atwater, where that issues was squarely presented, preclude that kind of a ­­ a determination for all the reasons the government argued in those cases. And then finally, Justice Scalia, you, I think, had mentioned a couple times the Gant principle as applied to this case, evidence that you think you might find on a phone. Well, there's two profound problems with that. The first is, as the Court recognized in Kyllo, you need to be sure to protect the amount of privacy people had at the founding. And as I said in my opening, the fact that somebody might incidentally have an item on his person, even in the rare case, diary or address book, are leagues away from the kind of information people have now that were stored in the home and that were sacrosanct at an arrest, and that's what the thread throughout history says is an arrest cannot be an occasion to do that kind of a search. And, Justice Kagan, you're exactly right. If you run the Gant test through the world of crimes, the government might be able to identify a crime here or there that would be difficult to make an argument about. But lots of minor crimes, like speeding, as we point out in our brief, DUI, littering, all kinds of minor crimes, the person can make a fairly convincing argument sometimes that evidence on the phone would be relevant to that crime of arrest. And so I think that brings me to where I want to end, which is understanding what the rule the government propounds would do in terms of just ordinary police work. Remember, this case starts with a traffic stop for an expired license plate. It is everyday police work that traffic stops are the beginning of criminal investigations and a leverage point into searches. If you adopt a rule that says, even a Gant rule, that says if you can make an argument that evidence on the phone would be relevant to the crime of arrest, take the suspended license, you may have an e­mail from the DMV telling you you better come in and renew. If that opens up every American's entire life to the police department, not just at the scene but later at the station house and downloaded into their computer forever, I think you will fundamentally have changed the nature of privacy that Americans fought for at the founding of the Republic and that we've enjoyed ever since.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start with Justice Sotomayor's question which I think has been asked a couple of other times today, which is, what would the answer be if this were a private defendant? And in footnote 11 of our brief on page 33, we explain why the answer would be that there would be specific jurisdiction. And in the Gibson­Dunn amicus brief at pages 25 to 29 they give a fuller explanation. No response ­­",
  "But, Justice Ginsburg, I think there are plenty of cases that support the proposition that when a company markets and sells a product in a jurisdiction, that creates specific jurisdiction. That's what OBB did through its agent, RPE, is market and sell its product.",
  "I agree with everything you said. But this case is different because our lawsuit is based on the duty of safe passage that gave rise in that sale ­­ in that ticket sale. So we're suing based on the promise and the offer ­­",
  "I'm not sure. And if somebody did draft that, it would certainly be subject to a 12(b)(6) ­­",
  "Well, all I can say is in this case, we're suing on the exact warranty that gives rise from this ticket sale, Justice Breyer. And I think ­­",
  "So, Justice Breyer, to ­­ let me be clear about what is and is not in that brief. There are no cases that I don't think any party has cited. What the ­­ what that brief says is that based on the language in various conventions, that this claim wouldn't be able to be brought somewhere else. But the language in those conventions are things like arise under, based upon, and so you basically end up in the same situation as you are here which is having to decide whether this claim can be brought. Remember that brief also alleges and it actually spends more time alleging that there is no proper principle­agent relationship, which I think is ­­ the Court has probably realized is not a very credible argument. So I think you should be careful about putting too much weight on a brief that simply cites some treaty language. But I think the point I want to make, and this ­­ for the hypotheticals and to bring it back to my case, and I also tie in the contract ­­",
  "We have none, and they have none. I have not found ­­",
  "You can ask him on rebuttal.",
  "I think the better reading of the word \"activity\" in the statute for the reasons we describe in our brief is the overall integrated activity of running the railway train enterprise, which includes selling the product and delivering the product.",
  "Well, I don't know why any country would have thought that about this country's law, because before this ­­ you know, up until this point, the law in the lower courts, the D.C. Circuit and the Second Circuit, and most ­­ most specifically, have held that in this exact situation, there is jurisdiction.",
  "And Justice Breyer ­­",
  "No. I'm glad you asked about Nelson, Mr. Chief Justice, because the paragraph in Nelson that Mr. Kneedler is referring to is distinguishing sovereign activity from commercial activity. The Court in Nelson did not have before it and was not concerned with the geographic nexus, and you know that because in that paragraph where it lists the things upon which the Nelsons' claim is not truly based, it lists not only the recruitment in the United States but the actual employment in Saudi Arabia.",
  "So ­­",
  "Justice Breyer ­­",
  "When the Court said the arguable commercial activities that preceded it, they were talking not only about the recruitment in the United States but also the employment itself in Saudi Arabia. And they were distinguishing that from the police activity of seizing somebody and holding him in jail, which was what the case was really about which were sovereign activities. So the Court in Nelson ­­ Mr. Chief Justice, to be clear, I'm not saying Nelson supports me. I think Nelson simply doesn't answer this question because you were concerned in that case with sovereign versus commercial, not geographic nexus.",
  "No, Your Honor. I ­­",
  "No. I think OBB is subject to jurisdiction under the ­­ or ­­ I'm sorry, I should say does not have sovereign immunity under the FSIA for its train operation of selling tickets and getting people rides on the trains. It wouldn't be subject to jurisdiction if it had some ­­ if it had a mining enterprise on the side or something else that didn't even touch the United States.",
  "So the activity ­­",
  "Well, let me say two things, Justice Kagan.",
  "Thank you. I think that is the fairest reading of the statute, and Mr. Kneedler was talking about the House Report. One of the examples in the House Report of a commercial activity was running an airline. It's hard to distinguish running an airline from running a train system.",
  "So the terms of the statue do cover that. If ­­ Justice Alito, may I ­­ may I just say one more thing to Justice Kagan?",
  "Which is if you didn't agree that the term \"commercial activity\" covered the entire enterprise, then you would ask the question whether the activity of selling tickets is enough to create a based­upon argument in a specific jurisdiction since we went back to the conversation we've been having.",
  "Well, there wouldn't necessarily be sovereign ­­ there may not be sovereign immunity under the terms of the Act. But obviously, there would be a number of reasons why that case couldn't be brought ­­",
  "Right. Which ­­ which ­­ on the ­­ taking everything else the same, has substantial contact to the United States. But all the ­­ all we're talking about in this case is immunity. Section 1330, where it has jurisdiction over foreign states, has ­­ says that that jurisdiction has to be in personam. And obviously, that would carry with it the requirements for in personam jurisdiction which would require a contact in this country. And this is one thing I want to make sure, is the Court understands to bring us back to the hypotheticals we were talking about earlier and to tie in the contract hypothetical, it's important for the Court to understand there are all manner of cases where a duty is created in this country by way of a foreign state's commercial activities, and then injuries or breaches occur a broad. In fact, this is rather the oddball case. The more typical case is a high­finance deal like the bonds case in the Weltover case, other kinds of international finance and loans. There are many employment cases where United States citizens sign an employment contract or are lured abroad, study abroad programs in the educational sphere, all kinds of situations where a duty is created in this country, but then all of the events that the lawsuit turns out to be about happen abroad.",
  "If that's the case ­­",
  "For all the reasons I was just saying, Justice Ginsburg, because it is utterly common for duties to be created in this country ­­ here, the duty of safe passage and of utmost care ­­ and then the breach to occur a broad. My ­­ my friend on the other side was correct to say this case is indistinguishable from contract cases. There are ­­ there are all kinds of cases where duties are created in this country and then breached abroad.",
  "The lower courts have always held that the FSIA ­­",
  "I think when I answered your question I was imagining there wasn't a duty created. Maybe as Justice Breyer amended the hypothetical, there might be ­­",
  "Right.",
  "I would say if the plaintiff alleges that in the lawsuit, then there would not be sovereign immunity. And then Justice Alito's ­­ I think as he was saying earlier, you would have a ­­ perhaps a very strong 12(b)(6) argument that there's no such State law claim that actually gave rise in that context.",
  "I think that's right, Mr. Chief Justice, but ­­ as long as you're talking about buying a ticket one place to the other. But of course that's true of any seller of any product that they ­­ that they stand ­­ you know, they offer the same thing depending on where you buy it. But the critical thing is where did they sell their ticket? They reached out to this country ­­ and it is worth answering your question with this important point, which is the product that they sold to Ms. Sachs is not available to Austrian citizens. This is a specially­tailored product available only ­­",
  "It would ­­",
  "That might be correct, but it is important not to lose sight of the fact that she didn't buy her ticket there. OBB reached out into this forum. And just going back to this Court's ordinary due process cases, when a business purposefully avails itself of the protections and the opportunities of a particular jurisdiction ­­",
  "No. Fair enough. But you have to have a contact, and that's the substantial contact test in this ­­ in this case ­­",
  "And you have to have a relationship, which we do, because we purchased it here.",
  "Yeah.",
  "It's not right because what you were worried about in Nelson is artful pleading to get around true sovereign immunity; in other words, to challenge sovereign acts dressed up as something else. Here there's no allegation that we're challenging sovereign acts. Everybody agrees we're challenging commercial acts. There's only the geographic nexus question. So we can plead a tort however we like subject to Rule 12(b)(6), which they can make on remand. And, Mr. Chief Justice, maybe I could turn back to one of yours questions, because I think it further highlights the difficulty with the other side's test. It has to be enough for a duty to create a cause of action, we say, because otherwise you're left with this gravamen test. And either ­­ gravamen test has to mean one of two things: Either it has to mean that only one particular place can be the gravamen, which is the way I understood it from their briefing. But as the Court, I think, is figuring out from this argument, you get into all heaps of troubles with contracts, employment, all kinds of other things where the injuries occur abroad, and how on earth is the Court to determine where the gravamen is. On the other hand, if gravamen is sort of a grava­person's test so that you can have many multiple places where a claim can be brought, then I'm at a loss to understand how it's any improvement over the one element ­­",
  "Under due process, you'd have jurisdiction in Nevada.",
  "The gravamen?",
  "No, it ­­",
  "The most ­­ there's a most significant relationship ­­",
  "­­ every State, it says.",
  "I think it's sometimes one and sometimes the other, Justice Breyer.",
  "Pardon me?",
  "It depends ­­",
  "It depends ­­",
  "No, I think ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "I've never seen this term used in the case law. And I think the other side was correct when they answered ­­",
  "Well, all I can do is honestly answer that I've never seen this test used in any choice of law analysis.",
  "I will add that ­­",
  "Well, the Ninth Circuit held that California law applies in this case, and OBB has never ­­ has not challenged that holding. So as the case comes to this Court, California law applies for purposes of the one element ­­",
  "In all candor, Justice Ginsburg, there'd be a pretty good argument that Austria law should apply. And it is important for the Court to understand that simply holding that a suit under the FSIA can be brought in this country does not mean that U.S. law applies. There's a separate choice of law analysis that can be made. And so OBB had the opportunity to make choice of law arguments and has decided not to. But remember, they can do choice of law analysis not only in terms of ordinary common law principles that might apply in a court, but there's a number of ways that a defendant in OBB's position can protect itself in a case like this. First of all, they can put a choice of law provision in the ticket, or in the contract, or whatever might be at issue. Second of all, even as to forum, forum selection clauses can be put into tickets like this, and contracts, and in fact they are. As the United States told the Court at the cert stage of this case, all of these tickets now are governed by a forum selection clause provision, so you'll never see a case like this again, not only in the railroad context, but even in the airline industry.",
  "Under Carnival Cruise Lines, this Court's decision, those kinds of forum selection clauses are perfectly enforceable.",
  "Well, I don't know why it would be different in this context, Justice Kennedy. Certainly the government says that these are all governed by forum selection clauses now. We think they are, too. So what you're really deciding in this case, if I could end where perhaps I began, is you're not deciding transportation in this case, because all transportation cases are now covered by conventions and forum selection causes. What you're really deciding is what the law should be in the mainstream FSIA cases, like finance, like contracts. That's why Gibson­Dunn has filed a case on behalf of a ­­ of a large hedge fund that says, we do business all the time with foreign sovereigns and we're very worried that if the Court adopts this gravamen based­upon, we will not be able to enforce contracts and duties in this country that have given rise under negotiations in this country and then are breached abroad. Employment situations, like the hypothetical we give in our brief, where a United States citizen is hired as an engineer to go do oil and gas exploration and then something happens abroad. Those cases have always been brought in this country. And if this Court adopts the gravamen test, what you'll be saying is the courts now have some amorphous test that would seem, especially if there is only a single gravamen, that would seem to bounce all of these cases out of the United States courts, which would be dramatically ­­",
  "Well, I think there is two reasons why you couldn't just limit it to that, Justice Ginsburg. First, as a legal matter, our claim depends on the duty that arose when that ticket's purchase was made. And I don't see any legal way to distinguish duties that arose in a ticket sale from other kinds of duties that arise and all kinds of other marketing and contract settings. And second of all, just as a matter of common sense, remember ­­ let's go back to where we began ­­ this is a commercial activity exception. If they weren't selling tickets, it wouldn't even be commercial to begin with. So it would be a highly odd holding to say that the one thing that makes this commercial is what prevents it from being brought in the United States.",
  "That's right, Justice Ginsburg. And if you want us to ask the question in terms of whether a private company would be subject to jurisdiction under the same settings here, at least all you have to hold is that OBB should be in the same shoes as a private company. Now, we say in our brief and in the Gibson brief in more detail, why due process wouldn't stand in the way of jurisdiction there. But if you have any doubt about that, you can note that OBB has made a personal jurisdiction argument in the district court that the district court never reached. And so that is available on remand. The only thing before this Court is sovereign immunity and whether OBB is entitled to sovereign immunity for commercial acts in this country and the teeth of a congressional statute that says in the declaration of purpose in Section 1602 that foreign states doing commercial activities in this country should not be entitled to sovereign immunity. And then in Section 1606 says: What we want to do is ­­",
  "Pardon me?",
  "No.",
  "No.",
  "Because ­­ because what the definition of in the United States, Justice Breyer, and this is sub (D) of 1603(c), says that ­­ I'm sorry, it's sub ­­ sub (E) of 1603(c) says that \"in the United States\" is defined as substantial contact with the United States. And so that can occur in whole or in part in this country, and in part ­­ I'm sorry, in part includes the ticket sale."
