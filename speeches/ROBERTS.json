  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Twice the driver in this case tested positive for illegal drugs, and twice the company that employed him to drive its 25-ton vehicles in West Virginia tried to fire him. Each time an arbitrator ordered the driver reinstated. The second time the company went to court, arguing that the reinstatement award should not be enforced because it was contrary to public policy to put this driver back behind the wheel. The district court and the court of appeals, however, rejected that argument and concluded that because reinstatement was not illegal, the public policy exception to the enforceability of contracts, quote, does not apply, unquote.",
  "Yes. The agreement said that in the case of a positive drug test the driver was subject to sanctions up to and including termination, and the arbitrator concluded that in this case they hadn't established just cause. That, of course, is the predicate for the application of the public policy exception in every case, the fact that the contract provides a result that is different from the one the parties are arguing for under public policy.",
  "Yes, there was a proposal, and it was just not adopted.",
  "We don't know if it was because it was regarded as too strict or not strict enough.",
  "Certainly after one positive test.",
  "The question of a --",
  "No. The question of a recidivist is not addressed by the regulations at all.",
  "What the regulations provide -- and we agree with the Solicitor General's reading of the regulations. We don't take issue with it -- is that in a case of a positive drug test a couple of things have to happen. The driver, before he can go back to work, has to pass the minimum requirements, which is just evaluation by a substance abuse professional and pass a return-to-work test, and then whether or not the driver gets his job back is left to private ordering. Now, if that private ordering takes the form of a contract, a collective bargaining agreement, that contract should be subject to the public policy exception just like every other contract is. There is not --",
  "Well, we could have tried. Whether or not it would have been the result of the collective bargaining practice is another question.",
  "The arbitrator determined that we didn't, I think is the best way to put it. Now -- but under this court's decision in Kaiser Steel, though, even if we had signed a contract that was illegal, we'd still have standing to object to that.",
  "Yes. There's no question about that. Again, all that does is pose the question under the public policy exception.",
  "Well, if the union agreed to it, if it were phrased in such a way that it were not subject to an arbitrator's misinterpretation, and it's also the case that it may not be the best result.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, there are some contracts. In other cases unions have resisted them, and in other cases perhaps the employer recognizes that an absolute rule may not be the best result.",
  "That's right, and for a very important reason, is because the doctrine that we're talking about is a doctrine of contract law. It only applies when the question of the enforcement of a contract is at issue. That is an important limitation on the public policy role for the courts, and --",
  "Oh, but there is something very much that constrains the company's choice in that situation, and that's tort law. The same public policy that informs the exercise of the public policy exception when the court is asked to enforce the contract restrains what the company can do on its own unilaterally.",
  "If the -- the question would come up when someone wanted to enforce a contract.",
  "Yes, it would not prevent the application of the public policy exception. The -- in every case that the question comes up, whether it's this case or the Kensington --",
  "It would not prevent the court --",
  "Well, what it would prohibit, depending on the circumstances, and the Town of Newton case said this is a very fact-intensive inquiry on the court's part, when the court is asked to enforce the two strikes, and he should be fired, the fact that the contract provided three strikes doesn't act as an absolute bar. It is always the case when the public policy question comes up that the contract provides something else.",
  "Yes. The public policy exception is the one this Court articulated in Town of Newton, which is that courts have not only the authority but the obligation to decline to enforce contracts that are illegal or that violate public policy. Now, to determine whether they violate public policy, what this Court did was adopt the Restatement test, one that has been developed over centuries of common law, which asks whether the interests in enforcing the agreement are outweighed in the circumstances by a public policy harm by the enforcement of the agreement.",
  "Well --",
  "Certainly. The public policy in this case is the public policy against the use of illegal drugs by those in safety-sensitive positions. Now, that policy is well-defined, because Congress and the executive have said what those positions are, not the courts. Congress and the executive have said it covers these substances, not the courts, and the policy is so strong that Congress has said, we're going to test you to make sure that the policy is implemented, and Congress and the executive have said how that testing should be done, and how often. The courts --",
  "Well, at that point you get into the fact-intensive weighing that this Court in Town of Newton says, said has to be done. In other words, you have to look at all of the circumstances and determine whether that policy --",
  "Well --",
  "With respect to the one strike I think the regulations would prevent that in most situations, because they contemplate that in some circumstances you can be reinstated, so there should not be an absolute rule of one strike and you're out. Now, the objection Your Honor raises is the same objection that could have been raised in the Town of Newton case. How do you tell which release dismissal agreement violates the policies underlying section 1983? It's an objection that has been raised with respect to the public policy exception since the beginning. Go back to the Muschany case and even before that. And yet the exception has endured because the courts have recognized that if courts do not ensure that contracts do not violate public policy, no one else can.",
  "Absolutely, yes.",
  "Well, one -- yes -- well, in the testing, but what the Court said in Muschany, repeated in Grace and in Misco, is, courts just don't pluck these policies out of the air. You have to look to the laws and legal precedents. You look to the testing act, the DOT regulations, the drug-free work place acts, and one thing they establish is a strong policy of deterrence. They didn't think that by imposing this testing regime they would catch everybody who's using drugs. What they thought was, if people knew they were going to be tested and consequences were going to flow from that, people would stop using drugs.",
  "Yes. I think --",
  "I think it is. Now, there may be --",
  "I -- first of all, I think that's the policy as a general matter. I don't think -- again, this is not an area where the Court adopts general categorical rules. For example, if the two tests are 15 years apart, or something like that, perhaps in that situation it doesn't make sense to say you cannot be reinstated. That of course is not the situation here.",
  "Well, first of all, the application of the exception is in no way inconsistent with the deference to arbitrators. In the Grace case, which involved --",
  "You have --",
  "You have a common law rule that authorizes and obligates courts to apply this, and the argument, as I understand it, and it is the union's argument, is that you should have an exception to that rule in the labor area because we defer to arbitrators, but we defer to arbitrators because they have expertise in the interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement. That is not the question when it comes to public policy. As this Court --",
  "Well, no. That depends on what the collective bargaining agreement provides, and collective bargaining agreements do not shape public policy. They shape a private agreement between an employer and a union, and as this --",
  "As this Court said in the Wright decision, the deference that is accorded arbitrators is limited by the rationale that supports it.",
  "No, Your Honor. I think they're both entitled to the same weight, and all that the arbitrator's decision does is tell you what the parties agreed to. They say, this interpretation is binding on the parties. Well, that just poses the question that is presented. When you have an application of the public policy doctrine you assume that the parties have agreed to something else. In the Kensington case, Mrs. Bleaker signed an agreement limiting her -- the liability of the company to 250 francs.",
  "Because the criminal sanctions that Your Honor addressed don't take into account what the contract enforcement is going to bring about, and that is, putting this individual, who in the course of 15 months failed two tests for illegal drugs, behind the wheel of a 25-ton vehicle on the roads in West Virginia.",
  "Again --",
  "The court knows that because Congress told it that. Congress drew a distinction in the testing act. It said, when we test for alcohol we test when you're there performing the functions, because you have to be sober. It's all right if you're going to have a drink on Saturday night. And it took a different approach when it came to illegal drugs. It said where --",
  "The issue there would be whether that undermined the deterrent effect of the testing program. In other words, if the consequence for taking drugs and putting the lives of the traveling public at risk is you get a desk job rather than you're behind the wheel, that would undermine what Congress was trying to do.",
  "In the -- on the facts of this case, in other words a second positive test, not the first test, I think yes, although the argument for public policy would not be as strong.",
  "I was just going to emphasize that what Congress sought to achieve, and what the Department of Transportation is seeking to achieve, is deterrence, and if the consequences are so minimal, as in Your Honor's hypothetical, that undermines the deterrent effect. How do the other drivers who are subject to this test take it seriously, when they see someone who's failed twice --",
  "Well, Your Honor, we don't know why they didn't adopt it. They may not have adopted it --",
  "-- because they thought termination was --",
  "Because when you're dealing with a second offense, someone who failed the first drug test they had to take, then failed another one given 14 months after they were reinstated, after they had been through the rehabilitation process, we tried what the statute and the regulations provide, and it didn't work.",
  "The assumption underlying your question is that the regulation somehow occupies the field. In other words, they addressed the full universe of situations that can arise. They plainly did not. There's --",
  "I would suppose because neither Congress nor the Department ever supposed you'd have an arbitrator who would reinstate someone who failed two tests within 15 months to this type of a position. It's --",
  "I don't want to --",
  "I'm not aware of any, and I don't want to limit what the company will be arguing in the future, but if you accept the interpretation that the arbitrator's decision is an interpretation of the contract, I don't know how much of a defense that's going to be.",
  "Yes. Yes, Your Honor.",
  "Well, I'm sure that's what the argument --",
  "I'm sure that's what the argument would be.",
  "On the other hand, the contract, like every contract, is subject to the public policy exception. Now, it is an exception that is applicable only in the rare case, but those cases do come up. The union today is arguing that there's no role for the courts here, but in the Jones Dairy Farm case it was a union that was arguing for the public policy exception against the management rule that employees had to report unsanitary conditions only to management. The Solicitor General is arguing against the exception today, but when it was a Federal postal worker that they were trying to fire and an arbitrator ordered him reinstated, then the Solicitor General was saying no, the court should vacate that arbitration award. These situations come up with sufficient regularity, sometimes the shoe is on one foot and sometimes on the other, but the fact of the public policy exception has to be recognized, and the one thing that is clear, it seems, is that the lower court approach, which said this is not illegal, therefore there's no role for the public policy exception, is inconsistent with this Court's decision. The formulation has always been the public policy exception applies to contracts that are illegal or that violate public policy, and with respect --",
  "No. There are two --",
  "Well, that's what the Court said in Town of Newton, and I think it's correct. There is not a clear line, but what the Court has said -- and there are two aspects to the question. How do you tell what the policy is, how do you tell whether it's violated. On the policy question, what the Court has said is, it has to be well-defined, and you have to point to the laws of legal precedents. That's satisfied here. The definition of this testing program is spelled out in detail by Congress and the Department of Transportation.",
  "That's the policy of the testing act. Congress has said that, and that is the policy that is at issue here.",
  "Well, what the regs say, according to the Solicitor General, and we agree, is that it's left to private ordering, and if it's left to private ordering in the form of a contract, the public policy exception applies. Now, that's as far as we got in the lower courts. Then the lower courts said, we're not going to look at it because it's not illegal. One reason I think it may be seen difficult to manage the application here is that the district court hasn't done it, and the court of appeals hasn't done it in this case.",
  "That's an important limitation on this, is on the public policy exception, which is that it only applies when the courts are asked to enforce the contract.",
  "He wouldn't be making the court --",
  "He wouldn't be making the court an accomplice to the violation of public policy. He would be restrained, of course, by tort law. I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor. I have just three very brief points. First, the lower courts did not address the questions we have been discussing this morning. They adopted the position that because this award was not illegal, the public policy exception does not apply. I understand the Solicitor General's representative to agree with us that that is an incorrect statement of the standard. At the very least, then, it seems appropriate to vacate the decision and send it back for the lower courts to at least apply the correct standard. Second, take no comfort in the certification of the substance abuse professional. My brother for the union said that he certifies that the employee successfully completed rehabilitation. That is not correct. All that the substance abuse professional certifies is that the employee properly followed the program, not that it worked, not that it was likely to work, and certainly not that the employee does not present a risk to the public, and also keep in mind that the professional obligation of the SAP is to the employee, not to the public safety. He could easily determine that it's best for this employee to be back on the job, even if that represents a threat to public safety. Finally, you can look through the regulations in excruciating detail. You will not find a provision addressing the problem of a recidivist. The Department may have considered some things. It didn't adopt them. It seems an awful lot of weight to place on the failure to adopt a provision to conclude that someone who violates these rules 20 times is to be treated exactly like someone who violates it one time. That is insufficient to protect public safety. What the regulations provide is that this issue, reinstatement, is left to contract. If it is left to contract, the public policy exception applies. In the reported cases alone, you will find examples of arbitrators ordering the reinstatement of nurses who prescribed the wrong medication and stood by while patients were dying, the helmsman of a 635-foot oil tanker who was on marijuana and ran it aground, the nuclear plant operator who diffused the safety system at the plant so he could leave early for lunch, and the pilot of a 727 who flew it while blind drunk. The public policy exception is needed for those types of cases, and we respectfully submit that the case of a driver of a 25-ton vehicle in West Virginia who has twice failed drug tests fits in that category. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For three reasons, police officers who have probable cause to believe that a residence contains incriminating evidence may prevent entry for a reasonable period of time in order to preserve the evidence while they obtain a search warrant. First, there's a strong law enforcement interest in preserving evidence pending issuance of a warrant. Second, securing the premises from the outside by preventing entry is a limited and temporary intrusion. Third, it's less intrusive than other means of preserving evidence, and it promotes fidelity to the Fourth Amendment's preference that searches be authorized by a warrant. When a residence contains evidence of a crime, there's an inherent danger that the evidence may be damaged or destroyed if people are allowed on the premises, and therefore, unless police have a means to protect the evidence during the time that it takes to obtain a warrant, the search pursuant to the warrant may often be fruitless.",
  "No, all evidence is not fungible, Your Honor, but almost all evidence is capable of alteration or destruction, or damage in some way.",
  "No.",
  "All evidence that's capable of alteration or destruction isn't fungible either, but there's a sufficient inherent danger of some kind of damage with -- damage or destruction of evidence under the circumstances that the risk would be too great in enough cases to warrant asking for some particularized --",
  "Certainly not when all we're talking about is temporarily preventing entry for a limited period of time.",
  "Yes, and --",
  "Our rule that we're proposing here that has already been reflected in cases involving containers, vehicles, and evidence in plain view, and the Court suggested in dicta it applies to securing residences as well, is easily applied. The issue is, is there probable cause to believe that the residence contains evidence of a crime, and if there is probable cause to believe that, then there is a consequent --",
  "Well, the Court's made clear --",
  "The Court's made clear that any search or seizure, even one that's justified by a warrant, can be rendered unreasonable by the manner in which it's executed, and one factor that you would consider in determining whether the seizure --",
  "No, Your Honor. The basic principle would still apply, but the police officers have to act reasonably. That's, the fundamental principle of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, and if under the circumstances reasonableness required some accommodation of the needs that were -- that the occupants were impeded from addressing because of the seizure, the police would have to reasonably address that. If there was a child inside, I think that would create exigent circumstances that would justify them going in to take care of the child if there were some need to do that.",
  "There may be circumstances which require the police to take other actions to address the needs as reasonable, but the fundamental rule remains the same, and I don't think that is different than in any other circumstance, any other kind of --",
  "I think that if -- if -- unless the officer had -- knew that there wasn't a kid in there, which in this case he might know because the wife --",
  "He could. He could accompany him inside. That's what I was trying to say before, Mr. Chief Justice. If there was a child who was -- who needed protection that much that required the respondent to enter, then that would justify the police officer going in in the interest of public safety.",
  "If the child were outside and wanted to go in and was old enough --",
  "Oh, the officer could ask the child to come out under those circumstances.",
  "Well then, that would certainly create exigent circumstances that would justify going in to secure the premises from the inside, but this case involves a very different and much more limited situation, where all that was necessary was to prevent entry and that kind of intrusion is extremely more limited, because it's only possessory interest in the premises. It lasts only long enough to get the judicial determination about whether there's probable cause to search and seize, and it's far less intrusive than the other alternatives. For instance, if the police officers here had arrested respondent, that would have invaded his personal privacy and his liberty.",
  "The --",
  "The legality depends on the presence of probable cause. I think at the time that they conducted the seizure they would have had probable cause and the seizure would be legal.",
  "Even if the warrant were not issued. As I was saying before, the -- part of the reason that the intrusion is so small, is limited here, and that this is particularly reasonable, is that the other alternatives such as arresting the occupants, such as a warrantless entry, are more intrusive, involve invasions of privacy. They're more serious, and by providing an alternative to immediate warrantless entry this external impoundment option actually encourages police officers to seek a warrant before they search. The Court has therefore recognized a principle that the interest in protecting evidence can temporarily supersede possessory interest in property for the time that it takes to get a warrant in a variety of contexts. As I noted before, the Court's done it in dictum in situations involving securing premises, but the Court's held that that's true in a variety of cases like container cases, where the Court has held that if the police have probable cause to believe the container holds evidence they can seize the container pending a warrant to search it, and the Court's held that if the police have probable cause to believe that evidence that's in plain view is associated with criminal activity, they can seize it. The same principle that underlies that, the interest in protecting the evidence, the inherent danger that the evidence may be damaged or destroyed if there isn't an ability to freeze the status quo while the police get a warrant, the fact that the police are getting the warrant here, all point to the fact that it's eminently reasonable for the police to be able to secure the premises from the outside for a temporary time while they obtain a warrant to search. If there are no further questions --",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The president and founder of Marketing Displays, Incorporated, MDI, invented a new type of sign stand, one with a dual-spring design that allowed the stand to resist the wind. MDI patented that invention and, for the term of its patents, MDI labeled its sign stands as patent- protected to warn of copiers, touted in its trade literature the benefit of its, quote, patented dual- spring design, end quote, and when another company, Windproof, tried to market a copy of MDI's patented stand, MDI sued it for patent infringement and won. But then MDI's patents expired, as under the Constitution all patents eventually must. Sometime thereafter, Traffix Devices, the petitioner, copied MDI's stand, added some improvements of its own, and marketed a competing version. No longer armed with its patents, MDI tried a new tack to exclude competition. It claimed that the configuration of its stand, the same dual-spring design that it had touted as patent-protected during the term of the patents, was protected as trade dress and could not be copied.",
  "Well, in this case, of course, it's easy to determine that the patent covers this particular sign stand because MDI labeled that sign stand as patent-protected.",
  "The whole sign stand, yes.",
  "And all, but in its trade literature, for example, it focused on the dual-spring design. That is what makes the invention work. That's what allows it to resist the wind, and it said, this is our patented dual-spring design and, of course, it not only labeled the stands but in its trade literature, and in the Windproof case it sued when somebody made an exact replica, the same replica that Traffix Devices --",
  "Well --",
  "Well, incidental ornamentation that is not part of what the patent protects does not give rise to the right to copy. There should be an exact symmetry. Whatever the patent had protected as part of the patent bargain, the public has the right to copy. Now, the color of the legs probably would not have been claimed in the patent, and wouldn't have been part of the invention, and therefore it would not give rise to a right to copy that color.",
  "Well, it depends on which stand is involved. The steel stand is one color and the aluminum stand is another, but in terms of what they claimed in the patent as -- the part that makes the invention work, it's not the legs that made this invention. It's not the sign. It is the dual-spring design. That's what they said was patented. When they marketed this, when they had the exclusive right to do so, they focused on that in their trade literature, said this is our patented dual-spring design, and that is the same claim they now raise in their trade dress assertion.",
  "It said we -- it said we basically had to design around their stand. Now, if they said, you could use three springs or four springs, I guess it would never end, five springs, or you could put a little skirt around the springs so people wouldn't see them, or, as Your Honor points out, if you're going to use the springs you have to change something else so it doesn't look like it. But that's not what this Court's cases have held. What the Court has said, Singer and Kellogg and Sears, is that the public has the right to copy the patented invention in precisely the form in which it was practiced, and that's critically important. The idea of designing around what had previously been patented is a significant hindrance to competition, and this case is a good example. When we copied the sign we added an important improvement of our own, the step-and-drop leg. Under MDI's stand you have to bend over and pull the pins out. Under ours, you just step and the legs come out. Now, if the rule were the rule that the respondents are arguing for, we would have had to add that new improvement to some different sign stand, but the right to copy attaches to the product as it was practiced during the term of the patent. We don't have to design around their superior stand -- that's why it succeeded in getting the patent -- to add improvements of our own.",
  "We think there is a freestanding right to copy from an expired patent, that it doesn't depend upon what functionality is.",
  "If the item was simply incidental ornamentation -- one of their amici used the example, if you're patenting a chair and the drawing shows a purple bow. Well, we don't think there's a right to copy the purple bow, because the purple bow is not covered. That's not the invention.",
  "In the item itself, yes, but not in the subject of the patent.",
  "Functionality I think leads to the same place that we come to from looking at patent law, if you define functionality as it has traditionally been defined, as turning on usefulness. If functional -- if functional means useful, then our case comes out the same way, because you have to be useful to get a patent, and if it's been the subject of a patent, the feature has been useful, therefore it's functional, therefore it's not eligible for trade dress protection.",
  "Exactly, and functionality --",
  "Functionality is sufficient if functionality means useful, but if functionality means, as the lower court said in this case, something for which there is a competitive need, or for which there are not available alternatives, and there's a multi-factor balancing test to determine so-called legal functionality --",
  "Well, we --",
  "I don't think Qualitex opined on the exact definition of functionality in this case, or it was misread by the lower court. The definition in Qualitex had a very important connector there. It said, a useful product feature, or, and then it went on to talk about competitive need, so --",
  "Period, without regard to competitive need, available alternatives -- MDI's position is, look, you can make a sign that stands up to the wind that's just as good as our sign stand, so don't make it the way we made it, but the patent, the expired patent gives us the right to copy --",
  "I think Justice Brandeis' opinion in Kellogg answers that. Kellogg did not have to show that there was no way to make or sell shredded wheat other than in the pillow-shaped biscuit form that Nabisco had made famous when it had its patent. It was enough that that was the form in which Nabisco had practiced its patent. Kellogg therefore could copy it, even though they could have made shredded wheat some other way, and that's important precisely because of the purpose of the patent bargain to promote competition. As I said, why -- if we have an improvement to this sign stand, the step-and-drop legs, why should we have to add it only to a very different sign stand? It's the commercially proven version that the public has the right to copy. That is important to enhance competition. To require people, if they're going to make improvements, to design around the form that the public had become accustomed to, would inhibit competition, and --",
  "Yes. You're dealing with what is in the trade dress area essentially judge-made law, and it has expanded in various ways, and functionality -- it doesn't interfere with the patent bargain if functionality means a broad range of other things, but so long as it is also satisfied completely by a demonstration that it is a useful product feature. There may be other limitations on a trade dress claim going to competitive need, available alternatives, any of the various multi-factor tests, but if functionality is going to serve the purpose of demarking the regime of trademark and trade dress and patent law, it must be satisfied by a showing that it is a useful product feature and in our case that's significant, because you can't get a utility patent as MDI had, without showing that it's a useful product feature, so the fact that they had a utility patent, that it covered the dual-spring design, should be enough to establish functionality and therefore should be enough to reject their trade dress claim.",
  "I think it is the expansion of the concept of configuration trade dress that has given rise to this issue and the problem. If you go back to where trademark was limited to marks on the product, of course, the product could be patented, the trademark is fine. If you even then go the next step, and you're talking about trade dress and packaging, again, so long as it's distinct from the product, there's no interference with patent. But when you start saying that the configuration of the product itself is entitled to protection as trade dress, you bump right into the patent law, because the key to the patent bargain is, if you're going to control a useful product feature, as the Court said in Qualitex, that's the regime of patent law, and it's no answer to say, well, we're protected by patent law and when the patent expires we're protected under trade dress law, because that takes away the public's half of the patent bargain. We're giving exclusive right to an inventor for a term of years on the condition that he or she disclose what the invention is, and that the public obtains a right to copy it when the patent expires. So yes, I mean, it is the expansion of product configuration trade dress that has given rise to this problem, and I would at least suggest that the Court should not get on board with that expansion without waiting for Congress to say something about it, particularly given the fact that it so directly impinges upon the central patent bargain underlying the patent system.",
  "Certainly, yes, and --",
  "Well, it gives rise to an important distinction. In other words, having been covered by the patent, another producer knows that when it comes off patent he can copy it, and that's how it worked in this case. Traffix Devices knew -- they were in the business -- this was a patented sign stand, they couldn't make it, it comes off patent, they can make it. Now, if they at that point had to -- instead, if respondent's position were adopted, they had to go to their lawyer and say, is this legally functional, their lawyer would tell them, well, it depends. There are six factors in this circuit, there are eight factors in the other circuit. We've got to get expert economic testimony. It depends on consumer surveys. By that time the producer says, forget it, it's not worth the candle, I'll go make something else, and competition suffers.",
  "Well, you know, a little bit of a loophole suddenly expands, particularly when you have a multi --",
  "Well, of course, in this case it's easy. The key to the invention --",
  "-- and producers all the time compete all the time in the confines of patents. They have to look at a patent and decide, can I make a competing product or not, so it's not a new inquiry, and in the typical case such as this, where you have a product coming off patent, you will have the conduct of the patentee, which will illuminate exactly what he thought was covered. Here, we not only have the labeling and the trade literature, we have the Windproof litigation. Someone made the exact same sign here and he said, a-ha, that infringes my patent. Well, if it did infringe his patent, and the Ninth Circuit concluded it did, then the public has a right to copy. I'd like to reserve --",
  "Yes. The patent displays what they call a business sign, with two springs far apart. The Traffix sign, the one at issue in Windproof and at issue here, the springs are closely together. MDI argued successfully that made no difference, that the two closely spaced springs were covered by the patent to the same extent as the farther apart springs. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor. There was until this morning no dispute that moving the springs closer together was functional. If you look at petition appendix page 54a, there is the explanation from MDI's chief engineer that doing so makes the sign more compact and weighs less, very important if you're ferrying these things up and down the highway, and also makes it less expensive to manufacture. As far as the two different sign stands, the diamond one with the closely spaced springs, joint appendix page 236, MDI said that those signs, even though the other one was depicted in their patent, that the closely spaced springs were, quote, slavish copies from the standpoint of function of the sign stand described and claimed in the Sartesian patents. Third, that is the form in which they practiced their patent, the closely spaced springs. Kellogg, Singer, Sears, that line of cases gives Traffix Devices and any member of the public the right to copy the patent in the form in which it was practiced. That is critically important to maintain competition. Whether you begin with patent law and the right to copy from an expired patent, or trade dress law and the definition of functionality that focuses on usefulness, is it a useful product figure, you come to the same point. Traffix Devices had the right to copy the MDI sign stand when it came off patent, and it did so. It did so in the way Bonito Boats explains enhances competition, imitation and refinement through imitation by adding an improvement of its own that made a more competitive product better for highway safety departments.

  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When the seller of a stock option misrepresents its intention to permit the buyer to exercise the option, the seller violates Section 10(b). The text of Section 10(b) prohibits the use of any manipulative or deceptive device in connection with --",
  "The seller of the option.",
  "Which here is Wharf Cable -- sold the stock option which was the right to purchase -- excuse me.",
  "A sale took place. At the meeting, there was a contract, as was explained, the contract was an exchange of a promise to provide services for the sale of the option. The promise was performed --",
  "I sell you an option in exchange for your promise to perform services, and that there was performance, which would take that contract out of the statute of frauds.",
  "Under the understanding that there was a sale for a promise, yes. You know, under the understanding there was a sale for services.",
  "I don't think it makes any difference, Your Honor.",
  "Well, there was performance of the promise which would take it out of the statute of frauds. Even if it is was a contract that was unilateral, the performance of the services would take it out of the statute of frauds as well, and once the option was purchased, the option was a security, and the misrepresentation of the intention to permit the exercise of the option was a misrepresentation.",
  "What the jury found was that they entered into a contract selling them an option for -- to purchase ten percent of the stock. I don't recall right at the moment -- I don't have it in front of me -- that finding. I'm not sure whether it said in exchange for the promise or not in the specific language of that finding, but the finding was on page E21.",
  "Yes, Your Honor, and you don't do that, because in order for there to be a 10(b)(5) violation, there must be a misrepresentation. There has to be a fraud, not just a breach of contract.",
  "It's not sufficient, Your Honor. Just as it's easy to allege, it's very hard to prove. In order to avoid dismissal under the Private Litigation Securities Reform Act, the plaintiff has to allege with particularity facts that give rise to a belief that there was misrepresentation --",
  "That would be insufficient to meet that burden, Your Honor. The fact that he's defending a suit, obviously, would be insufficient. And the plaintiff's own testimony about what he thought the defendant's intention was does not prove the state of the defendant's mind, nor does the fact that the defendant failed to perform prove anything more than a breach of contract. The restatement makes that clear -- that same principle would apply. Failure to perform alone is not sufficient. There has to be additional evidence, and there was additional evidence in this case -- both testimonial and documentary evidence -- that there was no intention to perform at the time. In addition, it's important to understand that - - it's important to cover oral contracts such as these because many contracts for the purchase of securities are oral, such as when customers contract with their brokers over the telephone to buy stock. And oral contracts for the sale of securities are generally enforceable under the law of all fifty States. In addition to that, the Act does not require that there be a writing to make someone a purchaser or a seller of a security. The Act provides that the options are securities, and the Act also provides that a purchase includes any contract purchase.",
  "No, I don't, Your Honor. I think the statute of frauds is irrelevant to a violation of Section 10(b). The statute of frauds is a --",
  "There is no requirement. Even under common law, the traditional rule is that fraud in inducing a contract is actionable, even if the contract is unenforceable under the statute of frauds. The same principle applies to Section 10(b), as well, and --",
  "Whether something -- no, a contract is a Federal term in the statute; it is a Federal question, I think whether it's a contract --",
  "There's court authority for the fact that purchasers -- parties to an oral contract to purchase are purchasers of securities.",
  "Notwithstanding State law?",
  "No, they don't specifically address notwithstanding State law, but in the court of appeals case that comes to mind, the Threadgill case from the D.C. Circuit, the district court had said that there was no purchase or sale because the contract had not been performed, fully performed, and the court of appeals reversed and said that the Act defines contract to include -- the Act defines purchase, excuse me, to include any contract to purchase.",
  "I don't think so, Your Honor. It wouldn't serve the purposes of the Securities Act for --",
  "First, you don't have to address that issue here because there is a --",
  "I don't think that you should look to State law for any of these questions, Your Honor. It's a question of --",
  "If there's fraud --",
  "Whether it's a sale under State law is a question of State law, whether it's a sale for purposes of the Securities Act is a question of Federal law. And it wouldn't serve the purposes of Section 10(b) to hold that because there isn't a sale that's enforceable under State law --",
  "Yes, Your Honor, Congress does. But Congress simply used the term contract in the definition of purchase to include any contract, and used the term contract, and that was commonly understood at that time, if I may issue that answer.",
  "Sorry. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A front pay award under Title VII is not subject to the cap on compensatory and punitive damages added by the 1991 Civil Rights Act. The 1991 Act provided new relief and generally capped that new relief, but the Act did not cap remedies that were already authorized such as front pay, which has traditionally been awarded when reinstatement is delayed or impractical. And the 1991 Act expressly excludes from the cap damages relief authorized under Section 706(g).",
  "Yes, Your Honor. At the time Congress drafted the 1991 Act, which is when it said is authorized, the courts of appeals had uniformly held that front pay was authorized under Section 706(g), so when Congress --",
  "As affirmative action or other equitable relief. Yes, Your Honor.",
  "Well, I don't think it has to be characterized as other equitable relief. It could fall under such affirmative action language, but even assuming that it falls under the other equitable relief, there was no legal relief that was provided in 1991 that's a substitute for the equitable relief that was already available --",
  "Yes. Compensatory damages were provided, but Congress was careful to indicate that it meant those damages to be in addition to the relief that was available, and that it was -- that the relief that was available under Section 706(g), it excluded it from the compensatory --",
  "That is available, that is authorized.",
  "I think our arguments are equally circular when Congress --",
  "It says authorized, and there are two factors there to consider. One, that the courts of appeals had uniformly held that it's authorized. And two -- and so Congress incorporated that understanding under accepted principles of statutory construction. And also we know from the legislative history for those on the Court that are interested in looking at it that Congress did intend to incorporate that understanding.",
  "No. I think it means is authorized, but I think that Congress understood -- Congress ratified the understanding of what was authorized, so what was authorized became what is authorized, and --",
  "-- and they're not divisible --",
  "Yes. I am completely arguing that.",
  "In fact, we know from the statute --",
  "We know from the statute that it didn't intend to subtract anything. In the Findings section which it put in as part of the Act, it said that it wanted to provide additional remedies. In (a)(1), it said that the new relief was in addition to the relief as authorized, and it excluded the relief that's authorized from the new relief, and that's because the whole -- what was going on is Congress wanted to provide added relief in the forms of compensatory and punitive damages. It knew that that relief would be subject to a jury determination, and there were Members of Congress and the Administration that was worried that those new damages, subject to jury awards, might be excessive, and so they wanted to cap the new relief, but there was no concern about existing relief. Nothing had been expressed that there was excessive relief then, and Congress had no desire to touch existing relief at all. It wanted to leave it alone, add something new, limit what was new. And it was correct -- the courts of appeals were correct that front pay was authorized under 706(g), because it's discretionary relief of the same character as back pay and reinstatement. And like back pay --",
  "It's no closer to traditional damages than back pay. In fact, less close, because damages are traditionally retrospective. Also --",
  "Well --",
  "No, Your Honor. Under the current rule of a breach of contract, you could, but interestingly enough, if one's looking back for law versus equity and analyze back to the 18th Century, the rule then was that you couldn't get future lost wages as damages for a breach of contract because they were too speculative, so you couldn't get them at law, you couldn't get them in equity then. Congress provided for new remedies of the type that don't have a precise parallel to what was traditionally available at law and equity.",
  "Yes, it does, Your Honor, but it also mentions back pay as an illustration in a statute that allows the court to order such affirmative action, including reinstatement and in a statute that also allows it to award other equitable relief.",
  "Yes, Your Honor. But --",
  "There's never been a question that the back pay under title VII is equitable relief. This Court has repeatedly characterized it as equitable relief, in the Albemarle case, in the Burke case. In Curtis v. Lothar, it took care to say that Title VII's back pay is equitable relief. And, in fact, back pay -- the courts refer to back pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act as equitable relief.",
  "No, Your Honor.",
  "No, Your Honor. Although Congress's characterization of the relief, the Court has indicated, does count for something, but --",
  "Back pay is a matter for the court. There's no right to a jury trial on back pay, just as front pay is a matter for the court and there's no right to a jury trial on front pay.",
  "To the extent that juries might in some cases do back pay, which I'm not specifically aware of, I would assume that they're doing that in an advisory capacity, which the court is allowed to ask the jury to do.",
  "Yes, Your Honor. I think that the back pay and front pay under Title VII are both restitutionary in nature and intertwined with other injunctive relief, and therefore, they are equitable remedies. It's restitutionary in nature, because they both put the -- they require the employer to pay the employee the wages that the employer would have paid the employee if there had been no discrimination.",
  "Damages would apply even in a tort case where the --",
  "Yes. It's true in that case, but the additional features that are here are that it's discretionary with the court. It's not automatically available. It's not available --",
  "Well, Your Honor suggested in your concurring opinion in Albemarle Paper that the discretionary nature was relevant to the question of whether it's equitable relief or whether it's legal relief, and we would agree with that. Discretion is a hallmark of equity, as this Court has repeatedly noted.",
  "That it said other relief, but it excluded all relief authorized under 706(g), not just equitable relief.",
  "It is true that in (b)(2), Congress did not limit the relief that's excluded to equitable relief, and if you think that 706(g) authorizes more than -- relief that's more than equitable relief, then, yes, that would be true, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case arises out of an explosion that killed four employees on a drilling barge on the inland waters of Louisiana. The barge is not inspected for certification by the Coast Guard, which therefore has almost no regulations that address occupational safety and health on the barge. The question presented is whether the Coast Guard has, nonetheless, exercised authority over the working conditions on the barge so as to displace application of the Occupational Safety and Health Act.",
  "Not -- not that apply to this vessel, Your Honor. The -- the only occupational -- the only regulations addressed to occupational safety and health issues on this barge that have been identified by respondent and its amici are regulations that address risk from the marine sanitation devices, or the toilets, on the vessel. The only other regulation of which I'm aware that deals with occupational safety and health is a regulation that -- that addresses operating the vessel while intoxicated. Those regulations -- there are regulations that address emergency procedures on inspected vessels, but not on this type of uninspected vessel.",
  "No, no. There are no fire and safety regulations on -- on this vessel, Your Honor. There are some specific fire and safety regulations required by some statutes on particular types of vessels, particularly vessels propelled by machinery. Those are the ones covered by -- by 46 U.S.C. 4102.",
  "No, Your Honor, but -- but with respect to -- to this vessel, as I -- as I was saying, they don't have such regulations. The -- the containment approach would -- would qualify, although if -- if a regulation was addressed to preventing a fire for occurring, that would address a -- a different -- a different hazard than a regulation that was addressed to responding to that after the fire had occurred and -- and could be put out. But -- but here, the Coast Guard has not exercised statutory authority over the working conditions involved in this case, and under section 4(b)(1) of the act, the --",
  "Yes. Yes, Your Honor. First, to -- to start at the -- the beginning of your question, there are certain categories of vessels that are listed under the statute as inspected vessels and with respect -- under Coast Guard statutes as inspected vessels. On those vessels, the Coast Guard inspects them at the beginning and then periodically for certification that they're in satisfactory condition, fit for the service for which they're intended and seaworthy. The Coast Guard also has comprehensive regulatory authority over those vessels, and it's exercised that authority comprehensively over those vessels. So, for those vessels, the Secretary and the Coast Guard agree the -­ the Occupational Safety and Health Act doesn't apply. Then there's another set of vessels -­",
  "It's completely displaced on the inspected vessels because the Coast Guard has comprehensive authority over those and has exercised its comprehensive authority on the inspected vessels by promulgating comprehensive regulations, and those regulations include specific ones addressing specific hazards, as well as general provisions such as the one that I was referring to that requires that the vessels be fit for the service that they're intended and safe and seaworthy. And therefore, with respect to those, all the working conditions are covered either by the specifics or by the general, and the OSH Act does not apply. But what we're concerned with in this case is a -- is a vessel on which -- over which the Coast Guard has much more limited authority and with respect to which it -- it has authority to and has regulated only very specific conditions.",
  "Not with respect to regulation in terms of setting occupational safety and health standards and enforcing occupational safety and health standards. There is, with respect to reporting or investigation on inspected vessels -- I mean, not -- no. I guess the answer is no.",
  "To get back to the uninspected vessels that -- that Justice Ginsburg had asked about and which is what we -- we have in this case, on those vessels, there's very limited authority. It flows from specific statutory grants that deal with specific items of safety. And therefore, the Coast Guard regulation of working conditions on those vessels is spotty, depending on the statutory grants of authority. And as I said before, on -- this particular type of inspected vessel is a -- is an inland drilling barge, and on this barge there -- the statutory authority doesn't give the Coast Guard authority to require fire extinguishers or -- or those kind of things, and it gives the Coast Guard no authority over the hazards from oil and gas drilling, which are the hazards involved in this -- in this case.",
  "Some uninspected are more closely watched, and we -- we would submit that no uninspected vessel is comprehensively watched as to occupational safety and health. But that -- the Court doesn't need to -- to get into that to -- to resolve this case. All -- all we're asking here is that the Court reject the holding of the Fifth Circuit, which is that there's an industry-wide exemption for all seamen on all vessels from the Occupational Safety and Health Act, even in situations where the Coast Guard has not regulated the particular working conditions on that vessel and the particular working conditions that result in the occupational and safety and health citation in the -- in that case.",
  "Well, there are different types of -- of uninspected vessels, and the -- depending on the type, different sets of regulations apply to them. And the vessel operators are well aware of what regulations apply to them. But -- but on all uninspected vessels, it doesn't really matter whether it's little or more, because the way the statutory scheme works is that the Coast Guard regulations that govern them apply to them. And the OSHA standards apply to the extent that the working conditions are not covered by Coast Guard regulations. And that comes from the -- the language of section 4(b)(1) of the OSH Act, which makes clear that displacement of the act is limited to those working conditions with respect to which other agencies exercise authority to prescribe or enforce occupational safety and health standards. That -­",
  "The Government's view is that you don't look to see if there's precisely the same regulation in precisely the same manner of the same -- the same degree of stringency. You look to see whether the -­ whether there is a regulation on the part of the Coast Guard that addresses the same working conditions, the same hazards that are involved. And if there are, then no matter whether that's more stringent, less stringent, or goes about it in a different way, it's displaced. But here there's no regulation that addresses this hazard -­",
  "Yes, they agree. And the agencies, not only the Coast Guard and OSHA, but other agencies where this comes up, are -- have been in agreement. These kinds of disputes about coverage haven't arisen because the agencies have been disputing about what -- when it applies and when it doesn't and what working conditions are covered by their different regulations. They've arisen when employers have asserted that the OSH Act doesn't apply so that nobody -- there would be no regulations covering -­",
  "Well, we didn't -- we didn't need to resolve any dispute because there's been a longstanding understanding between the two agencies, based on the language of the OSH Act, as to how the -- how the two -­ the authority of each agency interacts with the other.",
  "Yes. Yes, Your Honor. It's the same -­",
  "My answer was intended to say the same thing, that at bottom, the same test applies whether the particular working conditions have been addressed, but with respect to inspected vessels, the working conditions have been addressed comprehensively by the Coast Guard through specific regulations and through general regulations. And so, there aren't -- there aren't any gaps where workers would be unprotected that the OSH Act would need to -- to step in. But on uninspected vessels, the -- the situation is quite -- quite the reverse and almost the polar opposite where there aren't just little gaps, but there are potentially whole vessels that are almost completely unregulated with respect to occupational safety and health. So, the industry-wide exemption that the Fifth Circuit has crafted here would, as a result, leave many workers unprotected from many hazardous conditions and -­ and really frustrate the express purpose of the act which is to assure, insofar as possible that every working man and woman in the Nation has safe and healthful working conditions. And moreover, to -- even if there was any ambiguity about how the statutory scheme should work, from looking at its text and from looking at the -- and from the fundamental purpose of the act, the Secretary has interpreted the act this way for 30 years. It's been the Secretary's longstanding and consisted view. It's reflected in citations over those 30 years and regulations that the Secretary promulgated in 1972 in a statutorily mandated report to Congress on coordination between the OSH Act and other laws that the Secretary submitted in 1980. And the Secretary's view would be -- would be entitled to deference.",
  "It was published in the -- in the Federal Register at -- at the time that it was -- it was entered into, Your Honor. To -- to -- without -- without belaboring the point, turning to the facts that are here briefly, the respondent does not dispute that the Coast Guard hasn't addressed the particular hazards involved here. And as I said before, the only regulations that respondent and amici have -- have pointed to that address the working conditions here are -- are very limited, those addressing the marine sanitation devices, and there is in fact almost no regulation here, so that under any understanding of the term working conditions, any reasonable understanding of what working conditions is under the statute, the Coast Guard hasn't exercised authority over the working conditions here.",
  "That's -- that's one -- one reason. If -- if the area view was interpreted broadly, it would, in effect, completely eviscerate -­",
  "-- the act because it would mean that the regulations of the toilets preempt the -- any regulation of the vessel and expose all those -- all the hazards that might exist on the vessel would not be subject to -- to regulation. So, it has been interpreted narrowly.",
  "Well, I -- I think that -- that there is the potential for -- for different results to arise between the two views, even with the -- the narrow interpretation of -- of the area view because the area is identified, say, as the -- the atmosphere on the boat. The atmosphere might be regulated by the Coast Guard with respect to particular injuries that -- that might be caused by problems in the atmosphere like explosion, which it isn't here, but assume that it were. Yet, it wouldn't be regulated for -- for other problems that might result from that like respiratory problems, particles that would be in the atmosphere that would get into the -- the workers' lungs.",
  "No, Your Honor. Not that it -­ that it has to be an exact duplicate, but that it has to address the same injury, the same kind of injury from the same source in essence.",
  "Yes, if -- if the Coast Guard's regulation didn't address the injury -- the particular injury that would result from the smoke, that the -- that the OSHA regulation was trying to --",
  "-- to get at.",
  "If the Coast Guard had made that determination and expressly concluded that a regulation of that was not warranted, then that would be an exercise of its authority over -- over that working condition and the OSH Act would be displaced. But there's no -- no contention that -- that that is what happened here, and there couldn't be because the Coast Guard doesn't even have authority to regulate the hazards that are involved -- involved here, Your Honor. If there are no further questions, I'll reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.",
  "With the exception of part 160, which doesn't regulate occupational safety and health, none of the regulations identified by respondent applied to the Mr. Belden as is explained in the -- in the appendix in our reply brief. Just to -- just to briefly mention part 26, which he started about the emergency checkoff list, that specifically applies to small passenger vessels based on specific authority given to the Coast Guard to regulate small passenger vessels in more detail. Many of the others deal with navigational issues like running lights, have nothing to do with regulation of occupational safety and health. None regulates the hazards from oil and gas drilling. Section 14 U.S.C. 2 on which respondent relies, first of all, as Justice Ginsburg points out, that only goes to the existence of authority, not to the exercise of it, and the statute is very clear that -- that the other agency must exercise authority to displace the OSH Act.",
  "The Coast Guard has -- has responsibility for investigating marine accidents. Investigative authority doesn't necessarily imply that you have regulatory authority as the National Transportation Safety Board is an illustration of. Congress wanted the Coast Guard to -- to investigate. It does. If it finds violations, finds situations that indicate violations of other agency laws, it coordinates with those agencies, as it did here, and those agencies take appropriate enforcement action. The authority to investigate accidents after they happen, even if they might have been caused by unsafe working conditions, is not regulation of those working conditions, and it doesn't preempt the -­ preempt the OSH Act.",
  "The -- the question of who has authority here is governed by section 4(b)(1) of the OSH Act, not by some agreement between the -- Coast Guard and OSHA. That agreement reflects the Coast Guard's regulations and the interpretation of the OSH Act that the Secretary -­",
  "None whatsoever, Your Honor. We rely -- we rely on the text of -- of section 4(b)(1) which is -- is quite clear that it displaces the OSH Act with respect to particular working conditions. That's in stark contrast to the Fifth Circuit's holding here that there's an industry-wide exemption for all seamen on all vessels from the OSH Act. That's the approach that respondent endorses, admitting that regulation of the toilets would preempt regulation of the act altogether, and that you don't even need to regulate that, that -- that the OSH Act simply doesn't apply because respondent mistakenly believes that the Coast Guard has authority, plenary authority, under section 2, when the Coast Guard has never interpreted section 2 to give it plenary authority. And it's repeatedly gone back to Congress to get specific authority to address specific issues on particular uninspected vessels, and Congress has given the Coast Guard that authority, which indicates that neither Congress nor the Coast Guard thought section 2 gave it that authority. The -- the Secretary's view that the Coast Guard has to regulate the particular working conditions at issue in order to displace the OSH Act is supported by the text. It's supported by the purpose of the act. It's been the Secretary's longstanding view. It's been followed by all the other circuits except for the Fifth Circuit. The Second Circuit, the Ninth Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit, with due respect to the maritime expertise in the Fifth Circuit, those circuits also have a great deal of maritime -- of maritime expertise. And the working conditions here, as Justice Kennedy pointed out, are not maritime-specific. They're matters over which OSHA has expertise, and 4(b)(1) allows the Coast Guard to step in and displace the OSH Act when it has authority and when it believes that its expertise warrants it to address the particular working conditions that are at issue. The Coast Guard doesn't have authority here. It hasn't exercised authority here, and the OSH Act applies here.",
  "Yes. A drilling vessel that went to the Outer Continental Shelf, in most cases, would be an inspected mobile oil drilling unit, which the Coast Guard has comprehensive regulations covering. The Coast Guard also has regulations specifically addressed to all facilities at the Outer Continental Shelf which include a general duty clause, similar to the OSHA general duty clause, that requires that work places there be free of -­ of recognized hazards. In addition, the Interior Department has some regulatory authority out there specifically related to mineral drilling.",
  "The -- it -- it could have if it -- if it hadn't exercised its comprehensive authority over those vessels, but it has exercised its comprehensive authority over those vessels, in contrast to the situation here. If there are no further questions.",

  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioners' only takings claim before the court of appeals and his only -- their only takings claim before this Court is a facial per se claim. That means that their contention is that the mere enactment of the temporary moratorium in this case effected a taking with respect to every parcel to which it applied -- that's the facial aspect -- without any consideration of the reasons for the moratorium. That's the per se aspect. And what is more, that bold claim is limited at this point to the temporary moratorium in effect from August '81 until April 1984.",
  "In 10 --",
  "On the facial aspect I think so, Your Honor. I think doing the Penn Central analysis and not the Lucas analysis, so long as it's not a permanent deprivation abuse. Now, certainly a 10-year claim would have a much harder row to hoe against a takings challenge, but I would like to know the impact on the property's value, why the 10 years was necessary, if it was, the sorts of things that are factored under Penn Central.",
  "This Court said Lucas applied only in the rare circumstance, a total ban on economic reproductive use.",
  "That --",
  "Oh, no. If the Government condemns a leasehold, that's a taking, and compensation is due.",
  "No.",
  "No. You don't sever up the property interest and -- so that it corresponds to the extent of the regulation and then say --",
  "Well, the right at issue here is the right to build residences, to develop the property.",
  "It would first of all be under the Penn Central analysis, and the economic impact --",
  "No, but the other -- the distinction is the one this Court talked about in Loretto, between -- you mentioned the World War II condemnation cases. The Pee Wee Coal case, the Government came in and occupied the coal mine to prevent a strike. That was a taking. In Central Eureka they said, you cannot use the gold mine, and this Court said, that's different, that's not a taking. That's the type of distinction that we're talking about here between physical appropriation or, extended to Lucas, a ban on total economic use, and the temporary regulation that's at issue here. Because the regulation is temporary, the land retains economic value.",
  "Because you're starting out with a property -- presumably the regulation applies to the property generally, and it just so happens that this one parcel has been severed out into a leasehold, and in doing that, that is a question that has to be addressed before you get to the analysis, should you sever out the affected property interest to a leasehold.",
  "But if -- if this Court is -- in its past takings cases, when it's been presented with a regulation that applies to a discrete property interest, it hasn't said, well, let's redefine the effective property interests to that. It didn't do it in Penn Central, it didn't do it in Keystone Bituminous, and it didn't do it in the construction laborers case. The way the property was held by the petitioners in this case is fee simple. This regulation applied to fee simple property. It did not affect the value anywhere near the extent that the regulation in Lucas did.",
  "No, I'm not sure it's no recovery, but I am sure that it's still evaluated under Penn Central, because --",
  "Well --",
  "Well, presumably the impact of regulation would be something that would be addressed in the lease agreement itself.",
  "I mean, if they were leasing it to build a mobile home and it turns out they can't, who bears the responsibility for that, again a matter between the lessor and the lessee. The important point is that the, what the petitioners are arguing for is an extension of the Lucas rule which applied in a, as the Court said, the rare circumstance in which all economic use is prohibited, and the Court emphasized in Lucas that that had the consequence of rendering the property valueless. This is how the Court phrased the question presented in Lucas, whether the act's dramatic effect on the economic value of Lucas' lot accomplished a taking. Well, here, there is no dramatic effect on the economic value of the affected lots, because we're talking about temporary regulation for a limited time.",
  "First, Your Honor, my understanding of the record is quite different from my brother's. If you look at the pretrial order, Exhibit A, pretrial order filed July 17, 1998, it describes the situations with respect to each of the properties. Most of them have been sold long ago. Of those that are not sold, two-thirds have a score that makes them buildable under the '87 plan, so two-thirds of the petitioners who still own property can build on those lots according to the record in this case, and that is just petitioners' allegations.",
  "Sold typically to the Government buy-out agencies, I wouldn't say at a bargain price.",
  "Well --",
  "That's not, of course, what we're talking about here. What we're talking about here is a time-out for a limited period while the agency carries out its responsibility to determine what can be done with the land.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, the first thing I'd say is, you bring an as-applied claim and not a facial claim. The facial claim is the mere enactment of this temporary moratorium effective taking. Well then, don't talk to me about what happened 15 years later, if the mere enactment of the temporary moratorium is your complaint. That's a different case, and he brought that case, and it was thrown out because it was too late. There were challenges brought to the '84 plan, there were challenges brought to the '87 plan. Those challenges failed, and now the effort is to link those challenges up to what's left, the little tail on the dog of this temporary moratorium that started the process.",
  "If the as-applied challenge is to the temporary moratorium?",
  "Well, you go through the Penn Central factors, and if it's taking too long, that's certainly something pertinent on the character of the Government action. That's what other courts have looked to.",
  "And that's one of those things that they would have to show. Here, of course, the district court found that the planning effort was undertaken as speedily as possible.",
  "No. You have to go through the other factors. This is not a per se analysis.",
  "The other factors include the impact on the property. You're claiming a taking. What was the effect on your property?",
  "Well, even the court of appeals recognized that the moratorium is long enough so that the present value of the uses that might be allowed is de minimis, then perhaps the categorical rule would apply, and 10 years seems like it's going to be too long for the Government to figure out and carry out its responsibilities and planning, but I wouldn't say that we try to find a point in time at which suddenly we shift from the accepted Penn Central analysis to the Lucas per se analysis.",
  "I guess what I'm saying is at some point calling something a temporary moratorium is a misuse of the label. If it's 30 years, that's too long. Now, the best that Justice Holmes could do was say that when it goes too far it becomes a taking, and I may not be able to do much better, but the Penn Central factors allow consideration of things like, what is the need for it? The need may not be sufficiently compelling to justify a moratorium of 2 years, or the need may be sufficiently compelling to justify a longer moratorium. What was the impact on your -- the property? Keep in mind, the petitioners submitted no evidence of impact on value. We have no idea from the record what the impact of the temporary moratorium was, other than the evidence that we submitted which shows that properties were sold for significant amounts of value during the period of the temporary moratorium, which makes sense. A temporary ban on development doesn't render property valueless. If you have two parcels of property, one subject to a permanent ban on use, and the other subject to a temporary ban, it is true, as some of the amici say, the permanent ban could be made temporary and the temporary ban could be made permanent, but you're not going to pay the same price for both of those parcels of property. The one that's subject to the temporary ban is going to have a higher market value, reflecting the fact that future uses are available, or will be available or not, depending on the plan that's ultimately adopted.",
  "And that's like the petitioners' effort to link their lost challenges to the permanent land use plan to their challenge to the temporary moratorium.",
  "The district court --",
  "I was just going to say that the district court in this case specifically found that the agency acted in good faith throughout, so the idea that the temporary moratorium to allow planning to take place was some kind of a sham for a permanent --",
  "Only looked at from that period. Only looked at for the 32-month period, and our submission is that that's the improper way to carve up the property interest and say, oh, it's a total taking, because we're going to only look at the property that was taken.",
  "Well, we raised the claim before the court of appeals that one reason there was no taking, even if Lucas applied, was because of the nuisance, et cetera. The Court didn't find it necessary to reach that issue.",
  "That's right, and we appealed that, and the court of appeals didn't find --",
  "That given the impact on the lake of development, that it fell within the California and Nevada nuisance requirements.",
  "Not that it should all be a park, but that further development would threaten the serious and, in fact, irreparable harm to the lake. That's the basis for the Government action in this case that the petitioners have never challenged. But I want to emphasize in concluding that it's important to remember that the issue is not whether a total ban on use for this period effects a taking. The issue is whether a temporary moratorium from August of '81 to April of '84 for the purpose of carrying out the responsibility of undertaking planning with respect to these lots is on its face with respect to every lot that it applied to a per se taking without regard to the reason.",
  "Well, first of all they waited until the '84 plan took effect to file their lawsuit. That suggests to me the gripe was with the permanent ban, not so much the temporary moratorium. Second of all, the supposition in your question makes this not a facial challenge. In other words, it's not the mere enactment. It's because we know what's really going on here. That's an as-applied challenge, that's not a facial challenge, so the landowners in your case said, as, in fact, some have, bring an as-applied challenge saying, as applied to me this is a taking.",
  "I think the period in which the agency's justification is, we need a time-out to undertake planning so that we're not locking the barn door after the horse escapes, should be evaluated separately from the period in which the agency says, this is the land use plan, and if you've got a gripe with us you can challenge that. Those are two separate periods. The character of the Government action is different in those two periods.",
  "Oh, certainly, yes.",
  "Yes. I don't think it's a facial claim, because it depends on more than looking specifically at the face of the ordinance.",
  "And here the --",
  "The district court at petition appendix at page 69 said the agency acted in complete good faith, and completed its responsibilities as quickly as could be expected. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Oh, no. First English didn't address the question of when a temporary regulation can become a taking. It said that if you have a temporary taking, and it assumed arguendo that there was a taking for a temporary period, compensation is required, and we don't dispute that at all.",
  "Well, that's what the California State courts determined on remand when they were addressed with the question.",
  "Oh, no, no, not at all. First English could have been a taking. It would have required an evaluation under, again, Penn Central, not Lucas, to determine whether the regulation at issue there, both the temporary and permanent, and both were at issue at different points in First English, constituted a taking. But once you assume that that was a taking, and you assume the results of that analysis, then it is a taking. Compensation is required.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: ERISA preemption cases can be exceedingly complicated, but our submission this morning is straightforward. This Court held in Pilot Life that ERISA's civil enforcement provisions were the exclusive remedy for improper processing of a claim for benefits under an ERISA-regulated plan. The Illinois independent external review law at issue in this case affords a different remedy for a beneficiary dissatisfied with an HMO's denial of benefits. The Illinois law is therefore preempted. Just last week, in Great West Life, this Court began its analysis by noting that it was especially reluctant to tamper with ERISA's enforcement scheme, and by quoting prior precedent for the proposition that that enforcement scheme indicated that Congress did not intend to authorize other remedies that it forgot to incorporate expressly. That same language, quoted in Great West Life, was quoted 15 years ago in Pilot Life. ERISA's remedies are exclusive, whether we're talking about additional Federal remedies or additional State remedies.",
  "The respondent alleged in the complaint, joint appendix page 32 and 38, that the certificate of coverage was the plan, and that is in the record. It is Exhibit A to the complaint.",
  "The certificate of coverage is an agreement between the HMO and the employer that extends to particular employees the benefits that are set forth there.",
  "I think they're first bound by their allegation, but second of all, even if other documents also contribute terms to the plan, certainly the certificate of coverage indicates elements of the plan. There may be other documents that set forth other terms of the plan.",
  "Well, it's totally wrong because the question is not how the State law operates to grant a new remedy to a beneficiary. We think it's irrelevant whether it operates on the insurance policy or whether it operates on the plan. The point is, however it operates, it provides beneficiaries, under an ERISA-regulated plan, with a new remedy, and that remedy is one that's not granted by Congress in ERISA, and the Court in Pilot Life said only the remedies that are granted are available.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes, and I think the difference is, between mandated benefits laws like Massachusetts, those laws provide, as this Court said in UNUM, a rule of decision that is to be applied by whoever the decision- maker is in reviewing a denial of benefits. Here, it's not a new rule of decision, it's a new decision-maker, and that decision-maker isn't looking to State law to say, well, they've given you mental health coverage and so that has to be provided, he's deciding what -- whether the denial of benefits was proper or not, and that can only be characterized as a remedy, whether it's --",
  "We don't think that's a correct characterization. There is no element of a treatment component in this decision. The only thing that is at issue in this independent external review is coverage, for a number of reasons. First of all, the treatment had already taken place. There was no question of treatment. But coverage is all that Rush HMO has undertaken to provide. It does not provide health care. It doesn't provide -- it agrees to pay for health care.",
  "Well, I -- with respect, I think the facts do place this in a very clear category, because there's no question of treatment at issue. Even if the State is purporting to articulate its definition of medical necessity, that's not the question. The question is, is this beneficiary entitled to benefits under this plan, and the judgment about what is medically necessary is something that is addressed in the plan. The plan provides the broadest possible discretion to the HMO to interpret the plan terms, including medical necessity.",
  "Well, the State law can define medical necessity. I think that's just like a mandated benefit, saying you have to --",
  "That it cannot do consistent with Pilot Life, because that is a remedy for a denial of benefits, and Pilot Life indicated --",
  "Well, that's --",
  "And I think, as Judge Posner pointed out in his dissent, if you do that, then all bets are off. If you say that this is incorporated by State law into your plan, and so when you enforce that remedy, all you're doing is enforcing a term of the plan --",
  "Well, now that was the specific question addressed in Pilot Life. That was -- the heavy lifting in the Pilot Life opinion was reconciling the exclusivity of the civil remedies and the Saving Clause. You can look at it one of two ways. If you give the Savings Clause full force, then the remedies aren't going to be exclusive in a case involving an insurer. If you give the exclusivity of ERISA's remedies full force, then the Savings Clause is relegated to a lower status, and --",
  "UNUM did not involve a remedy. It said, the question under Pilot Life and 502 was, quote, not implicated, because it wasn't a State remedy that they were trying to save under the insurance Savings Clause. It was a rule of decision. This is not a rule of decision. It's a different decision-maker, and if this type of State law remedy is allowed, then there's nothing left --",
  "The law --",
  "I think that's correct. I -- the line is not -- and this is what UNUM taught. The line is not between substance and procedure when you're talking about mandated coverage. That's not the line we're advocating. The line we're advocating is between mandated coverage, what does term, what does the plan have to provide, and UNUM said, one thing it has to provide, whatever the coverage is, coverage for those claims that are filed in a timely manner, or, if not, that did not prejudice the insurer. This is different. This is not a new term of coverage. It's a remedy. If you don't like what the HMO has done with your benefits claim, you get to go to a State law, independent external reviewer, and get it overturned, and --",
  "It --",
  "The argument is made that this is okay because all you get are the benefits that you're entitled to under the plan. We think that the Taylor decision, decided the same day as Pilot Life, rejects that argument. It says that one of the claims in that case was for the benefits due under the plan, not punitive damages, not emotional distress, the plan benefits, and the Court said, that's not only preemptive, that's completely preemptive. ERISA preempts not only different remedies, but alternative, additional remedies.",
  "No. I think that's certainly an open question. The issue there would be --",
  "Arbitration -- it's the difference between a voluntary agreement between parties, which is what ERISA seeks to enforce, and something that's compelled by State law. The analogy that the Solicitor General draws to the collective bargaining --",
  "Well, it would survive because it would be regarded as an internal plan procedure, not --",
  "No. No. I mean, the -- ERISA allows internal remedies, appeals within the plan, and again it's an open question, but we don't dispute that the arbitration would be allowed. The problem with the analogy to the arbitration cases is that the Solicitor General stops too early. Yes, you can have voluntary arbitration, even where remedies are preempted, but surely a State law that directed that parties to a collective bargaining agreement must arbitrate, and here's how they must arbitrate, would be preempted by the Labor Management Relations Act. If you pursue the analogy to a situation that's comparable to this case, the conclusion that there's preemption seems to follow inexorably, and the idea that everything is all right because at the end of the day you have to enforce this in a section 502 action really makes a hollow shell out of Pilot Life. You have to sometimes enforce arbitration in court, but we still think of arbitration as a different remedy. We don't say, that's a judicial remedy because it has to be enforced.",
  "And we actually go on to the third game which is, if it conflicts with the substantive term of ERISA, and this is what Pilot Life held, it is preempted, and this conflicts with the exclusivity of the remedies. We don't believe, when you go through the usual insurance Savings Clause factors, that this is the regulation of insurance, but what Pilot Life held, and this was the important part of the decision, which was unanimous, is that when you look at the Savings Clause you have to be informed by an understanding of what Congress was trying to do with the exclusive remedies, that the most important -- quote, most important consideration in deciding whether that remedy in that case is covered by the Savings Clause was that Congress said that all the remedies were exclusive. If you allow them back into this back door of the Savings Clause, then that exclusivity is going to be completely undermined. That's the issue that's here before the Court.",
  "And again, that poses sort of a conflict between what the Court in Pilot Life said were the exclusive remedies and the Savings Clause. That is what this Court unanimously decided 15 years ago in Pilot Life when it said, when we look at the Savings Clause, the most important thing -- most important thing -- is to keep in mind the remedies are supposed to be exclusive, so that if this is a remedy, it is a regulation of ERISA, it is not the regulation of insurance, and the Court reaffirmed that approach in the John Hancock case where it said, and I'll just quote one sentence, no decision of this Court has applied the Savings Clause to supersede the provision in ERISA itself. If you apply the Savings Clause to allow this State law remedy to be applied, that would be superseding what this Court said section 502 of ERISA meant in Pilot Life, which was that these remedies are exclusive. That question was addressed. That was -- and I'll say it again, that was the hard part of the opinion in Pilot Life, and that was reaffirmed in John Hancock, and --",
  "Well, I do think it's particularly bad, but I don't think it has to be. I think if the State law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the Federal objectives, it is preempted. The Federal objective requires exclusivity with respect to remedies. This obviously stands as an obstacle to that objective and so is preempted. Now, they say it's saved because the last stop in this State law remedy is a quick dash into Federal court to get a stamp that says, enforce. The State law says, if the reviewer says you've got to provide this, the HMO has to provide it, and they say, well, that's okay, because we run into Federal court, we make this a 502 action. Well, that makes Pilot Life ridiculous, because it says every type of remedy is okay so long as the last stop is a quick visit to the Federal courthouse. It also raises very serious Article III concerns, because Federal courts are not supposed to be looking at decisions made by -- made under State law that they have no authority to review and simply rubber-stamping them, and it gives rise to the bizarre results that the respondent and the Solicitor General support in this case that an action to enforce section 4-10 is completely preempted so that there's jurisdiction, but then it turns out section 4-10 is not preempted at all. That's a very curious result, but they have to maintain --",
  "4-10 is the State law, of the Illinois HMO act. I've been referring to it as the independent external review law. But they have to maintain that facade.",
  "What is absurd is that they have to maintain that this can only be enforced under a 502 action, that the State law claim -- keep in mind this began, of course, as a State law claim in State court. 502 wasn't mentioned at all. It was recharacterized as a 502 action, they said because it's completely preempted, but the underlying remedy that's being enforced isn't preempted at all. Now, those are two different questions, jurisdiction and substance, but it does seem odd that if you're going in and all you're doing is getting a rubber stamp from the Federal courthouse saying, enforced, that that's completely preempted, when the law isn't preempted at all.",
  "Well, that's because there's a different decision-maker making the decision on your claim for the denial of benefits, and that's what makes it clear that what's involved is a different remedy. It's also a remedy that changes dramatically what the plan actually provides, and it does that by taking away from the plan fiduciary the deference that the fiduciary --",
  "I'm sorry, the --",
  "No. The only elements of the plan that are in the record is the certificate of coverage, which --",
  "Well, that's what the law provides.",
  "No, because the elements of the plan that are in the record, the certificate of coverage, notes that the HMO has the broadest possible discretion to interpret the terms of the plan in deciding coverage and, under this Court's decision in Firestone --",
  "Yes, and -- pages 7 and pages 8. It's Exhibit A to the complaint -- and under this Court's decision in Firestone, that means that that decision is subject to a deferential review. The State law changes that, and the State law gives the decision to the independent external reviewer, who makes his decision apparently de novo, so that the precise thing that the plan participants, parties contracted against, the recognition that this medical necessity is a question of judgment, some people are going to view it differently, we want to make clear that it's our discretion that controls, and that gives us entitlement to deferential review --",
  "Yes.",
  "My understanding of many of the pending bills is that they have an external review provision but, of course, it's a Federal one, and that is consistent with ERISA's goal of uniformity in claims processing and administration.",
  "No.",
  "Other than at various times passage is imminent, and then it falls apart, but again it's a very different thing to say, this is the uniform Federal remedy, and to have, as Your Honor points out, 40 different remedies, if you're running a company that has a health care plan with operations in different States, the health plan can't be uniformly --",
  "They all have differences. For example, in some States the independent external reviewer is an administrative board. In Michigan, it consists of seven people in certain places. In some places it's not just one person, it's more than one person. Some places it consists of employee representatives as well as physicians, but it does change what the parties contracted for, and --",
  "Well, I don't know that it's more disturbing. It's different, yes. The impact on an HMO can be greater if the State law says, you must provide mental health coverage, this, this, and this, but then at least the employer looking at it knows what's at stake, and he knows that the remedy is going to be the remedy that is provided under Federal law, which is that they're going to enforce what I have agreed to provide under this plan, even if what I've agreed to provide is compelled by State law. You know that you're not going to face all sorts of different remedies and in particular, here, if you contract for the broadest possible discretion, you know that when the review is undertaken your fiduciary decision will be reviewed with appropriate deference. That is taken away here. It's taken away by giving the independent external reviewer the authority to make a de novo decision, so that what is set up are two very different remediary regimes. The Federal regime, the fiduciary makes a decision with the broadest possible discretion. His obligation is to be faithful to the terms of the plan. That is reviewed in Federal court.",
  "Or someone to whom that discretion has been delegated under ERISA, and there's a provision in ERISA that allows them to say, this is the entity that is going to make the final decision. Under 503, that is a fiduciary decision, the final denial or grant of benefits. That's the Federal remedy. The State remedy is, the independent external reviewer makes his or her decision, and that decision is binding and final. Those are two very different remedies, ERISA's remedies are supposed to be exclusive, and the decision below undermining that exclusivity should be reversed.",

  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. My friend Mr. Kneedler again drew the analogy to the Labor Management Relations Act, and we are on common ground. That's a good analogy. He again stopped one step short. A State law that compelled the parties to a collective bargaining agreement to resolve their disputes in a particular manner, even arbitration, would surely be preempted under the Labor Management Relations Act and, to the extent this remedy is similar to arbitration, that same conclusion applies. We heard that there's no interference with 502 because beneficiaries have the option. They can use the Federal remedy, or they can use the State remedy. The existence of an alternative remedy is, in fact, an interference with section 502, and that test is that option with the beneficiary is peculiarly inappropriate when you're talking about preemption. Preemption often is the result of a quid pro quo. We're going to give, say, employees a Federal remedy, but for the employers we're going to make it exclusive. To say that additional remedies are okay so long as the employee can still resort to the Federal remedy seems to ignore the typical dynamic of preemption. And as far as the arbitration analogy goes, the fact that the plans may or may not be able to voluntarily adopt such a remedy doesn't mean the State can compel it. Nothing prevented the plan in Egelhoff from voluntarily opting the beneficiary designation rule at issue there. that didn't keep this Court from ruling that it was preempted. Nothing preempted the plan in Greater Washington Board of Trade from saying, we're going to provide the same level of benefit to people on Worker's Comp as to others, and yet a rule mandating that was preempted. We're dealing here with a compelled alternative State law remedy that changes completely the standard of review available under the Federal remedy. It's not surprising the results under the two remedies came out differently. That additional remedy is preempted. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. Stockbrokers like the respondent are the critical link between the National Securities Markets and individual investors who trust brokers to buy and sell securities for their benefit. Respondent betrayed that trust by selling his customers' securities not for their benefit, but for a secret purpose of misappropriating the proceeds and by embezzling the proceeds as he had planned. In so doing, Respondent violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. Those provisions prohibit the use of fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. Respondent --",
  "That embezzlement would not be in connection with the prior sale under the theory that we are asking the Court to adopt here. But the SEC believes that it would be a violation of 10(b) under a different theory which isn't a necessary consequence of the one --",
  "You don't have to agree with that to find a violation here.",
  "They involve both situations, Your Honor.",
  "Both situations.",
  "I am not aware that they routinely audit the brokers. The NASD does do that and then refers matters to the SEC and consults with the SEC. The SEC also would respond to complaints that they got or take investigations if they had reason to believe it was called to their attention.",
  "They could request a prosecution, Your Honor, but it's important that the SEC is the federal agency that's charged with maintaining the integrity of the markets and investor confidence in the markets, have direct authority to prevent and to pursue the kind of fraud that's involved here which is very -- potentially very unsettling to the markets. Because since most transactions are made through brokers, if customers and investors can't trust their brokers to be executing their transactions for the customer's benefit rather than for the broker's benefits, the markets can't function effectively.",
  "That goes back to the question that Justice Scalia asked me, Your Honor. And under the theory that we are advocating here, and for the Court to rule for us here, you don't need to conclude that. The SEC does take that position.",
  "That any fraudulent conversion by a broker from a brokerage account is a violation of 10(b) because it's fraud and it's in connection with the purchase or sale of securities; because the very purpose of the brokerage account is to buy and sell securities. And the broker has access to the customer's assets --",
  "-- for the purpose of --",
  "That is beyond any case that I'm aware that you have decided. But here the broker actually converted the securities by means of fraudulent sales. And his deception not only caused the sales, it was material to the sales. And the sales themselves, because they were fraudulent, coincided with and completed the fraud. And that's very much in tune -- that's really controlled by past cases of the Court. For instance in the Bankers Life case, the Court held that corporate fiduciaries violated Section 10(b) when they deceived the corporation into believing that it would receive the proceeds of the securities that the corporation sold.",
  "There wasn't a misrepresentation in Bankers Life about a particular security, there was a misrepresentation that the corporation would receive the proceeds. And there was that same misrepresentation here, Your Honor, only it was by way of an omission or a course of conduct rather than an affirmative statement. Because the customers had entrusted Respondent with the authority to trade on their behalf, with the understanding and the implicit representation that he would trade on their behalf and that they would receive the proceeds of the sales, that they would be used for their benefit in other trades when --",
  "That would have turned it from fraud into theft. It would have also been a breach of his fiduciary duty if he went ahead and they didn't authorize him. But just like in O'Hagan --",
  "It wouldn't have been fraud if there was no deception. It's critical to a 10(b)e violation that there be deception of some kind.",
  "Yes.",
  "In this circumstance, yes, the customer could have brought a private action against the broker, Your Honor. That wouldn't be true in every circumstance because the customer, a private plaintiff seeking damages has to prove elements of a violation in addition to what the SEC must prove. A customer has to show causation of the transaction and loss or damages to the customer. The customer also has to be an actual purchaser seller. In the situation where there's a sale by the broker of the customer's securities, the purchaser-seller requirement will be met. But there might not be the damages that are necessary unless the broker follows through with his scheme to misappropriate the proceeds of the sale.",
  "But he did.",
  "I don't know, Your Honor, why the restitution award in the criminal action was limited to $10,000. But it's clear that Respondent, it's clear from the allegations in the complaint and also from the criminal trial that Respondent did embezzle far more than that amount of the Woods' assets. And that's one of the reasons that it's important for the SEC to be able to pursue this action. Because if it had to rely on the criminal action, then there wouldn't be a full disgorgement of the improper gains by the broker. And there would be far less deterrent to this kind of activity. Of course a criminal prosecution is significant deterrent, but --",
  "It does -- it does comport with our theory, Your Honor. It doesn't in so many words allege the intent at the time. But the factual allegations in the complaint necessarily give rise to that inference. Because, first, one of the allegations is that Respondent issued checks to himself on the mutual fund account and that the cashing of those checks caused the sales. And so when he took the money, he necessarily by writing the checks to himself, he necessarily had the intent at the time. And then there are additional allegations --",
  "In the -- in the mutual fund checks, if you look at Page 28A, of the petition, in paragraph 16 of the complaint, it describes the beginning of the fraudulent scheme in May of 1988, shortly after Mr. Wood was hospitalized as a result of his stroke, and notes that between May and June 1988, Zandford, without the prior knowledge or consent of Wood and Okstulski, issued three checks to himself totaling $41,000. The checks were drawn on a joint mutual fund account held by Wood and Okstulski outside of their Dominick account, and the funds represented therein were obtained through the sale of mutual fund shares --",
  "I think the way that that kind of account works is that it's like a checking account with your mutual funds. You write the check, you write the checks on the account and the redeeming of the check causes the sales of the mutual funds. But regardless of whether it precisely states that, that's certainly a reasonable inference or facts that can be proved based on these allegations which is all that's necessary to get past the dismissal of the complaint, Your Honor. And in addition on the other allegations on the next page and the paragraphs on the next page, there are description of repeated sales and repeated conversions over a long period of time. And, you know, one time maybe he formed the intent after the sales, although that's unlikely given that this happened after the allegations in the previous paragraph. But 13 more times, Your Honor, I think that it's hard to believe.",
  "The recovery goes to the -- to the government, but the SEC has a policy of if there are identifiable victims to endeavor to give the victims those -- those funds and to make them whole if they are available. So here where there are identifiable victims, they would do that.",
  "Well, the restitution, first of all, the purposes of restitution and disgorgement are different in that one is aimed on the -- is focused on the making whole the loss to the -- to the people that are injured, whereas the other is aimed at requiring the wrongdoer to disgorge any benefit that he got from the scheme. But in addition, Your Honor, the statute provides for a civil action and gives the SEC the power to do that in order to further its role in ensuring the integrity of the markets and ensuring investor confidence in the markets. And it empowers the SEC rather than the individual U.S. attorneys to determine when it's necessary to ask for that kind of a remedy in order to further those purposes. And the SEC properly made that determination, made that determination here.",
  "No. Their record I think establishes that they lost everything that they had entrusted to him which was 420 roughly, thousands of dollars' worth.",
  "Yes, that certainly happens, Your Honor. Thank you.",
  "Well, the SEC does its own balancing of what's appropriate to further the interests and it asks for a disgorgement which is an equitable remedy. And the Court takes into account those concerns in deciding whether to award it. And here the District Court did determine that it was appropriate to award disgorgement in the amount of $343,000.",
  "Yes, they do talk to each other. But the decision, Your Honor, whether to bring the prosecution and what to charge and what to ask for is the decision of the prosecutors, whereas the decision of what is appropriate to pursue as a civil action in order to further the purposes of the securities laws is the responsibility of the SEC. And if the two arms don't necessarily agree that that can all be done in a criminal proceeding, then sometimes a civil proceeding is necessary to accomplish the goals and --",
  "Yes, it is.",
  "Um --",
  "Well, in theory, Your Honor, yes. Although here in the Supreme Court the Solicitor General represents the SEC. And in order for the SEC to come here, the Solicitor General has to authorize the action.",
  "Well, again, I'd like to reiterate that to decide this case and under the theory that we are advancing here, you don't need to reach that. But even under the other theory that I alluded to, there are limits to what would be covered. For instance a broker could defraud customers by convincing them to pursue an investment advisory relationship. And that would not be -- that would not necessarily be covered. In addition, the broker might defraud the customers of assets that are outside of the brokerage account and that aren't securities because the broker has developed a relationship of trust with the customer. That wouldn't be covered under the other theory. In addition, the broker, I guess it's a similar thing, the broker could defraud the customer into making some other kind of investments, real estate investments, because of the relationship of trust that had developed. But the SEC has consistently taken the position that with regard to brokerage accounts and the brokerage relationship that involves the purchase or sale of securities and that exists for the purpose of the purchase or sale of securities, that it is a violation when the broker defrauds its customer.",
  "That would still be -- and then he -- they gave him the money and he purchased securities and then sold the securities?",
  "That would still be a violation, Your Honor, because he would have the same fiduciary relationship with them by virtue of them making him their agent for securities transactions and entrusting their assets to him to engage in securities transactions. And when he sold for the secret purpose of misappropriating the proceeds rather than for their benefit, and he did not disclose that he was doing that, he would be deceiving them in connection with the sale of securities, just as Mr. Zandford did here. And that would be a violation under these circumstances. If there are no further questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.",
  "No, Your Honor, we didn't seek review of the reversal of the summary judgment. We sought review of a different part of the Court of Appeals opinion. After it reversed the summary judgment, it explained why it didn't think summary judgment could be granted, it went on to say that the allegations in the complaint didn't state a claim under 10(b). And that's what we want reversed. And the Court of Appeals relied on the facts in Page 8A of the petition. The Court of Appeals states in the part of the opinion that's relevant here that the SEC, I'm in the middle paragraph of that page under the B, and I think it's the third sentence, says it, meaning the SEC, alleges that Zandford defrauded the Woods by failing to inform them that he intended to sell their securities in order to obtain the proceeds for himself. So the facts that the Court of Appeals were considering are precisely the same facts that we are relying on here, Your Honor. And the --",
  "Okay. I was just going say that the indictment is no different in any event, and on Page 41A in paragraph 5 of the indictment it alleged that Charles Zandford caused checks to be issued against the security positions of William R. Wood and Diane Okstulski and made payable to Charles Zandford, thereby causing their securities to be liquidated.",
  "It says it was part of a scheme and artifice to defraud.",
  "So I think that pretty well encompasses that.",
  "Okay. I would point to, on page 36 of our brief we discuss the Southeastern Securities Corporation adjudication, Your Honor, from 1949, seven years after the SEC promulgated Rule 10(b). In that case the facts were that the president and director of the brokerage firm sold the customer's securities without her knowledge or consent and converted the proceeds of the sale to his own use. And after explaining that there was a relationship of trust and confidence and that he had a fiduciary duty, the SEC addressed the argument that this conduct was authorized because he had discretion over the customer's affairs by virtue of a general power of attorney, and rejected that argument, noting that even assuming the power of attorney's validity, it didn't authorize this conduct absent a showing of full and specific disclosure to and understanding consent by the customer. And then the Commission concluded that the stockbroker's taking and sale of the customer's securities and his use of the proceeds constituted a willful abuse of his trust and a violation of --",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. There's a violation at the time of the sale.",
  "The discretionary authority doesn't make the sale authorized because he's authorized only to sell for the benefit of the customers.",
  "Two -- two points to address that concern, Your Honor. First of all, as I was discussing with Justice Ginsburg earlier, when there is -- a private action requires proof of damages. And if the broker doesn't follow through with his plan to convert the proceeds, there will be -- it will be frequently the case that the customer can't show damages and needs to be able to allege those as a required part of the action, couldn't bring it at all, end, case over.",
  "Right.",
  "No, Your Honor. Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, the plaintiff has to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the requisite fraudulent state of mind.",
  "No, Your Honor. Only secret or deceptive breaches of fiduciary duty are frauds.",
  "Many of them, particularly breaches of the duty of loyalty will be secret, Your Honor. But not every breach of fiduciary duty is going to be -- is going to be secret or knowing. A breach of the duty of care wouldn't even be knowing necessarily. A breach of the duty of fairness as in the Santa Fe case where all the factors disclosed would not be deceptive, there would be no violation. But in O'Hagan, the Court explained that when the -- when a fiduciary pretends loyalty to the principal and instead embezzles the principal's property, that's a fraud. And that's a fraud --",
  "This is -- this is just like a standard churning case, Your Honor. A churning case is one --",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, you are not addressing churning because obviously that's not here. But I think that the courts of appeal have unanimously concluded that churning is a violation. And that's because the broker who has control over the account and who's been entrusted with trading authority by the customer is making the trades, not in furtherance of the customer's investment objectives but in furtherance of the broker's aim of gaining commission.",
  "Well, again, Your Honor, churning is -- it's a different -- it's a different factual scenario because there are repeated sales and because the proceeds aren't taken. And I suppose that a distinction could be drawn between when the proceeds are taken and if the proceeds -- if it isn't a question of taking the proceeds but just making a commission, which the customer knows that the broker is doing. But I do think this would be strong precedent in support of those cases.",
  "Not particularly. I was acknowledging that I think this would be strong precedent. But I -- Respondent concedes that churning is covered, the courts of appeals unanimously have held that churning is covered. I have no doubt that churning is covered. The SEC has no doubt that churning is covered. So you wouldn't be breaking -- wouldn't be breaking new ground in holding that. I mean, it would be in the sense that it would be your decision, but you can make the distinctions in future cases that you feel are appropriate and necessary, Your Honor.",
  "If there are no further questions, the Government would ask that the decision of the Court of Appeals be reversed.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioners' claims are barred because they weren't filed within 6 years of when they first accrued, on the enactment of ELIHPA. Petitioners allege that their contracts gave them the option to prepay their mortgages at any time subject to only those legal restrictions in place when the contracts were made. They're, thus, alleging that the Government promised not to impose additional legal restrictions on their option to prepay and ELIHPA itself breached any such promise because ELIHPA itself imposed additional legal restrictions on prepayment. Petitioners' contracts claims accrued at the time of that present breach.",
  "We're -- for --",
  "For the purposes of deciding the statute of limitations question, yes.",
  "Included a right of prepayment and not only a right of prepayment, because if the contract just said you can prepay at any time, it like all contracts would be presumed to be subject to subsequent legislation. So, the -- that right to prepayment had to also include a promise that the Government wouldn't change the rules and impose additional legal restrictions on --",
  "No. In that circumstance, it would be anticipatory repudiation. But -- but here you have legislation, not a statement by a private party.",
  "Well, two things. One, legislation itself alters the legal rights, and two --",
  "No. The Government --",
  "Yes. Yes, Your Honor, and the Government --",
  "-- can breach the contract and -- and be responsible for damages. And we're not arguing that -- that they can't.",
  "No. No, no, Your Honor. The Government --",
  "That doesn't mean -- that -- that doesn't mean that it's not a breach, but what it means is that the breach is occurring at the time the legislation is passed.",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay. What -- what we're -- what we're asking for is that people who believe that their contractual rights have been injured -- have been infringed by a statute give the Government reasonably prompt notice, in accordance with the statute of limitations, of their claims. And the benefit of the ability to have a prompt accounting outweighs, in the Government's view, any additional lawsuits that may result. And we don't think that there will be a significant number of additional lawsuits because, as the Court was explaining before, there's an ability to sue immediately on the anticipatory repudiation theory. So, it isn't that the petitioners -- or that the Government is not going to be subject to suit or --",
  "The -- the damages are that petitioners had a loan that they allege gave them an unfettered option to prepay at any time. And after ELIHPA was passed, that loan no longer had that unfettered option to prepay. And a loan that has an -- has an absolute prepayment option is worth more than a loan with a severely restricted prepayment option. The difference in the value of the loan is reflected in the difference of the value of the property that's encumbered by the loan, and it's -- it's easy to measure by comparing the --",
  "The damages, first of all, can be measured, as I said. Second of all, the -- the Government, as reflected in the statute of limitations, has a -- has a prompt -- has an interest in prompt resolution of the claims.",
  "That -- that's right --",
  "With -- with due respect, Your Honor, I -- I don't think that's the reason why the law gives the -- the option to the innocent party. The law gives the option to the innocent party so that the -- the party has the ability -- the opportunity to convince the defendant to retract its wrongful repudiation.",
  "It's not an option here because the statute is a present breach. And -- and to understand that --",
  "-- it's important to understand the nature of the promise that's -- that's at issue here, I think, and if -- if I could try to go back to -- to do that.",
  "Our position is that there is an actual breach at the time that the statute is passed, and it's a breach of -- of the promise that the Government made that it wouldn't impose additional legal restrictions on prepayment.",
  "It's different from --",
  "Performance on that promise is due, Your Honor. Performance on that promise is -- is due throughout the life of the loan.",
  "No, Your Honor, because -- because the -- the difference is between legislation and the -- and the role that legislation has under background principles of contract law and other actions.",
  "Yes.",
  "The -- the distinction, Your Honor, is that -- is -- is twofold. The legislation changes the legal rights and so there isn't an ability anymore to perform.",
  "It does -- it does exactly that. That's what I mean by changing the legal rights, that it changes -- there's no longer a -- a right to performance. There's only a right to the damages. If it was a contract --",
  "No. No, Your Honor, there might be a right to specific performance if it was the kind of contract that you could specific performance, but we would submit that you couldn't get specific performance once the Government --",
  "-- precluded the performance by law. You could only get damages.",
  "The -- what it does is show that there's -- that there's a change and an -- an injury right at the time that the legislation is passed.",
  "It -- it's not going to apply in a private context because there isn't going to be a breach by virtue of -- of legislation unless there's a promise by the private party that --",
  "-- that the laws aren't going to change.",
  "You -- you have --",
  "You have --",
  "You have no need to invent that. You have no need to -- to have that additional promise in the private contract because -- because there isn't the presumption. There -- there isn't the presumption in that circumstance that the contract is subject to legislation even though the Government is -- has the ability to legislate.",
  "My -- my argument is not that this is an anticipatory breach. The -- our -- our principal submission is that this is a present breach, but -- but it's a present breach of a promise that the Government --",
  "-- that has to be there in a contract with the Government because of the Government's --",
  "That -- that's not our principal submission. We -- but you could read the statute -- you could read the statute that providing first accrues to mean that the first -- that when a plaintiff can first bring suit, that that's when the statute of limitations starts to run --",
  "Yes, given the principles of sovereign immunity and the principle that the statute should be narrowly construed. But -- but --",
  "The Court -- the Court has held several times that statutes of limitations, as conditions on the Government's waiver of its sovereign immunity, should themselves be -- be narrowly construed and has applied it in -- in cases, for instance, involving a situation where a private party claimed that the limitations period didn't run until an administration -- administrative determination had been made that there wouldn't be -- that there was a -- was a loss and --",
  "Yes, the Government --",
  "The Government can do that and has done it here, and the statute of limitations provides that when the action first accrues, there are 6 years to sue. And if -- if --",
  "In the -- in the ordinary situation, if a private party -- let's -- if -- if I may, let's -- can I pose a hypothetical? If -- if a -- if a private party had promised that you could prepay, that the other party could prepay at any time, and Congress passed a statute that imposed restrictions on prepayment, that statute would be neither an anticipatory repudiation or a breach, but would provide a discharge. And -- but if the private party had promised, subsidiary to the promise that it would be prepaid at any time, that there -- that notwithstanding passage of legislation, that if -- if there was legislation passed that -- that -- excuse me -- that the private party had promised that legislation wouldn't be passed or had promised to indemnify, notwithstanding the passage of legislation, then there would be a breach at the time the legislation is passed. And the Government has to make that promise, and petitioners have alleged that the Government made that promise here. That's what -- that's what they lost on the summary judgment motion in the -- in the lower court about on the merits --",
  "Yes. That --",
  "That's an issue, and then there's a separate --",
  "On -- on the merits -- on the merits, yes. But -- but --",
  "Yes.",
  "Okay. It would apply to administrative regulations if -- if that was the -- the issue whether the promise -- if -- if the issue was there wouldn't be regulations -- different regulations that imposed restrictions on prepayment. It would apply to that and it would be breached at the time the regulations were promulgated. They have the effect of law. The authority for that is the -- is the background principle that's -- that's recognized in the Winstar case, that's recognized in Bowen v. Posse, that's recognized in --",
  "Okay. And then to return to the -- to practical considerations that -- that we think argue in our favor on that side, that's because the Government has a prompt interest in -- has a -- has a strong interest in a prompt accounting of the costs of legislative action. And it's particularly important that -- it's -- it's important that, one, that -- that a Congress close to the Congress that enacts a statute be able to address the consequences of the enactment. And it's also important that Congress --",
  "-- be able to cause a --",
  "Yes. Congress can repeal the legislation, but it doesn't change the fact that during the -- the period the legislation was in effect that there's an alteration of legal rights, and there's also, if there was a promise that -- that the -- that the rights wouldn't be changed, a breach during that time. And although Congress did -- although Congress did repeal the statute here, it -- it's far less likely in the ordinary situation that Congress is going to repeal statutes than it is that a private party is going to change its mind about its intention to repudiate a -- a contract, and --",
  "When -- when there's a present -- when there's a breach, the general principle is the statute of limitations starts to run at the time of the breach. It doesn't wait to run until --",
  "There's this -- there's a -- a very strong interest in permitting the Government to -- in permitting Congress to decide it wants to wrap up the costs of improvident Federal contracts that they have --",
  "The -- the Government doesn't know who's going to sue, for one. And so -- so it -- what this rule does is --",
  "Well -- well, it -- there's a dispute here as to whether the contract made this promise or not, and the Government doesn't -- doesn't know how that dispute is going to be resolved. We don't believe that -- that there was a promise that prepayment would not be subject to subsequent legislation.",
  "Well, when they breach a contract and it's a breach, the statute of limits does start to run and the rule is that even if the damages can't be fully ascertained, that -- that the statute of limitations run. And that's true with -- if -- if there was a contract between one party to -- to employ another party for the other party's life and that contract was breached, the statute of limitations would run at the date of breach even though it wouldn't be possible with certainty to know the length of the damages. A -- a contract for a breach of warranty of merchantability --",
  "Even under the scenario you posed that -- that there wasn't an incentive to prepay right at the moment, there's still a -- a change in what -- in -- in the loan that petitioners have, and it's a loan where they no longer have that option to prepay with unfettered --",
  "Yes, Your Honor, but petitioners here aren't complaining about the fact that they're ultimately not able to prepay. They're really complaining about the -- about the restriction in the circumstances under which they prepaid, and -- and that's revealed by their complaint where not all -- even -- petitioners have -- have submitted requests for prepayment. And some of them have accepted incentives with -- and withdrawn their requests. So, if they were complaining about not being able to prepay, they would have gone through the whole ELIHPA process to see whether they -- they could prepay.",
  "Some petitioners have made requests to prepay. Not all petitioners have made requests to prepay.",
  "Some have but not all petitioners.",
  "At that point, there's an exacerbation in our view of the -- of the previous breach because it's an application of the restrictions that were imposed and that were imposed, according to petitioners' allegations, in violation of the Government's promise not to impose them. But --",
  "At the time of the --",
  "I suppose that the Government could -- could do that. I'm not -- I -- you know, I don't know for sure, but I don't know any reason why -- why --",
  "An immediate breach, Your Honor.",
  "It's an immediate breach. Do I have something that -- that says --",
  "No.",
  "Yes. I don't --",
  "I don't think that -- that the case -- I don't have a case one way or the other on that proposition.",
  "But -- but ordinarily --",
  "If you didn't make any -- any other promise at all, it would be an anticipatory breach. I agree with you. But you wouldn't have need to make that other promise because the -- because it would be presumed that you wouldn't take action that would -- you wouldn't be excused by taking action that makes it impossible for you to perform. But -- but that presumption doesn't apply in the case of the Government and legislation because of the --",
  "Well --",
  "All -- all I can say to that, Your Honor, is that -- that there are many situations in which damages cannot be ascertained fully. In fact, there are situations in which courts have confronted situations where the damages can't -- no measurable damages could be found at all at the time of breach, and they hold that it -- it runs from the breach. And the -- the policy arguments on our side are the -- the Government's interest in a prompt accounting, in being able to wrap things up and in not having --",
  "-- to wait for 50 years to know --",
  "I -- I don't think it discourages them, Your Honor, because they -- they can sue and their damages are measurable, and they can get the damages. The likelihood that interest rates are going to go up or that interest rates are going to go down and -- and other possibilities are -- are reflected in the -- in the change in the value of the loans and they're measurable at that time. And -- and if petitioners think they might be able to prepay later, subject to the restrictions, so they wouldn't be injured in that way, they can sue, get their damages and then they'll be subject to the restrictions in the program. And if they prepay and -- and the restrictions don't prevent them in any way from prepaying or don't impose any limitations on them, then they've gotten the damages for what they've lost and they also get the ability to prepay.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1974, when it enacted the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, Congress conditioned Federal funding for educational institutions on the institution not having a policy or practice of releasing student records without consent. Congress did not phrase this condition in terms of individual rights. It did not, for example, follow the model of title IX, enacted 2 years earlier and also dealing with educational institutions, and say something like, no student at a school receiving Federal funds shall have his records released without his consent. Instead, Congress proceeded more indirectly. It said that no funds shall be made available to any institution having a policy or practice of releasing student records without consent. The statute is directed to the Secretary of Education. He's the one who makes Federal funds available, not to the institution receiving the funds, and certainly not to the individual student. This Court's cases establish that that is a distinction that makes a difference. In Cannon, for example, the Court said there would be far less reason --",
  "In the implied right of action question there are two questions, did Congress intend to create a right, and did Congress intend to provide a judicial remedy? In the 1983 context, there are two questions, did Congress intend to create a right, and did Congress intend to preclude resort to the 1983 remedy, so that first question I think is the same under both categories of cases, and as the Court said in Cannon, if Congress phrases the statute as -- quote, as a prohibition on the disbursement of public funds, there's far less reason to think that they intended a private remedy. In addition, purpose speaks in terms of an institutional policy or practice, not individual instances of disclosures. Again, the contrast with a rights- creating provision like title IX is stark. Title IX says, no student shall be subject to discrimination, but FERPA doesn't look at what happens to individual students. It looks at institutional behavior, institutional policy or practice.",
  "Well, of course, the word rights does not appear in the disclosure provision, subsection (b), and in Pennhurst, where the Court was dealing with developmentally disabled bill of rights, the Court explained that just because the statute uses the word rights doesn't mean that it creates a 1983 right.",
  "Well, first of all, the Court in Blessing said that you don't look at the whole act. You have to look at the particular provision that is relied upon to create the 1983 right. Second of all, we're 6 years before Maine v. Thiboutot when Congress passed this, so it's not as if they're using rights as some term of art under the established jurisprudence, and finally, I think Congress can use the term to refer to the opportunity of parents and students to participate in the administrative remedy, to the criteria that the Secretary of Education is to use in deciding whether to terminate funds, without thereby necessarily triggering coverage under section 1982.",
  "Well, whatever rights, whether you're talking -- putting aside the question whether it's a 1983 right or a right to participate in the process that's established under the statute, it is part of the policy or practice that the Secretary of Education is to look to in deciding whether to disburse funds. The obligation is to the Secretary, not to the institution, and that is made clear when you look at what Congress said about enforcement. The Congress said, the Secretary shall enforce FERPA, and the Secretary shall deal with violations. Now, that deal-with-violations language should strike the Court as unusual and, in fact, nowhere else in the United States Code does Congress tell an agency to deal with violations. It has almost a colloquial tone to it. Mr. Secretary, FERPA is your problem, you deal with the violations. There's no suggestion that they would be dealt with by private actions brought in court and, in fact, that conclusion is reinforced when you look at subsection (g), which tells the Secretary, you set up an office to deal --",
  "12a of our statutory appendix, Your Honor.",
  "It says to the Secretary, you set up an office to investigate, process, review, and adjudicate complaints about violations under FERPA. I think this is something --",
  "There's no violation unless there's a policy.",
  "It's evidence that there might be a problem with the school's policy, and this is what makes it different, for example, from the Wright case. In Wright, the Court said, look, all you can do is terminate funding. There's no process to bring complaints to the attention of the Secretary. That's not enough. Here, Congress said to the Secretary, you set up a complaint procedure, and if someone's got a problem with the release of their records you investigate it, you process the complaint, you review it, and you adjudicate it, and what has happened is that complaints have come in, and the Family Policy Compliance Office have gotten responses from the university, and voluntary compliance has ensured that the policy and practice of the institution complies with the Secretary's view.",
  "That's correct. That's correct.",
  "In terms of the scope of liability --",
  "Exactly, but it is the fact that Congress focused on the policy or practice that helps establish that they were not concerned with individual instances of disclosure. It is odd to speak of a distinctly individual right being protected when whether it's protected or not depends on whether the school does the same thing to others. That looks more like a systemic concern, not an individual concern, and it's the --",
  "It's very important to keep in mind the distinction between how matters are handled before the Family Policy Compliance Office and in court. FERPA places a premium on voluntary compliance, on informal and inexpensive adjudication. A 1983 damages action in Federal court doesn't. The statute says the Secretary shall deal with violations, not the court. The Secretary says -- and the statute goes on to say, we're going to tell you how to deal with individual complainants. They don't go to court, either. They go to the office that's set up by the Secretary, and there they will find an informal, inexpensive procedure in which people can quickly find out what the school's answer is and, in a case in which it suggests that there's a policy or practice problem, secure voluntary problem.",
  "In fact, in practice most of what they do is field questions from the school, how do we handle this situation, what do we do about this?",
  "There certainly is. The first thing, if you're a student subjected to that, what you would do is call the Family Policy Compliance Office and the Secretary, keep in mind, has the cudgel of terminating funding behind the most informal telephone call or correspondence. Schools respond to what the Secretary of Education tells them to do with respect to FERPA, because they appreciate the sanctions that can be brought. That's the way the system has worked effectively since FERPA was enacted.",
  "The focus of the office is in vindicating what the statute provides. The statute is directed to institutional behavior. The office reviews complaints in order to secure compliance with the proper policy or practice.",
  "It is -- it is --",
  "Because --",
  "Because the statute is directed to prospective compliance, not retrospective compensation for injuries. That is a different focus than section 1983. The 1983 --",
  "The direct response is that -- you left out words in the quote, which is that no funds shall be made available to an institution that has a policy or practice, and the question is, is Congress focusing on protecting individual rights in, as the Court said in Blessing, an individual way, or are they addressing a systemic concern. The policy, or the focus on the Secretary -- this statute is directed to the Secretary. Don't make funds available, and it says, look at the policy or practice. It's not written the way title IX is, which would suggest the conferring of an individual right. Secondly, you're quoting from subsection (a). Subsection (b) does not talk about rights. And finally, the answer --",
  "I think not, because --",
  "The right to inspect is not an independent and freestanding right. It is a description of the sort of policy or practice that should prompt the Secretary of Education to withhold funds. In addition, this is not the provision that's at issue in this case. Subsection (b) --",
  "Under this section. I think Congress can use the term, rights, to refer to the opportunities that are provided to the parents and students and to the criteria that the Secretary of Education will look to in deciding funding, without thereby triggering coverage under section 1983. Just like in Pennhurst, Congress used the word rights repeatedly in --",
  "No. There would not have been -- no rights are conferred under this statute. What is conferred is discretion on the Secretary of Education to withhold funds depending upon a policy or practice. In describing the policy or practice that should trigger action by the Secretary of Education, the statute refers to opportunities that must be provided to parents and students by that institution, but in doing so I don't think Congress is necessarily triggering the right to a damages action.",
  "Well, the statute doesn't use the words right under subsection (b). The statute in Pennhurst was called the Bill of Rights, and this Court concluded that that did not confer rights. The question is whether Congress acted in a way that indicated an intent to confer an individually enforceable right.",
  "No --",
  "1232g(b) is the section at issue. Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer were quoting from 1232g(a). (a) refers to rights, (b) does not.",
  "That's (a), Your Honor. That's 1232g(a)(1)(A).",
  "(b) is on 6a, and it does not refer to rights.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor. Two statutes enacted within 2 years of each other: title IX, no person shall be subject to discrimination; FERPA, no funds shall be made available to an institution that has a policy or practice described in the statute, and the Secretary shall deal with violations, and the Secretary shall do that at one place, because we're worried about multiple interpretations causing confusion. Now, that is two -- those are two very different ways of approaching a problem. Under this Court's precedents the former, the title IX model confers privately enforceable rights. The latter does not. Why would Congress proceed differently in dealing with educational institutions in those two different contexts? Because of the appreciation that the regulation of student records from kindergarten through graduate school directly implicated pedagogical concerns. It would have been a radical notion, even in 1974, for Congress to confer individual rights on every student from kindergarten to graduate school in a way that would directly implicate the day-to-day running of schools across the country, and there's no evidence to suggest that that's what Congress had in mind. The evidence is the opposite. It proceeded gingerly. It said, this is directed to the Secretary. It's directed to policies and practice. Who's going to deal with violations? Mr. Secretary, deal with violations, and do it in one place. Four months after FERPA was enacted, in response to what was called by the sponsors the perplexity and frustration it had caused -- four months -- they added the second sentence to subsection (g) on page 12a of the blue brief, and that said, don't do any of this, Mr. Secretary, in any of the regional offices. The reason? We're afraid of multiple interpretation. Well, multiple interpretations caused by regional offices, there's a slight problem there, are, after all, answerable to the Secretary. Individual private plaintiffs suing in State and Federal court around the country, any one of these 62 million students covered by the Federal funds requirement, that would give rise to multiple interpretations, and it is implausible to suppose --",
  "Well, it is implausible to suppose that the same Congress that was so worried about multiple interpretations of the law from the regional offices of one Department would have been perfectly content and, in fact, intended to confer the right for every one of 62 million students to go into court in a 1983 action.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The petitioners' position is that when Congress said shall before October 1st, 1993, it meant may before or after October 1st, 1993. That is so, according to the petitioners because, as they read the statute, Congress could not really have intended to limit the authority of the commissioner to make assignments under the act. But there is nothing implausible or even unusual about reading the statute to mean what it says. The consequence of not assigning a particular miner by the statutory deadline is that the miner is unassigned under the statute. The statute tells us what to do with unassigned miners. There is an elaborate backup provision, as the Solicitor General calls it, to deal with unassigned beneficiaries. First and foremost, they receive the same benefits as assigned miners.",
  "Certainly. First of all, from Congress's point of view, the overriding purpose is to continue benefits. That's taken care of. Second, the coal miners get the same benefits whether they're assigned or unassigned. Now, but the argument is this undermines the pay for your own principle. But the pay for your own principle itself is -- embodies rough justice. A company that employs a miner for 2 years pays for all his benefits. Another company may have employed him for 25 years. That's the compromise that was agreed to and that's fine. But it doesn't mean that this pay for your own principle is some unqualified desideratum that you can assume Congress intended to pursue at all costs in perpetuity. We know that's not the case. They had a deadline and they imposed it.",
  "Yes, and we know that was, for example, not a purpose they wanted to pursue ueber alles. If a company goes bankrupt, those miners --",
  "It was one of the purposes, yes, and it was one that Congress said, spend a year trying to make these assignments. But then we've got to launch this fund and -- What is really going on here is that the commissioner wants to do a different sort of job than Congress delegated to her. This is the sort of project -- and I think this is a critical distinction from the deadlines in Pierce County and those sorts of cases. The agency could have done a reasonably good job on this project in 4 months, a better job in a year, maybe a nearly perfect job in 5 years. Congress said, we want the 1-year version. Why do we want the 1-year version and not the nearly perfect version? Because the miners are going to get the same benefits either way. Coal companies or funds established by coal companies are going to pay for them either way.",
  "Yes, and the question is-­",
  "No. That's right. If it had no assignments. Now, Congress --",
  "And Congress knew --",
  "And Congress knew there was some unfairness in requiring the companies to pay for unassigned beneficiaries, and it cushioned that unfairness by saying we're going to draw from this AML Fund that coal operators established earlier. That will -- it has to date ensured that there is no unassigned beneficiaries --",
  "No. That -- it's a preexisting fund that was established based, I believe, on per-ton royalties. The point is everybody is contributing in different amounts to establish --",
  "If you have to get to the third stage where there's an unassigned beneficiaries premium assessed, yes. It's done pro rata. And Peabody Coal, for example, will have a very sizeable bill if that reaches it because they have over 4,000 assigned miners. This case is about 330 miners who were assigned after October 1st. But the point is not whether you could write a funding mechanism that is more equitable or fair. It's a question of whether that's the one that Congress wrote. Congress --",
  "Well -- well, it's not like the other regulatory statutes, first of all, because it's an extraordinary grant of the authority to impose retroactive liability. The grant exists nowhere other than in the same sentence that says shall. I think that's quite different than saying, EPA, in 2 years issue clean air regulations. That's -- that's a different case. And Pierce County is quite different. I think the Government probably has inherent authority to recover misspent funds. The harm is the same harm that comes from disregarding any kind of deadline. As I said, this is the sort of project you can spend 20 years on and always come up with a more perfect assignment. Congress knew that. They knew that a significant amount of work was involved. They had to go and set up an interim funding system for February to October to give the commissioner time. The commissioner came back and said, we've done it. We've completed the project.",
  "Oh, of course.",
  "Oh, sure. Well, it's the same concern the Court noted last term in the Sigmon Coal case. The coal industry is characterized by a significant amount of transactions, mergers, acquisitions. You could be looking at acquiring a coal company, and of course, given the nature of the industry, the first question you ask is what is your liability, and they're going to say, well, it's this much. And then you -- then the -- the merger or the acquisition takes place, and then you get another notice, here are, you know, 40 new miners. And now, all of a sudden, it's this much. That was a significant concern in Sigmon Coal, and it is significant in this instance as well.",
  "I don't think interest is a significant factor just the way the interest rates have been over this time period. It certainly doesn't do much to cushion the unfairness and inequity of getting a bill retroactive as much as 5 years.",
  "The -- the interest is apparently not -- not charged.",
  "And the -- the key factor that such transactions play in this particular industry may well explain why you don't see any companies on this side of the case. I think it's always wise to be skeptical of fairness arguments that are raised by proxy. There are no companies complaining about, oh, we're going to end up potentially paying a higher pro rata assessment than otherwise because -- a number of reasons. Again, Congress cushioned the unfairness; they recognized it by making the AML Fund available. Second of all, this is a statute that is suffused with concepts of rough justice. It is not necessarily a more perfect result to pursue 5 years instead of 1 year to pay for your own principle. That does not necessarily lead to a more perfect result. It may mean that more companies who employed miners for 2 years are paying over all of those benefits than companies -- when companies who employed the same miner for 20 years don't have to pay for any. But the critical --",
  "Yes. We think that helps us, of course, because it's an express provision for an assignment after October 1st. There are no other such provisions and because --",
  "The reassignment provisions, yes. Now, I'm not aware of a situation where it's reassigned to someone who never had any assignments --",
  "That's right. But the other point is that although there's a provision for --",
  "Oh, no. It means as of October 1st. What I'm saying, in the case of a reassignment, they say you can go back and -- and reassign it. The applicable percentage is based on the assignments a particular company had as of October 1st.",
  "Because there's --",
  "Because there's a specific exception that allows reassignments. There's no exception for reassignments. And, I would point out, there is no provision that allows changes in the case of an unassigned miner, and that is what has been going on here primarily. The commissioner has been revisiting the unassigned pool, and that's why this is quite different from a lot of the other deadline cases. This is -- we think the commissioner did get the job done on time. She just wants to do a different job.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, part of it. And the one thing Congress did not do, with being told, you know, we're coming up with the deadline, they didn't change the deadline. They kept that in place. Look at what the Solicitor --",
  "No, before. In June I believe. It was asked for in February, made in June or early July.",
  "Well, I think the commissioner did get the work done on time. It's just she just wants to do a more perfect job. And what I'm saying is it's reasonable for Congress to determine we don't need the more perfect job. We need a good-enough job. And this job is good enough to get the fund launched. The one thing that's clear is that the way the petitioners read the statute, if that had been proposed when the Coal Act was -- was enacted, it never would have gotten off the ground. The idea of giving the commissioner significant discretion on an open-ended timetable was certainly not in the cards. This is the legislative equivalent of trench warfare, parties fighting over every inch. They had the black lung model which did give the Secretary of Labor significant discretion in allocating responsibility for that consequence of -- of the -- of coal mining, and they wanted nothing to do with it. That's why --",
  "I think we know it primarily -- no. There's no statement like that. I think we know it from the structure of the statute which is carefully reticulated. There is no delegation of discretion to the commissioner. The compromises in the statute are spelled out. And when you talk about revisiting fairness, keep in mind you're looking at one particular provision and you say, well, that looks unfair. It may be because another provision that's not at issue balances that out. This is, as the Court noted in Sigmon, an instance of legislative horse trading and log rolling, and they're setting up a system and everybody has to pitch in some. The older pension funds pitched in some. The operators pitched in. Congress came forward with the AML Fund, and it moved forward. And it had to be in place by October 1st or the wheels would have fallen off. This is not a deadline of the sort you've got 120 days to issue a decision. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For two reasons the question whether petitioners' claims were submitted within the 6-year time limit is for the arbitrators to decide. First, as this Court held nearly 40 years ago in John Wiley, when the parties have agreed to submit the subject matter of the underlying dispute to arbitration, the question whether the dispute was presented within a contractual time limit is presumptively for the arbitrators even if the time limit is a prerequisite that conditions the duty to arbitrate. Second, the time limit in this case is imposed by the NASD Code of Arbitration Procedure, which the parties incorporated into their agreement in full.",
  "Okay. Arbitrability is, as used in the Court's cases, a term of art that includes two questions. One of those questions is whether the parties are bound by a valid arbitration agreement and the other question is whether the subject matter of their underlying dispute is within the scope of that agreement. And by the subject matter of their underlying dispute, what I mean is whether they agreed to arbitrate disputes about the primary conduct that -- that is given rise to the -- to the underlying claim. And what the Court held in -- in John Wiley is once the parties -- once the court has determined that the parties have agreed to arbitrate disputes arising out of the -- the underlying conduct that's at issue, then questions about their litigation conduct and how those -- how that dispute was processed after it arose -- those are presumptively for the arbitrators to decide.",
  "No, Your Honor. The -- the agreement didn't use that -- that language. It said the failure of either party to file a grievance within this time limitation shall be construed and be deemed to be an abandonment of the grievance. But the point --",
  "There -- there may be --",
  "The --",
  "There may be differences, Your Honor, but -- but the -- the time limit language, the eligible for submission language, what that indicates is that the timely submission of a claim is a prerequisite to arbitration of the merits of the claim. It doesn't say one way or the other who decides whether that prerequisite has been met. It doesn't say that the timeliness question is not arbitrable.",
  "It says the underlying claim is not arbitrable --",
  "-- if it's not timely.",
  "No.",
  "You presume -- you presume that because if the parties didn't -- didn't contemplate that they would arbitrate about disputes arising from the -- from the underlying conduct, which that goes to, then they presumably didn't think the arbitrators were going to have anything to do with any questions connected with such a dispute. But when they did -- no. Here -- here we know.",
  "When --",
  "They agreed and there's -- there's no question about it that they agreed that disputes that arose from petitioners' securities accounts would be within the -- would the kind of disputes that they would arbitrate. And so when this claim arose, it was within the scope of -- of the agreement. And the question here is not whether it's the kind of claim that the parties agreed that they might arbitrate about. It's a question of whether a claim that was arbitrable when it arose has become not subject to arbitration because of the parties' litigating conduct. And ordinarily people -- people would assume that the -- the forum that they've selected to resolve the underlying dispute is going to resolve ancillary questions about how the dispute has been processed and the litigating --",
  "My -- my distinction is between and it's the distinction the Court drew in the John Wiley case and that the courts of appeals have followed for 40 years except in -- in the limited context of the question presented here. It's the -- the distinction that's -- that's been embodied in the Uniform Arbitration Act, which is cited on page 14 of the reply brief. It's the distinction between the primary conduct and whether there's a limit on what primary conduct is subject to arbitrability and other questions about -- about litigating conduct. And the -- the rule that would focus on the language of -- of the parties and parse that language to see whether it's phrased as a limit of arbitrability, to then decide whether the presumption in favor of courts deciding the question of arbitrability imposes an extra layer of complexity that doesn't -- it's not likely to reflect the -- the real intent of the parties. The -- what we're trying to figure out is not whether the parties thought this was a question of arbitrability, but who they intended to decide the -- who they intended to decide the question. And the -- and when the underlying claim is within the scope of their agreement, it's likely that they intended that ancillary questions would be decided by the party that they committed the underlying dispute to. But even setting that aside, here we've got",
  "Their language reflects their intent --",
  "It reflects their intent that -- that timely submission of a claim is a prerequisite to arbitration of the merits of that claim. But it doesn't reflect their intent of who is to decide whether the prerequisite is -- is met. There's -- it doesn't say anything about that. Rule 10324, which is also a part of the parties' agreement, does say something about that. It says that the arbitrator shall be empowered to interpret and determine the applicability of all code provisions. And the time limit is a code provision. The clear import of that, regardless of the issue that we're discussing, is that the arbitrators are empowered to apply the time limit. And so, even setting aside the 40 years of law that's settled by John Wiley and the distinction between the subject matter of the underlying dispute and -- and questions that go to the parties' litigating conduct, the agreement here is clear and that --",
  "Yes. It's -- it's concerned -- the -- the code is concerned with the rules of the arbitrable forum, and it makes sense that the arbitrators are the ones to interpret and apply those rules. And that's confirmed by Rule 10324. But -- but yes, the -- the question whether a claim is timely submitted goes not to the character of the underlying claim at the time it arose and whether claims of that character are subject to arbitration.",
  "Yes. That -- it's going to completely undermine the purpose of arbitration, Your Honor. The reason that people agree to arbitration is because they want cost effective and efficient dispute resolution, and moving all these questions into antecedent judicial proceedings is going to delay dispute resolution. It's going to impose added costs on the parties, and it's going to undermine the very reason they agreed to arbitrate. And it's -- it's -- that's another reason why it's just not likely that that's what they intended -- intended to happen.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. It's a forum-specific limit, and that's another reason why it makes sense that the forum that the limit applies to should be the one that -- that applies it. It says that cases won't be eligible for arbitration under this code. It doesn't refer to whether they might be pursued in other -- in other forums or other venues. It reinforces the -- the expectation that the arbitrators would decide it which, in any event, as I said, is -- you know, you can't get any clearer than a rule that says that the arbitrator shall be empowered to interpret and determine the applicability of all code provisions. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Alaska's Megan's Law makes available to members of the public who seek it certain truthful information about convicted sex offenders. The State makes this information available to help protect against the risk that the convicted sex offender will offend again. It says that in the law. Sex offenses are crimes of opportunity, and the purpose of making the information available is to allow the members of the public to take steps to reduce those opportunities.",
  "No, it wouldn't, Your Honor. That's the case in -- in about 14 States that -- that a quarterly verification has to be in person. It is not the case in Alaska. And simply going to the police station four times a year, which is reserved only for the most serious sex offenses, the aggravated offenses -- in all other cases it's just annually -- doesn't rise to the level of a burden that is at all tantamount to what we think of as punishment under the Ex Post Facto Clause.",
  "In-person registration?",
  "I'm not sure of one where you actually have to show up in person, but the question is whether that in-person requirement is rationally related to a legitimate regulatory purpose. That's the standard under cases like Flemming.",
  "They do not. It clearly --",
  "Even for aggravated offenses.",
  "Expressly can be filed by mail. The instructions make that clear.",
  "I don't think so, because the statute says the initial registration has to be in person. Typically it's in -- in prison. And then it says the later verification has to be in writing. So I think it would be an unreasonable reading of the statute to say that the later verification had to be in writing.",
  "The question is whether the burdens that the law imposes constitute punishment. If it's not punishment, then it's perfectly valid to apply it to people who were convicted prior to the effective date. And this is not --",
  "Only the ex post facto challenge is before the Court in this case.",
  "That's correct, and --",
  "Well, for life, again only for aggravated; for 15 years for other sex offenses. And yes, that is one of their arguments, that they can't get out of it. But this Court's cases haven't drawn that line. The question is whether the burdens are pursuant to a legitimate regulatory objective, or whether they're punitive. For example, in cases like Kansas against Hendricks, couldn't get out of that, and yet that didn't make it a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. Flemming against Nestor. You couldn't avoid the sanction there, and yet it did not rise to the level of punishment.",
  "A -- a particular subclass, yes. It was an individualized determination required because the depravation there, actual confinement, was far more severe than the depravation at issue here. But neither an individual determination, nor a chance to get out of it is required to avoid the categorization as punishment. Cases like Hawker and De Veau make clear that a -- a reasonable legislature can treat a category -- a category of sex offenders. They don't --",
  "Hawker was --",
  "Not true, of course, in Hendricks or Flemming or Salerno, no opportunity to avoid it there. You didn't have to do anything to get the sanction applied to you. Now --",
  "You have to register.",
  "You -- you have to fill out --",
  "-- one -- one side of one page. That's the form that's involved here. That in itself cannot be punishment. We -- as Your Honor mentioned -- we do that all the time in -- in today's society. So it must be something else that makes this punishment. Now, what the Ninth Circuit's -- Ninth Circuit thought was that it was publishing it on the Internet, that that made it punishment. But that's simply the most -- most efficient and most economical way of making information available. It also is passive. It's not displayed to people who have no interest in the information, and in that sense is far less invasive. The publication on the Internet will -- yes, it may cause adverse consequences when members of the community learn this public fact about someone's past. But the State is certainly free to weigh the convicted sex offender's interest in keeping that public fact from being widely known against the interest of those in the position of, say, Megan Kanka's parents.",
  "\"Weigh.\" I'm sorry. \"Weigh.\"",
  "I'm sorry. Weigh the convicted sex offender's interest in keeping a public fact about his past secret against Megan Kanka's parents' interest in knowing that their new neighbor across the street had twice been convicted of sexually abusing young girls. That's a determination for the legislature to make. There are costs --",
  "Yes, and all the State is doing --",
  "Well, there are countless analogues in the regulatory regime where people have to file quarterly reports. If -- and -- and the question is whether that requirement serves a valid regulatory purpose. It can't rise to the level of punishment just because the legislature has determined that the triggering event --",
  "There are -- there are many disabilities that are imposed as a result of a prior conviction that the Court has found don't constitute punishment.",
  "Well, the affirmative steps -- it -- that has never been the test. The test has been whether it rises to the level of punishment. Yes, the affirmative step of filling out one side of one page with the sort of information that you'd -- would put on your application to join the Price Club requires. There's nothing burdensome about that. It must be in their argument the use that that information is put to.",
  "Well, when the --",
  "That's right.",
  "Well, it's called the intent effects test. You'd first see what the intent is, and that is so critical, and nearly controlling because the same sanction can be punitive or civil depending on the purpose. Even confinement can be civil if the purpose is protective. So that's why purpose is so controlling. Now, once you determined that there's a regulatory purpose, as every court has -- not just every Federal court -- every court to look at these laws has determined they have a valid civil regulatory purpose -- then the one challenging that determination carries the heavy burden of establishing, by the clearest proof, with unmistakable evidence, that the effect is so punitive that the purported purpose must, in fact, be a charade. And --",
  "Yes. That information is available. The circumstances, the crime for which the person is convicted, is available. So --",
  "That's my understanding, Your Honor, yes, that -- that -- I'm not sure what it is in every State, but the -- the circumstances of conviction is -- it's one of the things that has to be registered, and is available to the public. So if it -- you can find out what the conviction was for. Now, I don't -- I'm sorry.",
  "It conveys simply the truthful, objective information that this individual was convicted of this crime, and the public is free to take appropriate action if they think that's -- that's appropriate under the circumstances. It is different from the historic shaming penalties because of the purpose. And again, purpose is the nearly controlling factor. The purpose of the shaming penalties was not to inform. Everybody in the colonial village knew the circumstances of the offense. The purpose was to shame. Here, the purpose is to inform.",
  "Well, it conveys the information that the legislature thought was pertinent for people to take action to protect themselves if they think it's warranted. Nothing prevents them from finding out more if they want to -- if they think that's pertinent --",
  "Well, access to the information that the legislature thought was pertinent and that people wanted to learn. There is no requirement --",
  "There's no provision for that under Alaska's laws. I am aware of situations where -- where they have a more active notification, where the offenders have taken steps to say, well, here's my side of the story, but there's no provision for that on the Internet.",
  "Well, it might violate the Due Process Clause if there's not a rational connection between --",
  "The legislature would have to show a rational basis for its categorization. That's the standard --",
  "Or -- it may or may not, depending on what it shows.",
  "Here the legislature had a solid basis, a basis that this --",
  "-- Court has recognized, as recently as last June in the McKune case, for the conclusion that those convicted have a high rate of recidivism.",
  "Well, I understood the question to be it's just the beginning of the whole story, and in that case, I'd question whether --",
  "No, there wouldn't be --",
  "Certainly not the Ex Post Facto Clause because in Seling against Young, the Court said you look at the law on its face, not as applied. Halper had started looking at laws as applied to determine whether they're punishment, and in Hudson and in Seling, the Court said we're not going to do that. I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I think it is very important to place the various points that have been touched on this morning in the proper legal framework. The question, Justice Kennedy, is not whether it's burdensome to require someone to fill out a form and verify it. The question is, is that so punitive that you don't believe the legislature when it says that we're doing this to prevent future harm? The question, Justice Ginsburg, is not whether it might be a better system if it included other information, or whether that would be too burdensome for the State. The question is, does the failure to put on ameliorative information convince you that the legislature was simply not telling the truth when it said we're doing this to prevent future harm? And the question is not whether you should have an individualized determination or a group determination. It is, is the group determination so irrational that you think the legislature was not really interested in preventing future harm, it was just doing this to punish? In fact, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, this Court has never found a law with a civil regulatory purpose to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.",
  "I think that is --",
  "I think it only makes sense if you view it as impeaching the intent because, as Chief Justice Warren pointed out in Trop v. Dulles, the evident purpose is controlling because the same sanction can be civil or criminal. $10,000 civil penalty is not criminal. A $10,000 fine is. You don't look at the perspective of the individual because --",
  "I think if the regulation is so burdensome that it causes you to doubt the intent, then you do have a problem, but that is the purpose.",
  "But again, with respect to both the Ex Post Facto Clause and the Due Process Clause, the question is whether there's a rational connection between the sanction and the legislative purpose. Now, if it is too extreme, it may cause you to doubt that connection. For example, it may be -- the legislature may say we think safe crackers present a risk of recidivism, so we're going to cut off their hands. There may be a rational connection there, but it's too excessive given the purpose. There's no way in which this law can be regarded as too excessive. It simply makes available information that is already a matter of public record, and publicly available because criminal trials under our system have to be public. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a defendant does not petition this Court for certiorari on direct appeal, his judgment of conviction becomes final within the meaning of section 2255 when the time for filing a petition expires. That interpretation accords with the well-settled meaning of final and the law of collateral review, and it sensibly provides Federal prisoners the same time to prepare collateral attacks as similarly situated State prisoners.",
  "The judgment would become final if there -- if no appeal was filed at the time -- when the time to file an appeal expired after the 10-day period.",
  "Well, we're talking about finality for -- for a different purpose here. It's not a question of finality for the purpose of seeking appeal, or when a judgment -- in the term like final judgment, which is -- which would be the sense of finality when, for the purposes of deciding --",
  "Well, in -- in terms of -- of collateral review, first of all the Congress used the particular phrase, when the judgment becomes final, that has an established meaning in that context. Second of all, it's logical that the time to commence collateral review should start to run at the conclusion of direct review, which this Court has made clear includes the period when -- within which to seek certiorari even if a petition isn't filed, and that's, in fact, what Congress concluded in section 2244, the parallel provision for State prisoners, and there's no persuasive reason why Congress would have started the -- the time limitation at a different time for Federal prisoners.",
  "Well, that -- that -- well, I'm talking about a -- a reason why they would have intended that result as opposed to a -- a canon or a textual indication that there might be a difference, but even as to the textual indication --",
  "But --",
  "But this doesn't concern the processes of the State, Your Honor, it concerns review in -- in this Court, and this Court's made clear the -- the distinction of the time is between whether the -- the time to seek review in this Court is included or is not included, and that's not a -- a State -- a remedy, this Court's made clear that exhaustion of State remedies doesn't require a petitioner to seek review in this Court, that State remedies are exhausted as long as all avenues of review are pursued in -- in the State court system. So concerns about -- concerns about requiring them to go through the full State court system wouldn't justify the difference in the rule, nor would generalized concerns about comity, which would suggest that State prisoners ought to have less time to seek review from their convictions, if -- if anything, to upset their State court convictions, rather than -- than more time. And really, collateral review rules are driven more by finality concerns, which are equally strong in the Federal context and the State context. That's why the Teague retroactivity rules and rules of procedural default apply equally to both, and because finality concerns are the same, there -- there isn't any persuasive reason why Congress would have started the time limit at a different time. The negative -- the negative inference points, to address the negative inference point, there are three reasons why it would be inappropriate to draw a negative inference from the omission of the clarifying language here. First, it contradicts the presumption that Congress used final in accordance with its settled meaning in the collateral review context, which petitioner discussed earlier.",
  "Yes, it explicates the meanings, but it explicates the meanings by providing the definition that is the -- is -- by providing an explication that's consistent with the background definition that you would expect final to have, and there's a -- there are good reasons why Congress would have -- might have wanted to explicate the -- to explicate it more carefully in 2244. Petitioner discussed one, which is that 2244 concerned State prisoners, and Congress might have been concerned that, absent clarification, courts might import the definition of finality used by the State of conviction, and there are varying definitions there. There's not the uniform definition that would include review in this Court. Second, it's possible that Congress might have been concerned that the courts would assume that the time limit in section 2244 starts to run the same time as the time limit in section 2263, which also concerns State prisoners, State capital defendants and States subject to expedited collateral review proceedings, and so Congress --",
  "-- may have spelled it out here.",
  "No, I -- I don't think that it makes a difference. There are variations in -- in language like that.",
  "Yes, Your Honor, but it's referring back to the judgment of the State court under which the person is in custody. The -- the provision 2244(d)(1) is reproduced in the gray brief on page 2 to 3. So where it says the date on which the judgment became final, it's -- it's referring back to a -- a person who's in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, and that would be the judgment of the district court -- I mean, of the trial court in -- in that situation, but fundamentally, our points are two. One, there's a background rule, and the presumption is generally of -- of what -- when a judgment becomes final in the collateral review context, and it's generally presumed, with good reason, that Congress legislates against that background rule and uses the terms with their settled meaning in that context; and second, we know Congress did that with respect to State prisoners in section 2244 because they clarified it there; and it makes sense that the time limitation should run at the same time, because there's no persuasive reason for them to run at a different time.",
  "They were enacted as part of the -- the same statute, Your Honor, but the -- the proposition that the same word has the same meaning, the same word becomes final, has the same meaning throughout the statute -- same statute would apply by virtue of that. So the -- so that we would expect that when Congress said, becomes final in section 22 -- 2255, and when it said, became final in 2244, both referring to a judgment of the trial court convicting the defendant, that it -- it intended those phrases to have the same meaning.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, that -- that would be one possibility, that here it was restricted --",
  "-- but it was broader.",
  "Yes, but it's hard for me to conceive, frankly, what the broader --",
  "-- understanding of finality is, Your Honor. I do think that -- that not every time that -- that Congress uses the different language to -- that's more amplified and clarifying, does that -- that mean that --",
  "-- that the words -- and the Court does not generally -- does not generally apply the negative inference, the Russello presumption to draw the conclusion that the -- that identical phrases have -- have different meaning.",
  "That -- that would be --",
  "That would be parallel to Russello and parallel to some other cases where there's been additional limiting language, and the Court has said therefore, the -- we won't read that limit into the earlier language, but in those cases also what bears note is that the word that was limited later on, here the word becomes -- the phrase becomes final, was by the Court, in those cases, given its ordinary meaning, what you would expect, apart from the Russello presumption.",
  "And here --",
  "Yes. Yes, Your Honor, and there isn't -- there isn't an ordinary meaning across the board in every context, but here we have a -- a narrow context in which Congress has acted in the collateral review context, in particular in the commencement of collateral review, and in this Court's cases, in the collateral review context, particularly delineating when direct review ends and collateral review begins, the Court has used repeatedly, over 30 years before enactment of AEDPA, the -- this established definition of finality, and there's -- there's no reason why Congress would have departed from that here. If there are no further questions, we would submit.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For more than 125 years, it has been clear that the National Bank Act provides the exclusive cause of action for a claim of usury against a national bank. Because the National Bank Act provides the sole available avenue of relief, any claim that a national bank has committed usury can arise only under that Federal law. The National Bank --",
  "A failure to state a claim on which relief is granted does not deprive the Federal court of jurisdiction over the claim. So the simple failure to state a claim wouldn't prevent it from being removable if the -- if the claim was within the scope of the Federal cause of action, if it was a colorable claim. Now, if -- if the claim --",
  "If -- if the claim was not colorable --",
  "Well, here -- here we -- we don't have that situation, Your Honor.",
  "That --",
  "When it's removed, the Federal court decides whether there's jurisdiction under Federal law, whether there's arising-under jurisdiction, and decides whether the -- the complaint is properly pleaded, the true nature of the complaint states a claim under Federal law. And --",
  "If it doesn't, then it can remand the State -- the case back to State court, but it would have decided, in essence, that the claim should be dismissed at the same time by deciding --",
  "Well, to the extent that the State claim requires the decision that a -- a determination that there were excessive interest charges by a national bank, then the claim would fall within the scope of the cause of action. But that wouldn't mean that there couldn't be claims for misrepresentation that --",
  "The complaint --",
  "The State cause of action is just misrepresentation.",
  "Then that would not be removable.",
  "Yes. I don't think that would be removable, Your Honor.",
  "That -- that --",
  "Yes, but the existence of pendent State claims doesn't defeat removal jurisdiction just as it doesn't defeat original jurisdiction. There were pendent State claims in the Metropolitan Life case, yet --",
  "Exactly, Your Honor. The supplemental jurisdiction statute, 1367, expressly provides for Federal court jurisdiction in those instances. They would come with -- with the claim to Federal court.",
  "That's -- that's right, Your Honor. The -- the misrepresentation claim and the suppression claim are both species of fraud claim under State law. They don't come within the -- the scope of the cause of action in the National Bank Act, and they're not, on their own terms, arise under Federal law and they would not be removable.",
  "What -- what -- I tried to distinguish between failure to state a claim, which I agree the simple failure to state a claim is -- is not a ground for lack of Federal jurisdiction, Your Honor.",
  "There is no Alabama claim because the only claim can arise under Federal law. So it -- so it is removable and then the Federal court would assert Federal jurisdiction, which it has over the claim and dismiss it.",
  "Yes. Yes, Your Honor. But -- but that was the initial question that I -- that I understood Justice Scalia to be asking. But then he said, if it's not colorable on the face of the complaint, what happens then? But I don't think it makes a practical difference.",
  "The critical -- you have to know --",
  "There still -- there still could be a colorable claim under --",
  "We don't know what the rate --",
  "You don't know what the rate is, Your Honor, under Federal law without -- without more facts about the complaint because the National Bank Act provides the -- the possibility the national bank can charge any of three rates. But the --",
  "-- the fundamental -- the fundamental point is that -- that it's removable if there's jurisdiction in the original jurisdiction of the Federal court.",
  "If -- if there is -- if the claim properly pleaded states a claim over which there's Federal jurisdiction, if it was pled as a claim under the National Bank Act --",
  "No.",
  "You can --",
  "No -- no, Your Honor. You can remove it if there's -- if there's original -- would be original jurisdiction over the complaint. And that doesn't matter whether it's characterized as a -- as a complaint under State law, which doesn't -- doesn't exist because it's been entirely displaced, or if it's properly pled as a -- as a claim under Federal law. You could just as easily ask if they state the claim --",
  "I'm telling you that if the -- if there's no colorable claim --",
  "Well --",
  "Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.",
  "The -- the removal statute gives the -- gives the -- the Federal courts -- gives the defendant the right to remove to a Federal forum any claim that arises under the laws of the United States --",
  "-- and so -- so the question is whether it arises under, whether there's original jurisdiction in the Federal court.",
  "Yes.",
  "I'm -- I'm sorry, Your Honor. Yes.",
  "Yes, you're right.",
  "Yes. If there -- if I understand the hypothetical, it's not a situation where it arises under the exclusive cause of action for usury under the National Bank Act.",
  "Yes.",
  "The Federal -- the Federal claim would be removable to -- to Federal court, yes.",
  "Yes. Yes, Your Honor, it's removal. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Hundreds of thousands of shareholders, partners, and sole proprietors who work for the businesses they own are currently covered by benefit plans that also cover other employees. All of those different types of working owners are participants subject to the rights and remedies of ERISA, just like the other employees in the plans. And that's clear from the text of ERISA which contains several partial exemptions, which Mr. Holifield referred to some of, for certain plans that cover working owners, and those exemptions presuppose that working owners may be ERISA participants. In addition, working owners have long been eligible to participate, along with other employees, in pension plans qualifying for favorable tax treatment. And ERISA was intended to harmonize with those tax provisions and it didn't revoke the ability of working owners to participate in tax qualified plans. Coverage of working owners also furthers ERISA's purposes of ensuring that employee benefit plans are governed by a single set of regulations, of encouraging plan creation, and of protecting plan participants. So there's no question that the other non-owner employees that are covered by plans that also cover working owners are participants subject to the rights and remedies of And if the working owners in those plans were not also ERISA participants, they would be subject to different regulations and have different rights and remedies than other employees in the same plan. They might even be prohibited from being covered by the plans at all, and that result would place the coverage provisions of title I of ERISA at war with the tax provisions governing pension plans and with the insurance provisions of title IV of ERISA, both of which cover plans in which working owners participate along with other employees.",
  "No. The -- the -- it's clear and it's accepted in the opinions below that it is a qualified plan for -- for tax purposes. But it -- there's a strong possibility that if -- if the working owner, Dr. Yates, is not an ERISA participant under title I of ERISA, that title I would prohibit him from being in the plan at all, which would be a very anomalous situation because the tax code is encouraging him to be in the plan along with other employees. And title I of ERISA would be prohibiting what the tax code encourages, and if it were a defined benefit plan, which this one doesn't happen to be, it would in fact be insured also under title IV of ERISA which insures plans in which working owners participate along with other employees. And in addition, allowing working owners to participate along with other employees, as I was alluding to before, advances ERISA's purpose of encouraging employee benefit plans because the ability to participate themselves gives working owners an incentive to establish plans for other workers. It also could create economies of scale in plan administration and investment and it encourages owners to monitor the plans to ensure that they're well managed and that they're well funded. So for all of those reasons, the Department of Labor has issued the advisory opinion stating that owners can be participants in ERISA plans. The IRS and the PBGC share that view, and it's entitled to substantial weight. The -- the reason that the court of appeals reached the contrary conclusion is it misread the regulation that Justice Breyer was discussing with Mr. Holifield earlier.",
  "Yes. Skidmore deference, Your Honor, on the interpretive letter, although --",
  "No. We don't think you need any deference, Your Honor. The one point that --",
  "I -- I have no desire for --",
  "We're not asking -- we're not asking for Chevron deference. As the Chief Justice pointed out, we think that it's --",
  "We read Mead to say ordinarily -- particularly since in Christianson, the Court was confronting an opinion letter from the Department of Labor, I would hesitate to suggest that an opinion letter from the Department of Labor here and a statute that is, as far as I can tell, no different in how it treats opinion letters, would be entitled to greater deference than --",
  "Well --",
  "That's a different -- yes. Yes, Your Honor. On the question -- on the question of the Secretary's interpretation of her regulation as to limit the definition of employee to only the regulation itself and to not extend to the statute, on that point the Secretary's interpretation of her own regulation is controlling. That would be Udall, Auer v. Robbins, which is also a Labor Department case. And I think there's no question about that as well. One point I did want to make is that we would urge the Court to make clear in its opinion that all types of working owners, not just those that are common law employees, are -- are eligible to be participants under ERISA. And the reason for that is that there's confusion on that in the courts of appeals and the very reasons -- same reasons that justify the conclusion that sole shareholders can be ERISA participants also justify the conclusion that sole proprietors and partners who are not common law employees, if they are working for the businesses, may be ERISA participants.",
  "As a general matter, I think that person could not be covered as a -- a participant. The person might be designated by a participant as a -- as a beneficiary or in certain circumstances designated by the plan as a beneficiary in connection with a participant in the plan who was an -- an employee. But the definition of employee for ERISA is the same definition as under 401 of the Internal Revenue Code which is common law employees plus self-employed individuals who are people that are providing personal services to the business and getting earned income. Responds to Your Honor. If there are no further questions, we would ask that the judgment of the court of appeals be reversed and remanded.",
  "Well, in -- in Clackamas, the Court followed the same approach that the Court followed in Darden. And the first step in that approach is to look to the statute.",
  "And so we would say Clackamas just doesn't come in because you look to the statute. The statute makes clear that all the types of working owners can be covered, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The actual innocence exception applies in the extraordinary case where a prisoner has been convicted of a crime that he did not commit. The Court shouldn't extend that narrow exception to the very different situation where the prisoner is guilty of the crime of which he was convicted.",

  "It -- it -- yes, except that, you know, certainly our -- our primary interest in the question here is in the question that's divided the circuits and in making clear that there isn't a broad actual innocence exception as applied to -- to non-capital sentencing.",
  "That -- that's -- that's right, Your Honor. It may well frequently be the case, which is why you wouldn't need the actual innocence exception for that -- for that circumstance. But -- but our concern is that a rule that applies to the exception where the prisoner is guilty of the crime and is claiming only that he's suffering an excessive prison term, if taken to its logical conclusion, that would open up final judgments where a criminal defendant is belatedly claiming that a sentencing guideline was incorrectly applied to him and that he's therefore innocent of the sentence.",

  "If you overruled Almendarez-Torres, we would agree that the actual innocence exception applies in this particular case.",
  "But again, our concern is with broad application of the actual innocence exception to sentencing and to the many findings that are involved there, and the fact is that the Court hasn't overruled Almendarez-Torres. We're talking about even in this case just an erroneous sentence. We're not talking about an innocence of an offense with the special constitutional status that that entails and the special stigma that's attached to innocent, to an offense.",

  "I -- Your Honor, the -- the -- it -- it's certainly an unfairness, but there are substantial costs to -- to extending it to these many -- there are many factors that are involved in sentencing, and the fact is the prisoner's still guilty of the offense of conviction here, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: If I could begin by addressing the issues that you were just talking about, there was a distinction that the Court could have drawn between Apprendi and Blakely and that reasonable jurists could have drawn and did draw. One was the formal distinction that you were discussing before with the State, which was supported by Justice O'Connor's proposing that as an interpretation in her dissent and the majority not responding to that, that that distinction was contrary to the rule but implausible, but in fact accepting the -- accepting that it was a plausible distinction and saying that it still wouldn't have made a difference, that the Apprendi rule still was important. The second -- and in addition to that, that distinction that Justice O'Connor drew there was consistent with the Apprendi Court's distinction of Walton. And you have to look at what reasonable jurists could have interpreted looking at that decision at the time with those distinctions and what the Court said in Apprendi. But in addition to that, there was more than a formal distinction that could have been drawn between the system in Apprendi and the Washington guidelines system. That's the distinction that we proposed in our amicus brief in Blakely and it rested on the fact that sentencing guideline systems like Washington try to channel but not to eliminate the discretion that sentencing judges have to sentence within the otherwise applicable limits. And in the Washington system the sentencing judge retained a significant degree of discretion that reasonable jurists could have analogized to traditional sentencing systems that aren't constrained by Apprendi. The facts, the facts on which the judge could rely to go above the guidelines, were not specified as in Apprendi and as in Ring by the legislature, but it was a wide open set that enabled the judge himself or herself to determine what facts the judge thought could justify a higher sentence; and in addition, the facts alone didn't trigger the higher sentence. The judge had to look at those facts and make the additional determination that those facts rose to the level of substantial and compelling reasons that justified the higher sentence. In that respect, the judge had a degree of sentencing discretion to decide what facts justified it and whether it was in fact justified. Now, of course, this Court rejected those distinctions in Blakely. But the question is whether a reasonable jurist could have accepted those distinctions and drawn a difference, and we submit that they could have.",
  "We don't have a position on that precise, on that particular issue here, because it can't arise for Federal prisoners. But let me explain why it can't arise for Federal prisoners because perhaps that will give the Court some guidance in resolving the issue. In the Federal system, it's well established that the conviction and the sentence are part of a unitary judgment and that that unitary judgment doesn't become final until the conviction and the sentence have both been fully adjudicated. That understanding is reflected in the language of 28 U.S.C. 2255, which is the statute that authorizes collateral attacks by Federal prisoners. That statute authorizes attacks -- what it authorizes is motions to vacate, set aside, or correct a sentence. So it's clear from that that it's not authorizing collateral attacks on a conviction independent of the attendant sentence. And I think that could shed some guidance here, because 2255 was intended to be a parallel and substitute remedy to traditional habeas for Federal prisoners. I would also make a point on the other sort of preliminary issues that were being discussed on the consecutive sentence issue, that it's not only the fact that the judge said that the multiple offense policy standing alone could justify the consecutive sentence here and that the court of appeals relied on that in upholding that. But the court of appeals went further, because petitioner had made a separate challenge to - - and this is on page 52 and 53 of the joint appendix. Petitioner made a separate challenge to the other two aggravating factors. Petitioner argued that the district court wasn't allowed to rely on -- excuse me, the trial court couldn't rely on those two other aggravating factors because he had not relied on them in the original sentencing and this was a resentencing. The court of appeals rejected that challenge and it rejected that challenge because it said the sentencing court concluded that the multiple offense policy alone justified the exceptional sentence, and then on page 53 it said: \"The sentencing court did not rely on the additional aggravating factors for imposing an exceptional sentence.\" So I think these - -",
  "Well, that is how - -",
  "The trial court said each of the three standing alone was sufficient. But what the court of appeals said is these other two have been challenged, but these other two are -- we're not going to deal with this challenge to these other two factors because they're out of the case. So I think that this Court has to take the case as coming from - - coming from the Washington courts as if what the courts essentially said is those other two are not in the case any more.",
  "Well, what the Washington appellate court essentially, they could have said petitioner is right, those other two aggravating factors couldn't be relied on, and so we're relying on this the standing alone. What they chose to do is, we're going to interpret what the trial court did as relying only on the one. And that was the basis for responding to that claim of error, and I do think that the Court has to take this case as coming on that basis. If I could turn to the issue of Blakely retroactivity for a few minutes. In addition to the points that I made before about why Blakely was a new rule, I would also submit that Blakely is not a watershed rule because it's not a bedrock rule that's essential to a fair trial, and rules are only bedrock if they approach the fundamental and sweeping importance of Gideon, and Blakely doesn't have that kind of importance for three reasons. First, the right to counsel pervasively affects every aspect of the trial, but Blakely affects only the procedure for determining the punishment of defendants who have already been found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt of all the elements of a crime. Second, a felony trial in which the defendant is denied counsel is inherently unfair, but it's not inherently unfair to use the preponderance standard to find facts that determine the extent of punishment, and in fact the Constitution permits the use of a preponderance standard to find many facts that have as much or more impact on punishment as facts covered by Blakely. Those include facts that trigger mandatory minimums, facts on which a judge relies to sentence within a broad statutory range, and even facts on which a judge relies to sentence above the standard range in advisory guideline systems. Third, counsel is so essential to a fair trial that deprivation of the right can never be discounted as harmless error. But this Court held in Recuenco that Blakely errors can be harmless, and in reaching that holding the Court expressly concluded that Blakely errors do not necessarily render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence. That conclusion seems to strongly suggest that Blakely is not a bedrock rule essential to a fair trial. If the Court has no further questions - -",
  "For a small dealer. But as we've already heard, the dealers who engage in the discount policy are prices like Target and Wal-Mart. Those aren't small dealers. Those are behemoths in the retailing industry.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: An employer does not have a fiduciary duty to consider merger as a means of terminating a defined benefit pension plan. First of all, just like the decision to terminate the plan, the decision to merge the plan is a sponsor function, because it's a choice to alter the design, composition and structure of the plan. And because both the decision to terminate and the decision to merge are sponsor functions, the choice between the two is a sponsor function. The plan administrator has a duty to carry out the sponsor's decision to terminate the plan, not to revisit that decision by considering whether to merge the plan instead.",
  "Well, that would be not be a distribution of the assets as a means of terminating the plan, but the employer as a sponsor could, of course, decide to merge the plan instead of to terminate the plan, if the employer made that choice.",
  "Yes. There are two reasons that I say that. First, even in the case of a sponsor of a plan that's going out of business, and that isn't going to be participating in any merged plan, the merger still is a decision to alter the design and composition and structure of the plan, as this case illustrates for the reasons that Mr. Baker said. That it's going to change fundamentally the plan from a single employer plan to a multi-employer plan, that it's going to change the -- who is the administrator, that it's going to increase the pool of participants, that it's going to affect the benefits, because the assets that were available to pay the benefits are now going to be available to pay benefits of other participants in the, in the successor plan, that the PBGC's guarantee of the benefits is going to be lower in a multi-employer plan. So for all those reasons, it's going to change, still change the structure of the plan. But in addition to that, the employer of -- the sponsor of this plan that would either terminate, or possibly merge, has a legitimate interest in choosing termination rather than merger, because in a termination, the sponsor can obtain a reversion of the surplus assets, and still fully provide all the benefits of the employees.",
  "No, Your Honor, and that goes back to a confusion that I think was -- was present before, that the decision about the distribution options at termination is a sponsor decision that the employer makes in the plan documents, because those distribution options are benefits under the plan. And while Section 1341(b)(3)(A), in isolation, might appear to permit the plan administrator to choose which of those distribution options that are in the plan to make available, other provisions of ERISA and the tax code prohibit the plan from vesting that discretion in the plan administrator. So in other words, the way it works is when the employer sets up the plan, the employer provides for the forms of distribution that are going to be available at termination. And those forms are just forms of benefits, optional ways of providing the accrued benefits to the participants. And then the participants get to pick among those options at termination.",
  "Well, we think that one requirement is that it's consistent with the plan, and the plan didn't provide that here.",
  "Held it was waived.",
  "That would certainly be a basis on which the Court of Appeals could have correctly decided this case, other than the way it did.",
  "It was presented. The Court of Appeals held that Petitioner had waived the argument, based on the terms of the plan, because Petitioner hadn't made that argument in the bankruptcy court, even though the district court had actually addressed the terms of the plan, but mistakenly construed the plan to permit merger, Your Honor.",
  "I don't think that you have to assume that, Your Honor. I think that because the Court of Appeals vacated the district court's decision, you know, there is no decision on it. And if it's necessary to -- to resolving the questions presented, I think the Court could address that question. We don't think it's necessary to resolve the questions presented because we think that merger is a, is a sponsor decision as a choice to alter the design, composition and the structure of the plan even if it arises in the context of termination. And in addition, we also think that merger is not a permissible method of plan termination under the statute or PBGC regulations which treat merger and termination as distinct procedures. The statute requires that the assets of a terminating plan be distributed by allocating them among the participants of that plan. That just doesn't occur in a merger. Instead the assets are transferred to the successor plan and in the successor plan they are commingled to fund the benefits of all the participants in that plan.",
  "The plan document could provide for a reversion for the employer and in fact this -- it does. But the - -",
  "That. Yes, because that would be consistent with ERISA and the administrator has to follow the plan in accordance with ERISA.",
  "Well, an employer, not an administrator could, could as a sponsor of the plan decide to do a transfer of assets and liabilities of some portion of the, of the plan assets and retain some assets in the plan.",
  "What the employer would have to do would be make a sponsor decision to make a transfer of assets and liabilities to the PACE plan before terminating the plan. The employer could make that decision but that, that decision and the decision afterwards to terminate the remains of the plan would both be sponsor decisions that the employer wouldn't make in a fiduciary capacity.",
  "It -- it could conceivably do that, Your Honor, subject to the fact that there are guidelines that the agencies have put out, the 1984 joint guidelines that require in some cases, in order to prevent circumvention of the termination requirements, that require the purchase of annuities or the other distribution of the assets, that those guidelines require that if there is a spinoff or a transfer of assets that's followed by the, by the termination of the remains of the transferee plan, that in some circumstances annuities have to be purchased for the accrued benefits of the participants that are transferred into the other ongoing plan and that are going to be participants of that plan.",
  "Yes, Your Honor but that would be a decision that they make as sponsor of the plan.",
  "Yes, Your Honor, subject to the fact that here it's quite possible that the PBGC would consider a transfer of assets and liabilities just to leave assets in a plan as a reversion, that they would be subject to that requirement. And so they would have to annuitize the benefits of, of the participants in the plan. Because the PBGC would -- would look at that and they would say that looks like an effort just to extract assets out of what's really an ongoing plan because the employer is not going to be participating in that other plan. The -- they are just stripping it.",
  "If I could answer the question. The -- the -- they could not -- the plan administrator could decide to give the reversion to the employees and not -- not take a reversion. It could amend the plan to allow that but the point is it has a legitimate interest in taking the reversion and that that interest encourages plan sponsors to fully fund their plan, and depriving it of that would prevent them from that discourage full funding of plans.",
  "Let me try, Justice Breyer. First of all, if there was a judgment on that hypothetical tort action that you just mentioned, if there were a judgment you wouldn't have gotten the judgment in the first place unless you had originally come within - -",
  "Yes.",
  "And the stopping place I think is a Federalism concept and a due process concept, because as this Court has held in a number of cases, there's a real due process question if liens are created with no concern about the effect on the defendant. You have to take a look at the interest of the so-called plaintiff and you have to find whether there is a relationship between the lien and the underlying claim. Now - -",
  "Is that, is that your test, if it has any electioneering purpose?",
  "Do we, do we usually place the burden when we're applying strict scrutiny under the First Amendment on the challenger to prove that they're allowed to speak, as opposed to the Government to prove -- to carry the burden that they can censor the speech?",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Seventh Circuit misconstrued the Federal money laundering statute by interpreting the term \"proceeds\" to mean profits. The statute prohibits the laundering of all the gross receipts of a crime, not just its profits. The primary meaning of \"proceeds\" is gross receipts, and the statutory context makes clear that's the meaning Congress intended here. The statute is structured to prevent criminals from using the fruits of their crimes to promote or to conceal their illegal activities. But a profits definition of proceeds would constrict the statute in ways that can't be squared with that statutory objective. Because the word \"proceeds\" appears in the introductory section of the statute, those kinds of restrictions would apply to both concealment and promotion cases. For example, the statute wouldn't cover expense payments that are structured to conceal the unlawful nature and source of the funds involved. That means that if an illegal gambling operator recorded the compensation that he paid his collectors as salary payments by a legitimate business that he owned, that that would not be covered under the statute.",
  "Well, Congress was trying - -",
  "No, Your Honor. That's not what we're arguing. What we're arguing is that there is no reason that Congress wouldn't have covered these transactions and that they implicate the objectives of the statute as revealed by its text, just as much as the transactions that are clearly covered.",
  "Well, Your Honor - -",
  "-- it is certainly true that illegal gambling and money laundering are going to occur together, but that isn't a cause for concern. It just reflects the fact that certain businesses, illegal businesses like gambling operations, like drug dealing, frequently generate large amounts of cash and they need to launder that cash in order to survive and to prosper.",
  "Well, it's not the same conduct in that the conduct here, the paying the winners and paying the collectors is not a required element of the gambling offense.",
  "And, true - -",
  "It -- it -- it's true, Your Honor, that they're not going to last very long. They're not going to survive. They're not going to grow. That's because they need to commit money laundering in different ways to do that.",
  "That is, if the -- if the payment would promote the continuing -- if they've got a continuing robbery operation and by paying him he's going to say, he's saying, you know, keep on continuing in the operation and let's expand it further.",
  "Your Honor, your question and a lot of the questions I'm getting, I think express concern about treating these transactions as promotion under the statute. But the question - -",
  "What I don't - -",
  "No, because what needs to be concealed, what there needs to be is a financial transaction that's designed, the transaction itself, to conceal the nature and source of the proceeds.",
  "I don't think that doing a robbery in the alley would be a financial transaction - - would be designing a financial transaction to conceal the unlawful nature and source of the proceeds. But if I can give you an example of - -",
  "I agree with that, Your Honor. I was going to try to say to Justice Souter's question before that if you have concerns that these kind of expense payments should not be treated as promotional money laundering, the way to address those is not by adopting a profit construction of proceeds, because that would do tremendous violence to the statute in other ways. And I do think that there are - -",
  "Well, I think it's difficult to interpret the proceeds, the term \"proceeds,\" to mean something different for business operations than for other crimes because it's the same word. But even so, Your Honor, there are other ways - -",
  "Okay. I'm sorry. Even so, there are other ways in which a profits definition just makes no sense under this statute, besides the numerous concealment transactions that would be excluded that Congress would have no reason not to cover. It also would make no sense as applied to professional money launderers. Those are people who are hiding money for criminals as a matter of their business. Because they wouldn't be guilty of money laundering, even if they knew that they were concealing money that was generated by a Federal felony, unless they also knew that the money was profits.",
  "That's right. That's another point, Your Honor, that a profits definition itself isn't going to solve the problem of where the underlying crime and the money laundering - -",
  "It's not going to -- it's not -- first of all, this case doesn't present the interpretation of promotion and the Court would be free to address that in - -",
  "Yes.",
  "You certainly could, Your Honor. But that would not be an alternative ground that would be appropriate for you to rule on in this case, because that issue was raised on direct appeal. It was decided against Respondents by the - -",
  "You can obviously address any issue that you want to, Your Honor. But the ordinary rule is that issues that have been decided on direct review shouldn't be relitigated on collateral attack. The issue wasn't addressed by either of the courts below in these collateral proceedings.",
  "We do submit that it was resolved correctly in this case, because, as the Seventh Circuit held and as all the other courts of appeals have held about promotion, the payments to the winners and the payments to the collectors encourage the continued participation of the collectors and encourage the increased participation by gamblers.",
  "You could do that, but the question that I think that is concerning the Court was resolved by the Seventh Circuit in this very case on direct appeal. So on direct appeal, the argument was made by Mr. Santos that these transactions can't count as promotional money laundering because they're essential transactions of the business and that they don't promote the carrying on of the business, and the court of appeals rejected those arguments.",
  "Well, we certainly would prefer that you did that than that you interpreted proceeds to mean profits because of the violence that it would do to the remainder of the statute, Your Honor. I was talking about professional money launderers before and how they wouldn't be guilty of money laundering if they were concealing money that they knew that was generated by a crime. And Congress - - there's no reason that Congress would have considered those professional money launderers to be less culpable merely because they might be laundering only illicit receipts. And It would be very difficult for the government to prove that professional money launderers knew that they were laundering profits because they haven't participated in the predicate crime.",
  "Well, I think you decide the question presented here and you decide that proceeds means that -- that proceeds means gross receipts, because that's the only meaning that makes sense with the statute. But the sentencing point you make is a very, very good one, Your Honor. And the fact is that the Sentencing Guidelines were changed in 2001 to align the punishment for money laundering when people participate in the underlying crime much more with the punishment level for the underlying crime. And -- you know, in addition, as we know, the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory, and so courts could certainly take into account concern about overlap - -",
  "Well, I think that you can't have all of them together, Your Honor, unfortunately. But I do think that we would say that out of the three that you raised, the best way to deal with concerns about this would be in the sentencing context.",
  "It's not -- Your Honor, it's just not exactly the same activity, because people can commit gambling without commit money laundering. They can be guilt of illegal gambling without being guilty of money laundering - -",
  "But they can be -- even under this definition, Your Honor. In this very case there were restaurant and tavern owners that permitted the gambling bets to be taken on their premises because it increased their -- the patronage of their businesses. And they were convicted of participating in illegal gambling operations. They didn't commit money laundering, because they didn't engage in a financial transaction that's not an element of the gambling offense, that involves the proceeds of the offense, and that's intended either to conceal the proceeds - -",
  "It is -- but the statute defines what the three -- the statue defines what the three elements of the gambling business are, Your Honor. That it's illegal gambling that's illegal under State law, that involves 5 or more persons, that it has - - continues for more than 30 days or has more than $2,000 in gross revenues in a day.",
  "The gambling business -- it might be gambling and fraud, Your Honor. But the gambling business can continue for more than 30 days without having paid the winners if they had a lottery every month, and it was at the end of the month -- they hadn't paid the winners yet, it would have gone for the 30 days, in a 31-day month without -- without having paid the winners.",
  "Yes. I think that what they're asking you to do is to interpret -- and what the Seventh Circuit has done, is to interpret proceeds in a way that makes no sense for the statute in order to deal with these concerns about promotion cases that can be dealt with in the other ways that Justice Breyer raised. And there are really four - -",
  "I'm sorry, Your Honor. I probably should know the answer to what the precise range would be under the guidelines. Now, I don't. But what I do know is before, the way the guidelines worked was that the base offense level for a money laundering crime was not tied to the offense level for the underlying offense. So it was set I think starting at 23 for promotional money laundering. But what happened in 2001 is that the commission changed the rules so that when you -- when the money laundering involves the person who participated in the underlying offense and has also done the money laundering, you start with the offense level for the underlying offense and then you make some minor increases depending upon the type and the - -",
  "Well, because he does engage in something more than what he needs to do to be punished for the underlying offense, and that conduct is -- and that conduct is -- promotes ongoing crime or can conceal ongoing crime in ways that are just what Congress was getting at in the statute. And - -",
  "Because -- well, that's one thing, but the other thing is, Your Honor, if I could talk about the ways that the proceeds definition just doesn't make sense here. If these expense payments - - the expense payments for instance, the payment of the salary that Mr. Santos made to Mr. Diaz -- it happens in this very case, although we didn't prosecute it as concealment money laundering -- that he recorded those payments as salary payments by a printing business that he owned. And he's doing that to conceal the activity, to enable it to keep going. And that's just what Congress was trying to get in the statute. Wouldn't be covered under a profits definition. If criminals concealed the gross receipts temporarily until they pay the expenses -- for instance, if a gambling operator takes the money that -- his illicit receipts from the gambling, and he puts it in the bank account of the printing business. And then later he uses it to pay the winning betters, he's doing that to hide it so the gambling operation can keep going. That's what Congress was trying to get at here. That wouldn't be covered. That -- that evades detection just as much as transactions that hide profit.",
  "Yes, it would, Your Honor. But the conduct, the concealment conduct - -",
  "-- the concealment conduct is additional conduct, and it is what Congress wanted to get at here, and a profits definition would mean that it is excluded from the statute. And it would exclude the - -",
  "Well, I guess if you don't think that concealing expense payments should be covered, if you don't think concealing money that is - -",
  "It's not a question of advertising them, Your Honor. It's not a question of advertising them, but it is a question of taking additional conduct to conceal them.",
  "It is additional conduct. He didn't need to record it on the books of the -- on the books of his printing business.",
  "It's additional conduct, but it's not designed to conceal the unlawful nature - -",
  "I might like to keep my money in the cookie jar -- and it's perfectly legitimate money, Your Honor -- because I don't want when someone comes into my house that -- for them to steal the cash.",
  "If he takes the money, Your Honor, and he structures his payments to his employees by making them -- or to his suppliers, by making them in $9,000 increments in order to evade transaction reporting requirements, that wouldn't be covered either under this interpretation of the statute.",
  "I think there are many situations, as the Chief Justice pointed out, in which a profits definition isn't going to be enough to solve it. For instance, just a drug dealer accepts payment for the drugs. If that money exceeds the cost of the business, it would presumably be profit and without some other requirement in the statute, it would count as money laundering. And for instance, when street-level dealers that are employed by a drug kingpin turn the receipts over to the kingpin even after they've take out their share, let's say -- under a profits definition if those receipts exceeded the costs of the business that would also be covered as money laundering. So I think it's very true that the profits definition isn't going to solve all the problems as well. That's a -- you know -- another point about it. It also means that what we have to prove profits that that's going to be very difficult for us to do even in cases that don't involve these expense payments because criminals often don't keep accounting records. They certainly don't keep records that are accurate and complete and decipherable by law enforcement. And Congress recognized the lack of hard evidence of criminal profits, and for that reason Congress provided for the forfeiture of proceeds rather than profits in the RICO and drug forfeiture statutes. And there's no reason to think Congress took a different approach here in the money laundering statute, two years later, when it used the same term \"proceeds.\" There's also -- there's the issue of the uncertainty that would be created by a profits definition, because it would raise all these questions, and there are no accounting rules to resolve them. And even the court below acknowledged that it's difficult to determine what is and isn't net income, and that the line between paying expenses and reinvesting that income is murky. And I don't think the Court should lightly assume that Congress intended a definition of an element of the offense that's going to raise these numerous issues about the scope of that essential element of the offense. And the Court is going to have to resolve them all without any guidance from Congress. So if I could reserve the reminder of my time.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you. If I could first address the reasons why this Court should not decide the separate transaction issue itself in this case. First of all, it's not the question presented here which is limited to the meaning of the statutory term \"proceeds.\" Respondents didn't present any alternative question in their briefs in opposition. And, in fact, they don't present an alternative question presented even in their briefs on the merits. They're just using the concern about merger as a reason to decide that proceeds means profit. The separate transaction issue was decided against Respondents adversely on direct appeal in the Febus case, as my brother on the other side acknowledged. And those kinds of issues that are decided adversely on direct appeal shouldn't be relitigated. The issue wasn't raised in the separate transaction issue, it wasn't raised in the Section 2255 issues, and wasn't addressed by the courts below in these collateral proceedings. At most, we say it should be left open for another case that presents -- that presents the issue. Beyond that, if this Court thought that something should be left open for the court below to address, the court below could address a range of possible ways to deal with ensuring a separation, for example, Justice Stevens's suggestion that an illegal gambling business under the statute itself entails the payment of winners and the payment of employees, although we don't think that it does. But a profits definition is not the way to address concerns about overlap for the underlying offense, because it makes no sense in the broader context of the statute. It would create significant uncertainty about the scope of the statute because of the absence of accounting rules. It would make proof very difficult as a general matter because of the absence of those rules and because criminals often don't keep accounting records. It would exclude numerous concealment transactions that Congress had no reason not to cover, and it would cripple the government's ability to prosecute professional money launderers, which are really a significant part of the problem that Congress was addressing. If the Court has no further questions, we would ask that the judgments of the court of appeals be reversed.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: ERISA authorizes a participant in a defined contribution plan to sue to recover losses to the plan caused by a fiduciary breach even if the losses are attributable to the participant's individual plan account.",
  "It's -- that's theoretically possible because the loss to the -- loss to this individual account is a loss to the plan. Although it's unlikely that a participant that has no -- that is - - whose own benefits are not going to be affected has much incentive to sue, and it's also possible that a court might conclude if such a participant did bring suit, that such a suit shouldn't proceed under prudential standing principles or because the suit wouldn't be appropriate, but here - -",
  "Well, we agree that a loss to any account is a threat to the plan as a whole, but I think for a different reason. We don't think that you could rob the other accounts to pay this -- this participant. That would likely violate the fiduciary's duty of loyalty to those participants, the fiduciary duty of prudence under -- under ERISA. It would also probably violate the terms of the plan, because they have a right to future benefits by the amount that's in their allocation but - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, but - -",
  "The implication is that the suit is against the plan or against a fiduciary in - - under (a)(1)(B). Against the plan or against the fiduciary whose initial capacity is representative of the plan.",
  "If you can't sue the fiduciary under (a)(1)(B), that just reinforces the point even - - even more, Your Honor, that Petitioner's cause of action here arises under (a)(2) because he is seeking relief for the plan not relief from the plan.",
  "Under (a)(1)(B), most courts require that the suit be brought against the plan. I think the suit in certain circumstances could be brought against the fiduciary to require the fiduciary to take action that is required by the terms of the plan such as if you fought against the fiduciary to pay benefits out.",
  "And if it's not a breach of fiduciary duties, Petitioner will lose on the merits or on remand in their motion for summary judgment based on facts that could be decided.",
  "It's a breach of fiduciary duty both of a failure to follow the terms of the plan and a breach of the duty of prudence, because when a plan provides that participants can direct their investments - -",
  "The case was dismissed on the pleadings, Your Honor, and it alleges that there was a breach of fiduciary duty. And Respondent hasn't disputed, in fact, that the plan requires participants -- allows participants direct, in fact - -",
  "Yes, but the inferences shouldn't be construed against the plaintiff in motion to dismiss on the pleadings, Your Honor. In addition to that, Respondent's answer - - this is on page 2a of the red brief -- admitted that participants in the DeWolff plan are permitted to direct the investment of their contributions to the plan. That's in paragraph eight on page 2a.",
  "That's certainly true, Your Honor. But here, the court of appeals assumed that there was a fiduciary breach. That's on page 3a in the star footnote of the -- it's the appendix to the petition for certiorari. There is no reason for this Court to second-guess that, particularly since Respondent didn't argue in its motion to dismiss that there was no fiduciary breach here. So the case comes to the Court on the assumption that there is a fiduciary breach. And these are very important questions concerning whether assuming there is a fiduciary breach, a participant in a defined contribution plan can sue to recover for the plan the losses to the plan that are caused by that breach when the losses are attributable only to that individual's account.",
  "We don't think that there is a claim at this point under (a)(1)(B), because the -- the money the Petitioner seeks -- what's happened here is he has alleged that there has been a fiduciary breach that caused a loss to the plan. The appropriate remedy for that is a recovery from the fiduciary in its personal capacity to put the money back in the plan. That's what section 502(a)(2) provides. Once the money is back in the plan and then it's allocated pursuant to the duty of prudence to the Petitioner's account, then if the plan didn't pay out the money to him when he was entitled to it, which he appears to be entitled to it now since he has withdrawn his account balance, he would have a 502 (a)(2) claim -- a 502(a)(1)(B) claim, excuse me -- but he doesn't have a claim under that provision now. We - - at least we think it's very unlikely that he does, because generally plans provide that the benefits that are owed to people are the money that are in -- in the account.",
  "That's right, and then he would -- it would be even clearer, I think that he has no (a)(1)(B) claim, if he didn't have -- say he was still participating in the plan and he wasn't -- he hadn't withdrawn his account balance and didn't have a right to withdraw his account balance at that time, then he wouldn't have a right to any benefits from the plan. The crux of the matter here is that the plan has suffered a loss and that the appropriate remedy is against the fiduciary in his personal capacity; (a)(1)(B) doesn't provide for suits against the fiduciary in his personal capacity to recover money for the plan. It provides, again, suits against the plan to pay money out of the plan. This money isn't in the plan; it can't paid from the accounts of other participants because it would breach these duties under ERISA. The appropriate remedy is to get the money back in the plan.",
  "No, because (a)(1)(B) provides an action for benefits from the plan and (a)(2) provides an action against -- it's a different -- against a different defendant for a different kind of claim.",
  "If it's a claim for benefits under (a)(1) or to enforce the terms of the plan, such as if the fiduciary says, \"I'm just not going to follow your instruction,\" and the participant wants a clarification of that and an order compelling the fiduciary in his official capacity to do that, yes, that would be a suit under (a)(1)(B) and there would be no suit under (a)(2). There's only a suit under (a)(2) if there are losses to the plan and if the remedy is to put the money back in the plan by getting it from the breaching fiduciary. If I could turn to (a)(3) just very briefly, Your Honor. We think that suits against fiduciaries to recover losses by fiduciary breaches are also authorized by section 502(a)(3), which provides for appropriate action, I believe.",
  "Yes, that's 1132(a)(3).",
  "Of the United States Code, 29",
  "Okay. I apologize. That - - that provision -- my time.",
  "That provision provides for appropriate equitable relief, and a suit against a fiduciary to recover losses caused by a breach of fiduciary duty seeks equitable relief because it's analogous to an action for breach of trust seeking the equitable remedy of surcharge. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Rule 32 requires the district court to provide notice before any departure from the Guidelines range based on a ground not previously identified by the PSR of the parties, including a departure based on the factors in section 3553(a). Non-Guideline sentences under section 3553(a) fall squarely within the term departure, both as defined in the dictionary and as defined in the Guidelines.",
  "First of all, as enacted rule 32(h) requires notice of all deviations from the Guidelines range, and by its plain terms it continues to do that. But - -",
  "Either way - -",
  "No.",
  "No. They were focused on Guidelines authorized departures because those were the only ones that were legally authorized at the time. But the fact is that they required notice of all -- that - - that -- that they were requiring notice of all deviations that were available. Now they should require notice -- at a minimum, rule 32(h) is still there and it continues to apply to traditional departures.",
  "Yes. It - -",
  "Well, yes. One of the -- they have, Your Honor. One of the things that the advisory committee stated that it was going to consider was - - was lower court decisions on the question -- on the question of whether notice -- the current text of rule 32(h) requires notice to be given. So that might have been one of the reasons that some people in the conference were reluctant to adopt an amendment. Another reason was that they knew that the courts were considering the question, and many people expressed concern that an amendment was premature, that the -- that the conference should await further guidance from the courts and from this Court.",
  "That's true. Some judges did object to that. But others -- as I said, there were other -- some judges expressed support for that interpretation, and there were varying reasons that were motivating different people in the conference to take the position that the conference should wait. The fact is -- and so the Court shouldn't construe from the failure to enact an amendment just like the Court is reluctant to construe from the failure to amend a statute that the current provision doesn't require notice.",
  "I don't think so, because they've -- they've referred it back to the subcommittee and said they want to wait and see what -- what this Court does and what the courts to. So, they're waiting for you. Doesn't seem like in that circumstance it makes sense for you to wait for them. But however you interpret the current rule -- and the question before you is what the current rule requires. However you interpret that it doesn't circumvent the rulemaking process - -",
  "No. I think that the pre-sentence report doesn't actually have to recommend it. The pre-sentence report -- and they generally have a section that does this although, although often they don't identify - -",
  "I mean, at a certain point it wouldn't, but if it listed more than one as a possible ones and they were identified with sufficient specificity to enable - -",
  "Yes. It -- it -- it certainly could, Your Honor. And the PSR here includes - -",
  "That's required. No. But what -- what it does show is that this is a possibility that an out of Guidelines sentence is a possibility and this is the ground on which it is a possibility. JUSTICE SCALIA? What if the ground is I just simply believe that the Guidelines' recommendation for arson when there are people in the building is simply too low? Okay? You give notice of that. What good is giving notice of that going to do? Is too low. Isn't too low. Is too low. Isn't too low. I mean - -",
  "The parties can - -",
  "The parties -- the parties would be able to focus on that and try to inform the judge's decision on that. But that's not the only kind of -- that's not the only kind of ground on which a court might vary, and that may not be one for which advance notice would be particularly helpful, but there are many on which it is. If I can give an example of a case we recently confronted, for example? We had a case in which a judge imposed probation on a defendant who was convicted of soliciting child pornography because the judge was under the belief that prison couldn't provide the necessary treatment. We hadn't presented any evidence on available treatment programs, but we certainly would have done that if we had had notice that the court was contemplating varying on that ground. And because we didn't do that, there was no adversary presentation of that.",
  "You could -- we could certainly do that. But that's an after the -- you know, that would be an after-the-fact situation. What -- what rule 32 is trying to do is set up a procedure so that in every case, in every case you get the adversarial presentation on the grounds - -",
  "Well, it's -- it's a context-specific question. The question is, is the notice reasonable, which means it has to give the parties enough time to present the adversarial process on the question. Now, in the vast majority, all but the most unusual cases notice a day or two in advance would be specific. And in many cases, notice that the hearing itself would be sufficient. I think in this case, for example, notice that the hearing itself would certainly have been sufficient; but -- but the - -",
  "Well, several reasons; for all the reasons, Your Honor, that we said that the -- that it's failure to give notice of a variance here was harmless. First of all, the PSR had already identified a possible departure on a very similar ground. Second of all, the Petitioner's future dangerousness was central to the victim impact testimony of his wife who had notice was going to testify. He knew from the PSR what she was going to say. In addition, it was central to dispute - - potential adjustment to the Guidelines' range. So, his future dangerousness was - -",
  "No, Your Honor. But I think in this circumstance, for example, there would be - - another example would be often if the victim impact testimony -- there hadn't been identified as a potential ground for departure on it, but the judge heard victim impact testimony, but the defendant knew the victim was going to testify, had the general sense it and the judge when it heard -- when she heard it decided, wow, you know, this really makes me think I should take it out of the sentence, I think that because the -- because the defendant knew that the testimony was going to be there, knew the gist of it and was prepared to respond to it, would probably be sufficient to give notice at that time then. For instance, if the judge relied on remorse in allocution -- lack of remorse in allocution that's another example where I think, you know, notice at the hearing would pretty much - -",
  "Well, judges - -",
  "The judges are reviewing the material. I don't think they are doing it a week in advance. They're getting the material a week in advance. They are reviewing it before the sentencing hearings. And the notice requirement has not been unduly burdensome for traditional departures - -",
  "No, they don't - -",
  "That -- it is true that they go into the hearing with an open mind, but it's also true that before the hearing, they're going to have some sense based on the written materials that they've reviewed and based on the parties' identifications of what they think the appropriate sentence is. As Petitioner's counsel explained, in the vast majority of cases, the PSR, the parties are already going to identify the potential grounds for a variance, and so it's very few cases that there's going to be a ground that's going to come out - -",
  "Well, at a minimum, the court would have to identify the relevant 3553(a) factor. I think then what more is required depends a little bit on the particular factor, the record in the case. Again, the test is to ensure that they focus adversarial presentation. If it's a really an open-ended factor, like the nature and circumstances of the offense and the defendant's characteristics, obviously more is going to be required.",
  "Here I think it would have been sufficient for the judge to say. I'm contemplating a variance under section 3553(a)(2)(C), based on the fact that Petitioner's conduct indicates that he is likely to commit future crimes.",
  "Yes. We don't think that notice of the specific fact on which the court is going to rely is required. That would start to make the notice requirement unworkable, but I don't think that's how it's been interpreted, to require the very specific facts in the departure context. The same situation, the parallel thing applies here. As I was going to say before on the burdensomeness, it hasn't been burdensome, unduly burdensome, to require notice for traditional, and there really isn't any reason to think that it would be different for here. And to get back to something earlier as well that we're were talking about, the key fact is rule 32(h) does indisputably require notice for traditional departures. And a notice requirement for variances is essential to prevent evisceration of that notice requirement because a court can always impose the same -- use a variance to impose the same sentence that it could have imposed as a Guidelines departure. So that notice requirement, which is still in the rule, is going to basically become meaningless unless the word \"departure\" is given it full scope and construed to include variances. And notices of variances is also necessary for the focused adversarial testing that rule 32 requires for the reason the Court said in Burns. If the parties don't know what the potential grounds for a non-Guidelines sentence are, then what they're likely to do is either address the possibility of an above-Guidelines sentence in a random and wasteful way by trying to conceive of every possible grounds or they're just not going to address it at all, like in the example that I gave before when we just didn't address the potential variance based on prison not providing - - being able to provide the appropriate treatment. And it's still important, even after Booker, to have adversarial testing of that issue.",
  "Well, what we would have liked to do is bring in people to explain to the judge these are the programs that are available. This is - -",
  "That's how it works. Well, I think the lawyer probably could have said we have -- we have treatments and they work. But then the judge said - -",
  "-- well, based on this - -",
  "Well, I think that what the judge thought was that there were no available treatments that would work. And it - -",
  "That -- you know, it might have dissuaded the judge there, but it didn't give us the opportunity to bring in somebody who - -",
  "-- who knows how it -- you know, who knows what the programs are, to explain it. Whatever the judge said, yes, I know you have these programs, but the programs that you can do in prison - - you know, I just don't think that those are effective. And - -",
  "But - -",
  "The judge is -- you know, counsel can make the argument. But in certain cases, the ability to present actual evidence on it is going to be an important -- is going to be an important factor. There's, you know, other examples: For instance, if the judge varies on grounds that there's no treatment available for other things or that people have been permanently psychologically scarred, and the other side wants to bring forward counter-evidence and -testimony. There are numerous ones. That's the -- that's the essence of what the requirement - -",
  "-- and the rules get at.",
  "Judges -- do judges bring in experts?",
  "We would have -- if -- I think that we would -- could bring in someone and testify about -- to present evidence on that for sure, if the judge was thinking of imposing probation because there was no treatment program. It wouldn't have to go on for very long, but we could have someone come in for a few minutes and -- and do that.",
  "Not routinely, but, you know, generally that's not an issue. That's why we didn't do it in this -- in this particular sentencing hearing. The point is that, you know, we're not going to do that. And so a judge that's operating under that and it's going to vary on that ground isn't going to get that information because we're -- as you say -- we're not going to just want to delay all the hearings for that reason. And so that -- it's really the reason that the requirement in the existing rule is there, and the reasons behind that apply with equal force in the variance context.",
  "Yes -- I mean, it's not the best -- it's not the best example to illustrate to the Court why notice is required because here we do think that the error was harmless for various reasons.",
  "Well, we think the Court should, you know, first obviously address the rule 32 question on which it granted certain certiorari, but after doing that, we think the Court should address the harmless error question because that will provide useful guidance to the lower courts. There are likely to be a lot of harmless error cases because half of the circuits have erroneously concluded that the rule doesn't require notice, and they could benefit from an illustration of how to apply it in this particular context - -",
  "-- involving variance.",
  "Well, I think this is an easy case for an appellate court to address because - -",
  "-- regarding whether the notice would be adequate - -",
  "Yes, but the questions about adequacy of notice are really no different in kind than the same questions that come up for the traditional departure rule. It's still going to be there, however this Court resolves the case for the notice of Guidelines departures. So I don't think that you're opening a - - whole new questions about adequacy, just as like you're not opening up a whole set of new questions about timing. Those questions are there, and the courts are going to have to confront them. But in discussing the harmlessness issue here, you could shed some light on those questions that can provide some guidance for the lower courts that will be useful to them in the future. And we would urge you to do that. Turning to the harmlessness, in addition to the fact that the PSR gave notice -- do you want me to continue?",
  "Sure. In addition to the fact that future dangerousness was central to sentencing, it's also true that the evidence that Petitioner now says he wouldn't have presented wouldn't have made a difference because his counsel essentially made the same argument to the district court, and he could have used the expert testimony to support that argument, but he chose not to. The District Court had already rejected the defense of expert diagnosis the Petitioner was delusional and could be treated with anti-psychotic drugs and adopted the government expert's diagnosis that Petitioner had a personality disorder that was longstanding and unlikely to change.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Failure-to-report escape qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA's residual clause because it creates a serious potential risk of physical injury that's comparable in both kind and degree to the risk that's created by the enumerated offense of burglary. Failure-to-report escape is similar in kind to burglary because it's purposeful, violent, and aggressive in the same way as burglary.",
  "Yes, Your Honor. Two points on that. First, escape and failure-to-report escape, other types of escape and recapture, are linked ed in a way that arrest and the typical crime aren't, because escape inherently avoids -- inherently involves the avoidance of custody and custody is the very obligation that recapture is trying to impose. But avoiding arrest isn't an element of the typical crime, so the connection between arrest and the ordinary crime isn't close enough to justify considering the violence in arrest -- in the arrest in whether the crime is violent. Also the risk - -",
  "Okay. What I'm saying is it's an element of escape that you're avoiding custody, and escape is a continuing offense and so it doesn't end until the avoidance of custody is over.",
  "It shows the close connection between the two. And so when you're -- when the offender is committing the crime, it's appropriate to hold him accountable for what he can see is so highly, closely connected to the crime and which, in fact, has to happen in order to end the crime; whereas - -",
  "Well - -",
  "To address the -- the passive point, deliberately failing to comply with your legal duty to report to prison is not -- it is not doing nothing, as Petitioner says. It's not purely passive. It is a criminal act.",
  "It's purposefully inviting the violent confrontation when the law enforcement officers come to terminate - -",
  "No. Because in -- in failure to respond to the traffic ticket the -- first of all, it's not clear that somebody is going to come after you and try to physically bring you in. Second of all, the offender isn't expecting them and on edge and prone to react violently. Third, he hasn't demonstrated already that he is unwilling to submit to custody. And the fact that - -",
  "No. I'm saying just the opposite of that. I'm saying that it's different because here you've got somebody who is expecting the police to come. He is looking over his shoulder all the time. He knows they know he didn't come to prison. He knows they know who he is. They probably know where he is. If he is sitting at home, they know where he is.",
  "This - -",
  "This offense that he was convicted of is failure to report to a penal institution, failure to report to prison.",
  "I think a probation violation is different -- different circumstances. It doesn't involve the same refusal to submit to custody that this offense involves, which - -",
  "I don't think you really need the statistics, Your Honor. I think it's a common - - it's common sense that the police are going to make vigorous efforts to recapture people who fail to show up to prison the way they are supposed to.",
  "Well - -",
  "When he was sentenced -- when he was convicted of escape, he was sentenced to six months in prison -- in jail, that was stayed; probation for 30 months, and he violated his probation and he ended up in jail for 5 years.",
  "No. He didn't just have to make up the weekends that he had lost.",
  "I know that, Your Honor.",
  "But I don't think that's accurate for the sentence for escape. On page 113 to 114 of this JA, Your Honor, which is the -- the PSR describing what happened for this offense, it says that he has 30 months probation. It's in the second volume, the volume under seal.",
  "You know, we are not supposed to be looking at the individual offender here. It's the categorical approach. But he had been convicted of robbery and aggravated battery, Your Honor. So he -- he is not somebody who has not done any violent crimes, either. And what's -- what's different is that he has now deliberately failed to comply with his legal duty to report. He has now deliberately resisted custody, so - -",
  "First of all, while he is out on the binge, people could be coming and looking for him and the violent confrontation could occur. Second of all, even if in the unusual case of somebody who comes in voluntarily hours late, a few days late, there wasn't a -- a risk of -- of violence, which we think there can be, but even if there was none, it wouldn't matter because you're applying the categorical approach here. And what you don't look at -- you don't look at the unusual case. You look at the elements of the offense in the ordinary case.",
  "I think generally the policy - -",
  "Well, Your Honor, he is -- he is looking at his whole - -",
  "I think generally that -- that they look at the conduct that's been committed and they -- that the policy is to charge the -- the maximum charges that are supported by what the -- what the defendant has done. But here you don't have - -",
  "I'm -- I'm not aware of that. I can't -- can't speak to the -- the fact that they would do that, Your Honor. But here you've got in the ACCA, you're got not one previous violation for escape; you've got three violent felonies that you have to have. And this was his third one with -- in addition to robbery and aggravated battery and in addition to distributing cocaine within a thousand feet of public housing. And so we are not talking about - -",
  "That's -- that's also incorrect, Your Honor. Two of the four cases that we cited in our -- in our brief, in our anecdotes, involved injury to innocent bystanders. It's true we didn't highlight that in the parentheticals to those cases, but it's on page 19, the -- we cite various cases, and we also then go on to cite some articles just as an example.",
  "We have those two examples. I mean, I haven't gone out and looked for other cases. Those are just two out of the four that we cited.",
  "In -- in addition to those, no. I -- I went to get some sample cases. I haven't gone to see if I could find more cases of those. In addition, in the Massachusetts data there are -- there are two of the 18. Admittedly, the sample is small in Massachusetts - -",
  "But it's 11 percent of the people violently resisted, and they were charged with assault and battery on a police officer. I think that that's indicative of possible injury. And in any case the question is - -",
  "Yes, Your Honor. And I think that the Sentencing Commission data also supports - - although, again, the -- the sample size is small. But the question here is: Is there a potential risk? And what the sentencing data shows for the failure-to-report escapees is that 7.1 - -",
  "We don't think that you should be looking at the statistics at -- at all, Your Honor. But -- and so -- I mean, you know, that's our -- our fundamental point is that -- that the ACCA requires a potential risk. The James case illustrates that you decide these cases without statistics.",
  "What James says is that you try to assess whether the degree of risk is comparable to the degree of risk presented by one of the enumerated offenses. And, as you did in James - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "I'm not saying that you should ignore the statistics, but the statistics are neither necessary nor dispositive. And I don't think the statistics cast any doubt on the commonsense conclusion based on some of the factors I was talking about before, about why there's a potential for violence during - -",
  "Well, I think James addresses that, Your Honor. And James says that in deciding whether you have a serious potential, you look to the enumerated offenses and you determine if they can be comparable.",
  "It has -- it has to be more than a potential. It has to be serious in the sense that it's similar in degree, comparable in degree, to one of the enumerated offenses.",
  "Okay.",
  "That's right. And - -",
  "It's a 3.1 percent -- 3.1 percent rate of having this dangerous weapon when he is being -- being taken into custody for -- for this offense. And, you know, looking at the -- at the failure-to-report people, which is what this person is charged of, of those 42 people, that was 7.1 percent of those people that had a weapon. And if one of those people had used that weapon, that would have been a 2.4 percent chance of injury. Now, I'm saying the sample size is small, and this shows why it's dangerous to put too much weight on it. But that would have been a 2.4 percent rate of injury. And in Tennessee v. Garner, this Court cited a statistic in the 1970s about the risk of violence during burglary. And this was household burglary, which you think might be likely - -",
  "Well, no, Your Honor. And I'm not criticizing it. I'm saying that you have to take into account the sample size and you have to take into account that there are - -",
  "Because my point is that - - take the 42 failure-to-report people, which is the offense here, okay. Three of them -- three of those 42, had guns. If one of those three had used the gun, that would have been a use of force, an instance of actual violence. That percentage -- I'm not -- I'm not questioning the statistical validity of anything. I'm taking it on its terms. That's a 2.4 percent statistic there.",
  "3.8 percent in -- in household burglary. So I just think that -- that the statistics are -- are very low, the risk of actual violence in burglary as well.",
  "Well, Your Honor, the statute again talks about the potential risk. It doesn't talk about the actual use of force or the actual injury. The actual use of force is covered by clause one - -",
  "No. But I think the drunk driving -- that what concerned the Court about drunk driving was that the crime is a strict liability crime. It didn't involve deliberate conduct. This conduct is purposeful. Petitioner doesn't -- doesn't contest that. And the situation here is a different kind of risk. It's like the risk in burglary. It's the deliberate commission of the crime despite the clear risk of an ensuing violent confrontation. And so, the parallel, there really isn't a parallel to the strict liability crime there, where the injury -- the Court said in Begay there is a serious risk of injury. The problem is that the crime is just not purposeful, so it doesn't show this willingness to harm others.",
  "Yes, Your Honor. But you have to -- you have to talk about the violent conduct in context. And what it said is that all these enumerated crimes are violent crimes. But burglary is violent not because the violence is some element of the offense. There is nothing about the elements of the offense that's violent. What makes burglary violent is the fact that the offender deliberately commits it, even though he knows it could trigger this violent confrontation.",
  "I think it's -- it's numerous things, but the avoidance of custody is sort of a categorical difference between this and all the other crimes, Your Honor. It's an element of this crime that he is doing that. That also factors into the fact that the risk of violence during recapture is going to be greater than the risk of violence in apprehending an ordinary criminal for several different related reasons. One - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. The Seventh Circuit thought that applying the purposeful, violent and aggressive requirement of Begay required a different result because it -- it thought that it meant that the crime had to involve violent conduct itself; and it didn't appreciate the point I was making before, that burglary doesn't involve that violent conduct itself, and that burglary is violent because of the prospect of the violent confrontation. And so, that's the -- that's what led the Seventh Circuit astray the second time around. But it --",
  "Yes. They did ask for -- for statistics. But I would stress again why we think that -- that looking to statistics as some kind of a requirement is, you know, both perilous and not required by the statute: One, because the statute requires just potential risk, not actual injury. Two, because these data are just generally not going to be available. And you don't have even the baseline for the other crimes, the enumerated crimes, really to compare it to. And so the result, if you start looking around for statistics and saying we need these statistics to do it, is that virtually no crimes are going to qualify under the residual clause. And obviously, that isn't what Congress intended when it adopted this broad residual clause.",
  "What -- we wouldn't sweep in any crimes based on arrest if the crimes don't themselves involve as part of the crime the avoidance of custody, because that shows the close link between the crime that I was explaining before. That's sort of the categorical difference, although I would agree with you, certainly, that in white-collar crimes in many cases the offender is going to submit voluntarily to custody; they are not even going to come after him. And he hasn't done anything to show his likelihood to resist in any way, and so there is going to be a significantly less connection there. Violent crimes where you might think that there is going to be a higher incidence are going to be covered based on the violence of the crime, anyway.",
  "Right. They are going to be covered already.",
  "So you know, one, we think there is a categorical difference between this kind of crime which has as an element avoidance custody, and all of the ordinary crimes that you're talking about. But even if you go and set that aside and don't draw that categorical line, and you look at, well, what's the risk of violence, here what you've got is you've got you know that they are going to come after him; he knows they are coming; he is already deliberately, he has already indicated his unwillingness to submit to custody; they know that; so they come prepared for resistance. And in Illinois he is by definition a recidivist felon if he has committed this crime, and those are characteristics that are particularly indicative of dangerousness. So we think this sets it quite apart from other crimes in terms of the risk of violence that -- that we are talking about.",
  "Not -- you know, how many could be covered altogether? Or - -",
  "Well I'm hopeful that the Court won't have to decide too many other cases with the guidance that will be given by Begay and James and now -- and now this case. So, you know, it has been -- this case, the Court took; it had been holding the case for Begay and it took it rather than vacating and remanding. So it's not as if this is a case where some conflict has developed after the Court was taken to resolve. We think - -",
  "I think a soldier that goes AWOL -- I mean, the soldier that goes AWOL does probably invite somebody to come after them. It's a little bit harder case here because he is not somebody who is a recidivist felon.",
  "Well, when he did it first - - he could have done it in his first crime. So you don't know when did this that he had the other two counting under the ACCA.",
  "Well, you don't look to the individual person; we're looking to the ordinary case and we know from the elements here that you have a recidivist -- you have a recidivist felon. I do think that there is a risk of -- you know, there is a risk of violent confrontation when a soldier goes AWOL, Your Honor.",
  "I just don't think it's quite as -- as clear a risk as it is -- as it is here, but you know, I would have to say that there is some risk. Yes. The -- if I could just address something that Justice Kennedy had raised before about statutes unlike Illinois's statute that has a -- that generally prohibit escape. One -- one possible problem that could arise from a holding that offenses like failure to report are not violent felonies is that a statute that broadly covered escape, the result would be that jail break escapes would not be violent felonies under that statute, because the statistics that are out there suggest that 89 percent of all escapes are either walkaways or failure to report. And so unless the charging document specifically charged it as a jail break escape, then the general -- something that was charged under the general escape statute would not qualify for coverage under the ACCA. And aside from that, if the Court has no further questions, we could ask that the judgment of the Court of Appeals be affirmed.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Federal law does not require automatic reversal of a conviction because the denial of a peremptory challenge at most violated only his State law rights. And even if his Federal constitutional rights had been violated, harmless error review would apply. The Constitution does not give criminal defendants the right to peremptory challenges; therefore, a -- the right of a State defendant like Petitioner to exercise peremptory challenges derives entirely from State law, and when erroneous denial of a preemptory challenge deprives him only of State law right, and when the State law rights alone have been violated, State law not federal law dictates whether harmless error review applies. The violation of a State law right doesn't rise to a due process -- federal due process violation unless it deprives the defendant of a fair trial. And this Court has repeatedly held that States can withhold preemptory challenges entirely without impairing the right to an impartial jury or a fair trial. It, therefore, follows that the erroneous denial of a single preemptory challenge does not render a trial fundamentally unfair.",
  "We'd still thing that that would not be a federal constitutional violation, and even if it were some kind of a federal violation, that it would be subject to review for harmlessness. If the trial court could violate due process, if its actions so skewed the balance of power over the selection of the jury in favor of the government that it resulted in a fundamentally unfair trial, but even the denial of multiple preemptory challenges wouldn't rise to that level.",
  "The question there would be whether that so skewed -- the test that I said before. I think the question would be that that's so skewed about - -",
  "I don't -- I don't think that the answer is clear at all. The State might rationally conclude that because the government has to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, because it has to convince the jurors unanimously to rule in its favor and because it has no right to appeal an unfavorable determination by the jury, that the prosecution should be entitled to more preemptory challenges. Of course, this case doesn't - -",
  "It's unlikely to, but - -",
  "Well, we don't think it's unconstitutional at all, Your Honor, but it is contrary to what the common practice and the way things have been approached in both the federal and State court.",
  "Well, I think that rests on the mistaken premise that harmless error now just turns on the predilections of the particular decisionmaker or on speculation about what one particular juror would have done differently than another. In fact, harmless error -- the harmless error inquiry looks at the hypothetical objective rational juror. And so, that's what you look at and the difference between - -",
  "But -- but that is not an appropriate part of -- of a harmless error analysis just like the fact that the jury might engage in nullification is an appropriate part of the harmless element. If -- in Strickland, which is the best case, I think, to explain how that is irrelevant to the inquiry, even though it's part of the constitutional there -- analysis there, the Court very clearly explains that you don't look at the particular decisionmaker, you don't speculate about nullification and about arbitrary action and the like, it sort of transferable over. That's just not an appropriate part -- analysis.",
  "Well, we think that the correct inquiry in this circumstance, given the nature of the right, is to ask whether the error resulted in the seating of a juror that was not impartial. And then you look at the record in the case, the voir dire record, and make that determination, and the government bears the -- bears the burden of proof. So we don't think that that would be difficult to do, Your Honor.",
  "That -- that -- that could be, but - -",
  "Well, I think we are respecting its fundamental -- its fundamental purpose, Your Honor, which is to assist to help achieve the goal of selecting an impartial juror.",
  "Generally for errors like the error you described before, where the judge erroneously -- mistakenly excuses a juror in the belief that the juror is disqualified for cause, where the judge mistakenly substitutes a qualified alternate for one of the jurors, or the judge places one alternate on the jury instead of another, the courts have generally looked at that for harmlessness and has not required automatic reversal. Indeed, even in the case of jurors that don't satisfy - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. And even in the case of jurors that don't meet the statutory requirements in the federal courts of appeals have held that unless a biased juror sits, a new trial is not required.",
  "The harmless error analysis, there are sort of a lot of different scenarios of types of violations, and the standard that they use is not clear in all of them. In the ones that -- the cases that I found that involve the seating of jurors that don't meet the federal statutory requirements, usually they involve felons that didn't reveal that they were felons, the courts have looked to the biased juror standard. Some courts have done that, others have looked to whether it affects the verdict. They haven't been exactly clear how you determine that, but - -",
  "Well, I -- I think that - - that even if you had a standard that said to look to whether there was an effect on the verdict, you can tell precisely the way the Illinois Supreme Court applied Neder here, if no rational jury could have acquitted, then you know the substitution of one rational, impartial juror for another didn't have an effect on the outcome. And that doesn't violate the Sixth Amendment to do that, Your Honor, because the underlying right - - the underlying error doesn't violate the Sixth Amendment.",
  "No, Your Honor. As Justice Ginsburg pointed out before, the Petitioner here got a determination of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on every element of the offense from a fair and impartial jury that was properly instructed. So we are not having a judge substitute that at all.",
  "That is true. But the Sixth Amendment doesn't give the defendant the right to any particular jury, it doesn't give the defendant the right to a jury that has been selected in compliance with every jot and frivolous State law. And therefore, if the underlying error, as the underlying error here where you get a denial of preemptory, where a juror is seated that even though that violated state law, assumably here, that -- that that doesn't amount to a Sixth Amendment violation. And if the defendant got his Sixth Amendment rights at trial, then the way you conduct harmless error review can't violate his Sixth Amendment rights. He already got them. And so it can be done and it doesn't violate the Sixth Amendment.",
  "Well, I -- we would obviously like to have sort of alternative rulings that do both, but I think the most logical way to approach the case is to decide whether there was a violation of the Constitution here, and because there wasn't one, to say that State law governs the harmless error analysis.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Additional time granted for preparation of pretrial motions is automatically excluded from the Speedy Trial Act deadline for commencing trial. For three reasons, that time falls under section 3161(h)(1) which excludes delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant. First, Section (h)(1) excludes delay resulting from various listed proceedings and other proceedings that are analogous or ancillary to those proceedings. A court's grant of additional motions preparation time is ancillary to pretrial motions themselves, which are a listed proceeding. It facilitates the motions because adequate time to prepare them is critical to their fair and accurate resolution. The exclusion is similar to other excludable delays that result from proceedings ancillary to listed proceedings.",
  "Yes, the time from September 7th to October 4th.",
  "Well, the delay is just the time that's being used for preparation, which was presumably the time all the way up to the period at which the waiver of the intent to file motions was filed.",
  "Well, I think the act - -",
  "Well, that's -- that's a result of the fact that the act doesn't exclude the time before a routine deadline for filing the motion, because it only excludes the time -- the delay resulting from an individualized proceeding. But it makes sense not to exclude the -- the time before the routine deadline as a general matter, because if you excluded all that time, then you -- the result would be that the basic deadline of the act would be extended and time would be excluded in cases where no time was being used for consideration or preparation of pretrial motions. But once you know - -",
  "The time running from the order of the district court granting additional time.",
  "There were - -",
  "The request -- the request for time, that proceeding was done. But the order -- the order granting additional time is a proceeding, and the additional time that - -",
  "The order -- an order is a step in the case, an act of the court - -",
  "-- and it's a proceeding.",
  "And it's - -",
  "Yes, but it's the delay resulting from the order that we are talking about.",
  "Yes.",
  "I think courts have excluded from the filing of a motion seeking an examination, yes. You could also, that would probably be excluded under (h)(1)(D) - -",
  "Right.",
  "I don't think so, Your Honor, because the delay resulting from the examination would -- would be excluded from the order granting the examination until the examination was complete. And then there would be a determination of competence or incompetence.",
  "I don't -- I think that that's -- that that's a different -- a different deferral, Your Honor. It's not for the court's consideration of a plea agreement or even for negotiations. It's saying we're going to take time out so that the defendant can demonstrate his -- his good conduct. I think that the plea agreement provision is once the parties have proposed an agreement to the court, the court has time to consider whether it should approve that and that time's excluded. And in fact courts have excluded the time that the parties are engaged in plea negotiations as ancillary to that provision of consideration of the proposed plea agreement.",
  "I'm not sure. If you think that the -- that there's delay that results from the grant of the extension, I don't think that the Petitioners ever challenged the length of the delay that was excluded, so the only issue that's before the Court is whether that delay is excluded. I don't know that the Petitioners preserved any argument about the length of the delay, Your Honor.",
  "I'm not sure that we lose. I have to confess that I haven't calculated the -- the exact amount of time that that results. In any case, there are other periods of delays - -",
  "Yeah. I'm sorry, Your Honor.",
  "Right. I guess I would say, if there was some question about the length of delay, the appropriate thing would be to -- to rule for us on the issue that's before the Court, remand to the courts below, allow them to decide whether the Petitioners preserved the question about the length of delay and what the effect is on a rule that would only limit the additional delay. You know, we also have other arguments for the fact that we think that, even if this time isn't excluded, that, based on -- based on the additional preparation time, that there's still no Speedy Trial Act here, that we raised in the -- in the brief of -- in opposition, and we would think that that should be taken into account on any remand like that as well.",
  "Because the -- on September 25th, Petitioner filed a notice of intent to waive pretrial motions, and then there was a hearing on that on the 4th, and so that filing would be analogous to a motion or a motion that would trigger it's own delay, that it would trigger it's own exclusion of time even if the time starting on September 7th was not excluded.",
  "The -- the court had originally said -- the court had originally provided in its order that on the deadline for filing motions the - - the Petitioner should either file the motions or indicate whether he wanted to waive the motions and then set a hearing on either one, on the 4th, and that's what happened. After he filed that paper on the 4th, the court held a hearing, and the defendant -- discussed with the defendant personally whether he wanted to waive his right to file motions.",
  "And the defendant waived his right to file motions, which had a consequence, you know, in the case. The second reason that the additional time granted for preparation of pretrial motions is automatically excluded is that the exclusion in Section (h)(1)(D) for delay resulting from pretrial motions themselves excludes the time that a court grants the non-moving party to prepare a response. And, as Justice Ginsburg, in her questions suggested, it would make little sense automatically to exclude time granted to respond to motions, but not the time granted for the specific purpose of preparing them. In fact, this Court employed similar reasoning to that in the Henderson case when it held that the Act excludes the time after a court has held a hearing on a motion while the court's awaiting further written submissions. The Court reasoned that it would make no sense not to exclude that time because the act excludes all the time before the hearing, as well as 30 days after a motion's taken under advisement; and likewise it would make no sense not to exclude time that is specifically granted to prepare motions when the Court excludes the time granted to respond to them. Third - -",
  "Well, section -- Section (h)(1), Your Honor, expressly states that it excludes delays, including, but not limited, to the listed delays, so no negative inference arises from the fact that the listed examples don't specifically address delays resulting from the grant of additional motions preparation time. Section (h)(1)(D) is addressing a related, but different delay, the delay from the pretrial motion itself.",
  "Because Congress specifically amended it in 1979, in response to previous interpretations by some courts that had excluded only the time that was spent in actual court hearings, and the language makes clear that all the time from the filing of the motion through the hearings, including the -- not just the Court hearing time -- is excluded, and it -- the language continues to -- to make that clear, even if preparation time is also sometimes excluded.",
  "No. I don't think that there are statute of limitations problems, Your Honor, but requiring judges to make superfluous ends of justice findings - -",
  "Well, a court should always be doing that in considering whether to grant additional time that's requested, Your Honor. Neither the defendant nor the public is going to have an interest in rushing to trial without adequate time to prepare - -",
  "The -- the judge doesn't have to give him the additional time. Presumably, the judge should only give him the -- the additional time if more time is needed to prepare the -- the motions, based on the justification that the defendant - -",
  "Well, what - -",
  "The judge has to specifically consider all of the specified factors that are in (b)(1) through (4).",
  "Well, the court -- the statute says that the judge shall consider the specific factors, and some courts at least have -- have reversed -- if a -- situations where the court hasn't considered the factors. In addition, there have to be specific ends of justice findings, which I would respectfully disagree with counsel on the other side: The findings have to be made before the continuance is granted. What - -",
  "What Zedner says is the findings have to be made before the continuance is granted. They can be recorded later, but they have to be made, because otherwise the continuance isn't made on the basis of the findings. So if the judge didn't go through, consider the factors, and make the findings, if only in the judge's mind, then the judge shouldn't be recording them later on.",
  "Is recorded. I guess -- I guess not, Your Honor.",
  "Yes, Your Honor. The -- the act just doesn't operate so that -- so that all the districts' excludable delays are even across districts. The exclusion in Section (h)(1)(D), the exclusion for pretrial motions, excludes the time that's allotted to prepare responses. And there is wide variation among the different districts in the time that's allotted to prepare responses. So, for example, the Northern District of Florida gives 14 days after the motion. The Northern District of Illinois gives ten days after the motion.",
  "For response time.",
  "It's going to be different.",
  "So it's the same -- it's the same issue. They're just -- it isn't in lockstep.",
  "Well, this is specifically authorized by Congress, too, because section (h)(1) is -- is a general exclusion for delay resulting from proceedings concerning the defendant. And, you know, these are -- the list of things are examples only. And this covers those proceedings and other proceedings, including those that like this one that are ancillary to the listed ones.",
  "I think it depends on the particular case and what motions are in -- or what motions are involved, Your Honor. But the -- the rule is going to operate differentially, too. Under Petitioner's theory, people come in asking for different extensions of time to get (h)(7) continuances, which Petitioner says are not going to be very difficult to get granted. So I think, both in terms of the response time varying and in terms of the rule having the same effect, whether it's excluded under (h)(1) or (h)(7), I'm not sure that you are going to ever get a complete parity. That's really not what Congress was intending.",
  "That's the way the courts have interpreted it, because once the -- once the determination has been made that there should be time to prepare a response, then you know that you're outside of the case where you don't know whether any of this time in the routine deadline is being used for response - - for consideration of motions or preparation of motions. You know that counsel is using time for that purpose. But I would say, you know, the same answer back to you, that -- that the issue here is whether additional time should -- is excluded when it's granted. The issue isn't how much time should have been excluded. And if -- if the court thinks that an incorrect amount of time has been -- was calculated as excluded, I think that the appropriate thing to do in that circumstance would be for the Court to leave that open on remand, assuming that it's -- that it's preserved. But, you know, I think that -- that - -",
  "That's right, Your Honor. I -- Petitioner never argued, at least as far as I am aware, that the error was a miscalculation of the amount of time, rather than the exclusion of the time under the wrong statutory provision.",
  "On the 25th.",
  "As I was saying before, what -- he did make a filing on the 25th, and the Court took action in response to that filing on the 4th, by holding a hearing at which he waived the motions as he indicated that he was doing on the -- on the 25th. So - -",
  "Well, in this particular instance, Your Honor, he made a filing and then the Court -- the Court held a hearing in response to that, and actually engaged in a colloquy with the defendant, asked the -- asked the defendant, \"Do you understand what you are giving up? Do you want to waive these motions?\" He said, \"Yes, I want to do that,\" and the Court ruled, then, on that on the 4th.",
  "I don't think it's a general practice, Your Honor. It does seem to be typical in this -- in this district, but I think that - -",
  "Well, it was in fact a waiver notice, a notice of intent to waive, that the defendant filed. Not just - -",
  "Well, I mean, it was framed as a waiver, a waiver of pretrial motions. It's Docket Entry 21. But I don't think it's -- you know, it's in the record, but not in the -- in the JA.",
  "That -- that's true, but the Court didn't -- the Court held the hearing on the 4th. And it engaged in this conversation with the defendant and then made a decision on the 4th that the time was waived, that the -- the waiver, not - -",
  "Not at the time it was filed.",
  "I think that the - -",
  "It comes under -- it probably comes under (h)(1), Your Honor.",
  "I mean, it could come under (D), Your Honor. It could come under (h)(1). I would say it really comes under both -- best fits under (h)(1) as analogous to a motion that's not exactly a motion. But, you know, either way, the point is that it was something that the Court required the Court action, or at least as the Court had set the rules in this proceeding required Court action, and then it did ultimately did have Court action on the Court.",
  "I think just under -- I would say, Your Honor, just under the general language of (h)(1), because it's not strictly a pretrial motion, but it's the equivalent of a pretrial motion. But you could say that it falls under - - under (h)(1)(D), and think of it as a motion itself.",
  "I couldn't say precisely, Your Honor, but it is the rule that's been followed in eight courts of appeals.",
  "No. That's true. That's true. I mean, I can't say that they are going to be - - and I would have to agree with -- with Petitioner's counsel that, you know, that there are consequences in whatever ruling that the Court -- that the Court makes in a case.",
  "Yeah.",
  "I'm sorry, I don't have any precise -- precise information on that. But I think that, you know, even apart from the transitional effects that there are going to be on a going-forward basis, sometimes judges are going -- would -- would grant additional preparation time and neglect to make the required finding.",
  "That's right - -",
  "And that would be perfectly appropriate if findings under (h)(7) were necessary. But section (h)(1) is designed to address frequently recurring situations in which the ends of justice are virtually always going to be served by delaying the trial for the purpose. And that's exactly what we have here.",
  "No, we -- we agree with that, Your Honor. That's why Petitioner is wrong in saying that (D) addresses the delay we are talking about here and precludes its recognition under -- under (h)(1). The delay we are talking about here is not resulting from the pretrial motion, it's resulting from the grant of -- the order granting additional time to prepare for the motion. And that, that is the related but different proceeding and a different kind of delay related to motions practice. So I would agree with Your Honor that - -",
  "That the order granting the additional time of the proceeding - -",
  "-- and if the delay results from that order and the order is ancillary to a listed proceeding, which is the pretrial motions because it facilitates that proceeding, because it provides for adequate preparation, which enabled the motions to be resolved favorably and accurately.",
  "I'm sorry, Your Honor.",
  "Right.",
  "It's (h)(1), the general provision, which courts have used to exclude numerous - -",
  "No. It's a -- another proceeding that -- that is covered by the including but not limited to language on - -",
  "-- (h)(1).",
  "Well, I think (h)(1) says any period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant. That could be a period, and it covers a whole range of proceedings that generate delay. And then - -",
  "Then there is a list of examples. And the examples are intended only to be illustrative. And what's -- what's covered is in addition to those examples, other proceedings that are analogous or ancillary to them.",
  "That is the proceedings beforehand, Your Honor. Yes. But the -- that's not the -- you know, first of all, as I said, a proceeding is a -- is an act done by the court or under the court's authority, so in order to fit squarely within that. Plus I would direct you to (h)(1)(F), which indicates that orders can be proceedings here because it excludes delay following an order of removal or an order directing the transportation of the defendant. And, so, I think that there's indication in the examples themselves when orders are sometimes proceedings.",
  "It -- there -- there would be an order, so there would be a proceeding. But it wouldn't be a proceeding that would be covered under (h)(1) because it -- to be covered it has to be a proceeding of the type that is listed here. It has to be analogous to these proceedings or ancillary to them, facilitating these proceedings in some way, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a plan administrator has abused its discretion in construing plan terms, courts are not required to defer to the plan administrator's fallback interpretation of the same terms. That rule follows from trust law, and a contrary rule would undermine ERISA's protections for plan participants. It would reduce incentives for administrators to interpret plans reasonably; it would discourage participants from challenging unreasonable benefit denials; and it would make employers less likely to draft clear plans.",
  "If you don't think it's the same terms, that would present a -- a different question about whether deference was required. But still deference would have been inappropriate here, because the fallback interpretation by the plan administrator presented the same notice problems that the original phantom account interpretation had provided, because the summary plan description didn't provide notice that there would be an appreciated offset. But the rule that the court of appeals adopted was that deference was not required when it was the same terms, and the court of appeals found that. I don't think this Court needs to -- in resolving that, to decide whether it was the same terms here. We think it -- it was, because the -- the Petitioners made two argument in defending their initial benefits determination. One was we can apply the post-1998 terms, and the other one was, even applying the 1989 plan, that authorizes use of the phantom account, because of the non-duplication of benefits provision. And now they have come back on remand and they’re saying well, no, we’re now reading the non-duplication of benefits provision differently. And that's the -- that’s the same plan terms.",
  "No. We --",
  "We think there would be no difference on B if it was just a second reading of the same -- of the same term. Under that logic --",
  "You want the administrators to give their most reasonable interpretation, but under the logic of letting them be able to put the first interpretation there, they could just put a list of 10 interpretations --",
  "-- starting with the one that’s most favorable.",
  "Then a court might choose to defer if it thought there was no reason to think that there was -- that there was a reason to suspect that they're just trying --",
  "No, they wouldn't have to find bad faith.",
  "The standard would be --",
  "Ordinarily, if we are talking about they have put forward an interpretation, now they want to put forward a fallback interpretation, generally, if -- generally, if they have -- haven't put that forward before, we think that deference wouldn't be appropriate, because they had the opportunity to address the issue, and the unreasonableness of the initial interpretation suggests that they may not act reasonably on remand. And --",
  "No. According --",
  "According --",
  "That's right, and -- but there are -- there are concerns here about undermining ERISA's protections for plan participants that --",
  "That's right. Because ERISA requires the summary plan description to identify any circumstances that will result in an offset, to describe the offset in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant, and not to minimize the significance of the offset.",
  "Well, I don't --",
  "I don't know that the -- that the court of appeals actually found that the first time around. Our point is that that was the consequence of the lack of notice that was in -- in the summary plan description.",
  "Well, I -- we -- we think in most cases, it would have been an abuse of discretion for the district court in light of the lack of notice in the summary plan description to apply an appreciated offset. But the district court also did consider the reasonable expectations of the plan -- plan participants, and there might have been other countervailing considerations that could have been advanced by the -- the plan administrator, perhaps, about the financial solvency of the plan or some other matters, but -- but those weren't presented here. The point is that, once the court -- when the court remanded, the first task for the district court on remand was to look at the plan terms because this was a benefit action, determine whether those plan terms addressed how to calculate the offset, but here, the court couldn't rely on the plan terms, really, for two reasons. First, as the district court said, the plan said virtually nothing about how to do it; and, second, the point that I was making before, ERISA prohibited the court from adopting an interpretation that provided for more than the -- an offset greater than the face value.",
  "In the --",
  "If the plan -- if the plan terms -- in an ordinary case, if there was an abuse of discretion in interpreting the plan terms, the plan terms would still address the issue. There wouldn't be an additional violation of ERISA's notice requirement. This is a unique case, in the sense that, here, you’ve got not just an arbitrary -- an unreasonable interpretation of the plan terms, but you've also got the problem of the lack of notice in the summary plan description, and you've also got the problem that the plan terms are really silent on this issue. They just don't say anything about how to calculate the offset.",
  "I don't think it's a windfall, Your Honor, because it depends on what the employees were promised when they were deciding whether to come back.",
  "Well -- first of all, when you’ve got a defined benefit plan and defined contribution plan, there’s no requirement in ERISA, and employers frequently -- or at least, sometimes, would not offset the defined contribution benefits from the defined benefit plan, and even in a floor­ offset arrangement, where they would, an employer could provide less than the full amount --",
  "Oh, God.",
  "Well --",

  "No, Your Honor, we don't think so. In terms of the -- of the direct cause part, which it will be -- the significant limit on private actions, as this case illustrates, the district courts even accepting the allegations in the plaintiff's complaint will often be able to dismiss the suit on the pleading for its failure to satisfy that test.

It would allow thing like masterminds in the United States engineering international boiler room schemes in which they direct agents in foreign countries to make fraudulent representations that victimize investors.",

  "Yes, the -- the -- the private litigants are -- have numerous elements that they have to show that the SEC doesn't have to show: Reliance, loss, loss causation. All of those go to the causal link between the injury and -- and the fraud. And we think that the direct injury requirement is an appropriate application of those more general causation requirements in the context of transnational fraud.",

  "No, Your Honor. And we would certainly prefer that you decided the case solely on the private right of action if the alternative for a holding substantive prohibitions didn't apply here.",
  "Yes.",

And that's true for three reasons. First, the text of the student exemption makes clear that it's not a broad exclusion for apprenticeships and other learning jobs. Instead, it's a narrow exemption that applies only to students performing services for a school, college, or university where they're enrolled and regularly attending classes. And, second, when employees are working long hours and being paid substantial amounts, they and their employers should be helping to fund the Social Security system, and they should be earning credit towards benefits so that they and their families will have something to fall back on if they become disabled or die.",
  "It's probably both, Your Honor, but it's not workable to determine student status by looking in a particular case whether the predominant motive or the motive of the employee or the employer is education. People who -­",
  "I think they're doing it for both -- for both reasons, Your Honor. But many, many individuals pursue their jobs for the primary purpose of learning, like judicial law clerks, like other apprentices. But they're not excluded -- they're not covered by this exemption.",
  "Because they don't work at schools, colleges, and universities, and they, you know, may not be enrolled and regularly attending classes. And so the Treasury reasonably concluded that because this isn't a general exemption for apprenticeships, that they shouldn't construe it as providing a special exemption for apprentices who happen to be employed by schools, colleges, and universities. And -­",
  "Yes. If they would -- if their work -- I mean, here, basically, they have work, and the argument is that that work qualifies them as students. And what the -- what the Treasury Department has concluded is that it's going to treat work and study as distinct categories in deciding whether somebody is predominantly a student, and that it's not going to count the work as study even if there's some educational component to it. And that's reasonable for several reasons, as I said. First, because the statute just isn't a general provision that's designed to cover apprenticeships. And, second, because when people are primarily workers and they're working for long hours, they should be covered and participating in the FICA system. And, finally, it -- it would be very difficult to determine on a case-by-case basis what's their purpose, what the employer's purpose. You know, is this job more like study? Is this job more like work? And on that basis -- and to, on that basis, decide whether that should make them a student. So considering all of those things, the Treasury has decided to draw a bright line and say: Study is study; work is work; and if you're not a student independently of that, then your work doesn't make you a student. And the Treasury has also decided that if you're working full-time, that then you're predominantly an employee rather than predominantly a student, and you're not covered by the exemption. In addition, FICA's historical development indicates that the student exemption doesn't cover medical residents, because at the same time that Congress enacted the student exemption, it also enacted a separate exemption for medical interns, and it decided not to include residents in that exemption. And those actions would have made little sense if the student exemption had the scope asserted by Petitioners. And then, in 1965, Congress repealed the intern exemption in order to give young doctors an earlier start in building up Social Security coverage. And that repeal also wouldn't have achieved its purpose if many and most residents were covered -- were excluded from FICA under the student exemption. These -- these residents are people. They're working between 50 and 80 hours a week. They're working over a long period of time, and they're providing critical patient care with minimal supervision.",
  "Well, the rule is that the paid work doesn't count towards student status, and it wouldn't -- it doesn't count whether you're doing it for 4 hours, for 10 hours, or for 40 hours. So, in a circumstance where they're only being paid -- they're only working for paid time for a certain amount, that then that work -- you would have to look there, I -­",
  "If you accept the classification in your hypothetical of two hours -­",
  "-- and the other eight hours? But those -- that other work wouldn't necessarily qualify as a course of study, either, Your Honor. I mean, if what they're doing is providing services but providing -­",
  "No, not necessarily, Your Honor. What -- the Treasury regulations define what a class is and what a course of study is, and the -- the individuals have to be engaging in that to qualify as students and performing -- giving somebody something of value.",
  "Clinical work can qualify as a course under certain circumstances. But the clinical work that medical students are doing, if you're referring to that, is of an entirely different order than the work -­",
  "Yes, it's clinical work, but it's -- but it's very different than the work that the residents are doing. First, there's the distinction that the residents are getting paid and that the medical students are paying tuition. But, secondly, from that the residents are providing valuable patient care. Medical students are primarily participating in the clinical activities solely in an educational capacity. And I can -- if I can describe the different things that they're doing.",
  "They're not getting paid for it.",
  "It -- it might be a course, Your Honor, but they're also engaged in other classes and other activities that make them regularly enrolled, and it's part of a degree program. So it's one small -­ the clinical course is one small part of that.",
  "I'm not resisting the proposition that clinical work can constitute a course. What I'm saying is that when you're -- when you're being paid to provide services, that doesn't count as a course, because the IRS has decided to treat work and study as distinct categories in -- in applying this exemption, and that that's a perfectly reasonable distinction. Nothing in the statute precludes them from doing that, and Petitioners concede that -- that it's reasonable to interpret the statute as limited to individuals that are predominantly students.",
  "No, Your Honor, they're not. First of all, under the IRS's regulations, the IRS defines schools, colleges, and universities to include only institutions whose primary function is the provision of formal instruction. And, second of all, if -- on J.A. 27a, in the record in this case, there's an example of residency programs that are not students. The -- one of the hospitals that -- the Hennepin County Hospital that has University of Minnesota residents also has its own residents. And just looking on page 27a, if you have the J.A., there's a question: Do the Hennepin County residents -- are they enrolled in any academic institution that you are aware? Not at the present time. So, that is an example of one, Your Honor. And that does point out an anomaly about Petitioners' interpretation of the exemption. Medical residents who work for hospitals that are operated by schools, colleges, and universities would be exempt from FICA tax, but residents who work for other hospitals wouldn't be exempt, even though their work is equally educational. That's just an illustration of the broader principle that this isn't an apprenticeship exemption, and that's why, because of that, the Treasury has taken this approach to the situation where people are learning on the job.",
  "There's no -- there's no question, Your Honor. It's always been the Social Security Administration's position that medical residents are not students exempt from the Social Security Act. The Social Security Administration stated that in a Social Security ruling as far as back as 1978, and they continue to adhere to that position. In addition, as a practical matter, the way the Social Security Administration determines whether people get coverage for a particular period under the Social Security Act is they look at the W-2's that come in, and if FICA tax has been paid, then they put them down as being covered under the Social Security Act. So as a practical matter, it works that way as well. As I said before, these workers who are working between 50 and 80 hours a week over many years for substantial salaries are precisely the kind of workers whose employers should be supporting the Social Security system and who should be earning credit towards disability and survivor benefits. And we would ask that the judgment of the court of appeals be affirmed. Thank you.",
  "Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To accommodate important pretrial proceedings, the Speedy Trial Act contains several automatic exclusions from its deadline for commencing trial. This case concerns the exclusion for pretrial motions, which excludes the period of delay resulting from any pretrial motion from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on or other prompt disposition of such motion. For more than 30 years, the courts of appeals had uniformly held that the exclusion applies automatically upon the filing of any motion, regardless of its effect on the trial schedule. The court below correctly rejected that established rule, which accords with this Court's decisions, is clear and easy to administer, and has worked well for over 3 decades. The Court's cases construing the exclusion, Henderson and Bloate, support the established rule. They make clear that the exclusion applies automatically once a motion is filed without any need for district court findings. Henderson and Bloate cannot be squared with the approach of Respondent and the court below.",
  "No, Your Honor. Delay refers to the interval of time from the filing of the motion through its disposition, during which the Speedy Trial Act's deadline is tolled. We know that delay has the meaning -- delay can often have the meaning of the interval of time between two events. And we know it has that meaning in the statute here because subsection (D) tells us so. It defines the period of excludable delay resulting from the motion as the time from the filing through the disposition of the motion. Respondent's definition -­",
  "That's assuming that delay is referring to delay of the trial, to a postponement in the trial. But delay can't have that meaning because if it has that -- if that meaning is inconsistent with subsection (D) of the statute's exclusion of the time, of saying that delay is the time from the filing of the motion through the disposition of the motion, because the statute excludes periods of delay. And if delay meant postponement of the trial, then the excluded period would be the time during which trial is postponed, but that period is often significantly shorter or longer than the time from the filing of the motion to the disposition. And in Henderson and Bloate -­",
  "But, Your Honor, the statute excludes the period of delay, and then it says the period of delay is the time from the filing through the disposition. If delay -- if delay means postponement of the trial, then all that's excluded by the statute in the first part is the -- is the time during which trial is postponed, but that doesn't match up with subsection (D) because that period is not necessarily the period from the filing through the disposition. If I could give you an example. Say a motion is filed 14 days before trial could begin, and the motion takes 16 days to resolve. Trial is postponed only by two days. And so if delay means the postponement of trial, then the period of delay should be 2 days, but the statute says that the delay and the excludable time is the time from the filing through the disposition, which is 16 days. And that's what this Court held in Henderson and Bloate, that that's the exact time. So if you adopt a definition of delay for the first part as a triggering mechanism that's the postponement of trial, that doesn't line up with the rest of the statute. In addition, that would be a totally unworkable rule because whether time is excludable would turn on a complex and often uncertain analysis of whether the motion would or could delay when trial would begin, and it's often going to be difficult or impossible to make that determination at the time that the motion is filed.",
  "Yes, Your Honor. Sometimes trial -- judges might take motions into account in setting the trial date and other times they might not take the motions into account. So a rule that -- that said the exclusion only applies if the judge moves the trial date in response to the motion would lead to arbitrary results. It would mean basically that whether time was excludable depended on whether the judge took the motions into account when it set the trial date initially or whether the, whether the judge correctly estimated the amount of time. And also sometimes motions may be filed when no trial date is set, so the rule would be totally unworkable in that situation. And Respondent, in one of his formulations for what the test might be, suggests that a motion wouldn't create excludable delay unless it would postpone the hypothetical earliest date on which trial could otherwise begin. That's just a totally unworkable rule, because to divine that hypothetical date, courts would have to assess the effect of multiple different factors that could affect when trial would begin, such as: How much time do the parties and the counsel need for factual investigation and legal analysis? How long is discovery going to take? There would be numerous questions that would arise about how to apply those factors. For example, the courts would have to decide: Should they take potential obstacles to an earlier trial as given, or should they instead think about whether those obstacles could be eliminated? The courts would also have to figure out what to do if the earliest possible trial date changed between when the motion was filed and when the motion was resolved. And how would they take into account other periods of time that might exclude delay -- might exclude -- that might be excludable also? For example, say a court gets two motions filed at the same time. Trial could start in 5 days absent the motion. One motion's going to take 3 days to resolve; the other motion's going to take 4 days to resolve. What's the court supposed to do? Is one -- is the 3-day motion excluded? Is the 4-day motion excluded? Are both of the motions excluded? Does it depend on the order in which the court decides them? It just is not possible for a court to make these determinations.",
  "Well, I -- I can't point to anything particular, but there's been no outcry that -­ that there's been a problem from pretrial motions being filed as a -- as an attempt to extend the Speedy Trial Act deadline. The court's been -- the -- Congress has reviewed the Speedy Trial Act's operation in the past. It made changes in 1979 to address problems that have occurred. It hasn't felt the need to address this problem since, and there's no evidence of any abuse of the automatic exclusion on the other side.",
  "Well, first, Your Honor, I don't think that -- that Hood adopted any such rule. The motion -­",
  "It suggests that there might be that qualification. I think that the statute provides that the -- that any pretrial motion tolls the deadline, regardless of the purpose for which it's filed. But, of course, if -- in the unlikely event that a prosecutor did file a motion solely to extend the deadline and avoid proceeding to trial, that conduct would be sanctionable under -- under the Act, under section 3162(b)(4).",

It applies to any pretrial motion.

There's -- the problem just hasn't arisen.",
  "Well, the Court -- the Court does decline to address questions if it doesn't consider them of sufficient importance to -- general importance to warrant a review. Nobles is one example. There are others cited in Stern and Gressman. But the reason that this issue is not of any ongoing importance is that the rules have been amended.

In fact, courts frequently do that when they're trying to interpret statutes to figure out what the 10-day limit is/ as many of the -- many of the cases cited in the ALR article that Respondent cites show.",
  "Well -­",
  "Yes, Your Honor, generally the flights don't occur on the weekends or holidays. That was sort of what I was trying to explain in my extended digression to the Chief -- to the Chief Justice before. The BOP doesn't admit and discharge prisoners on the weekends. In addition, there are various other factors that -- that go into the need to have two -- two deputy marshals transporting people. So the transportation doesn't generally occur on the weekends. And it's because of the weekends and holidays that the transportation of the defendant actually took the amount of time that it -- that it did here. But I would say, as I started, in urging you not to address this issue, which is of no ongoing importance, that the question that we did ask the Court to address and that the Court granted review on is a very important question that's divided the circuits; and that allowing the rule that the court below adopted to continue to stand could frustrate the application of the Speedy Trial Act, not only with respect to the pretrial motions exclusion but potentially with respect to all the other automatic exclusions; and I think it's very important that the Court correct this error and reaffirm the established rule. If I could reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor. First I would like to stress that the government thinks that it's very important that the Court address the question that we raised in our cert petition, and that the Court granted certiorari to answer, on which there's a split in the circuits and which we believe that if it's left standing will result in serious disruption to the Speedy Trial Act. Turning to -- to that question, a few points first. Respondent's definition of delay is plainly inconsistent with Henderson which already holds that the period of delay that's excludable is the time between the filing of the motion and the disposition of the motion. That can't be squared with the notion that delay is the period during which trial is postponed. Second, Respondent's definition of delay gives delay a different meaning in the first part of the statute and in subsection D, where this Court's already held that it has the meaning that we suggest. Third, Respondent's test is totally unworkable, because you can't tell at the time a motion is filed how much time it's going to take to resolve and whether trial is going to be postponed. District Court judges have over 500 pending cases on their docket, an average District Court judge. A hundred of them are criminal. The court -- the Speedy Trial Act cannot function if the judges are going to have to make a complex judicial determination in each case to determine whether each motion is excludable. Respondent says that NACDL says defendants won't object or that they'll stipulate to the exclusion of time, but NACDL also says that defendants may change their mind if the case goes to trial, and if they change their mind and file a motion to dismiss under the Speedy Trial Act, their prior failures to object and stipulations may very well not be binding because this Court held in Zedner that defendants can prospectively waive the application of the Act. And Respondent's tests would also throw the established way that the Speedy Trial Act has been operating for over 30 years into disarray. Turning to whether this Court has to address the alternative arguments for affirmance, Nobles plainly says that the Court has discretion not to address those issues if those issues are not independently worthy of certiorari. It doesn't base that on the fact that the -- on the fact that the argument would expand the judgment below, and the rule that it's discretionary makes sense, because the contrary rule would require the court to address numerous issues that are not important and -- in every case where they're raised, and would also lead the court to either dismiss writs as improvidently granted or to address only as dicta important issues on which the Court has granted certiorari. Finally -­",
  "Yes, I think that we would like the Court to address the issue on which cert was granted. We think it's a very important issue. We think that the courts of appeals would follow it even if it might technically be viewed as dicta. We would think that it would be an alternative holding or ratio decidendi.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 3582(a) prohibits courts from imposing or lengthening a term of imprisonment to promote a defendant's rehabilitation, including by facilitating her access to a prison drug treatment program.",
  "Well, Congress was intending to reject the prevailing rehabilitation model of sentencing, and under that model, defendants were kept in prison until they were declared rehabilitated based on their participation in treatment programs. And what Congress determined was that -- that coercing participation in prison programs that way wasn't -- had failed and that rehabilitation couldn't be accomplished reliably in a prison setting. So -­",
  "Well, Congress expressly determined to retain -- there were people that said rehabilitation never works; it can't be a legitimate purpose of sentencing. And Congress decided not to go that far. It expressly retained rehabilitation as a purpose of sentencing. That's reflected in section 3553(a)(2)(D). But what Congress determined was that it -­ that because you couldn't reliably induce it in prison, it wasn't appropriate to deprive defendants of their liberty, expend the resources on keeping them in prison for that purpose, but that -- that rehabilitation remained a possibility, that other forms of sentencing were appropriate ways to attempt to achieve rehabilitation, and that's why Congress expressly provided that, in imposing a sentence of probation, the court can require a defendant to participate in particular treatment programs -­",
  "I think it would depend whether that was an aggravating or, you know, mitigating circumstance that the guidelines hadn't adequately taken into account, but I don't think that Congress was trying to prevent a court from selecting another sentencing option, such as probation, in lieu of imprisonment because the court determined that the primary purpose of the sentence should be rehabilitation, or to shorten the sentence to speed the defendant from imprisonment to supervised release, where the court could guarantee the defendant would participate in programs. On the other hand, if the -- it was very important, if there were important purposes of protecting the public, deterring the defendant from committing other crimes, deterring generally, then the court was supposed to sentence the defendant to prison in accordance with that, even if the defendant also needed rehabilitation.",
  "Well, the prisoner is receiving an imprisonment term -­",
  "I think the prisoner is receiving rehabilitative services, yes, in prison -- in prison, yes.",

  "Yes.",
  "Exactly, Your Honor. The -­ under the SRA, judges have no authority to place prisoners in -- place defendants in prison treatment programs or to require their participation in those programs. And Petitioner, in fact, did not participate in the drug treatment program on which the sentencing court relied in setting her prison term.",
  "Right.",
  "I think generally you take the district court at the court's word for what the purposes of the sentence are, and the sentence has to be justified by the reasons that the district court gives in sentencing the defendant.",
  "If the -- if the judge -­",

  "I think that -- that it's going to be hard for the defendant to obtain reversal of a conviction under those circumstances.",
  "Well, I think, as I said, that the words that you -- that the court is required to give its reasons for imposing sentence. We presume that district courts honestly give their reasons for imposing the sentence and that if the court is indeed lengthening the term of imprisonment because the court wants the defendant to be in a program, that the court will say that's what they're doing, just as Judge Moskowitz did here.
