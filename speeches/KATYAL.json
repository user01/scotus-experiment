[
  "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: We ask this Court to preserve the status quo to require that the President respect time-honored limitations on military commissions. These limits, placed in articles 21 and 36 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, require no more than that the President try offenses that are, indeed, war crimes and to conduct trials according to the minimal procedural requirements of the UCMJ and the laws of war themselves. These limits do not represent any change in the way military commissions have historically operated. Rather, they reflect Congress's authority under the Define and Punish Clause to codify limits on commissions, limits that this Court has historically enforced to avoid presidential blank checks. And because this commission transgresses those limits, it should be struck down and the district court order reinstated. If I could turn to the jurisdictional matter for a few moments first. We believe that the DTA, while certainly not a model of clarity, does not divest this Court of jurisdiction, for four essential reasons. The first is that, if I could turn to the surreply at page -- the appendix at page 14(a), that contains the initial version of the bill that passed the Senate on November 10th. And at 14(a) it says, on the effective-date provision, \"The amendment made by paragraph 1,\" which is the jurisdiction-stripping provision, \"shall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of enactment of this act.\" That language clearly attempted to strip courts of jurisdiction over Guantanamo claims. That language, however, was changed in the final version of the DTA, and the final version of the DTA is found at page 10(a) of the surreply. And that has the following as its effective date. It has two effective- date provisions. The first one I want to start with is H(2), review of combatant status tribunal, CSRT, and military commission decisions, \"Paragraphs 2 and 3 of subsection (e) shall apply with respect to any claim whose review is governed by one of such paragraphs and that is pending on or after the date of enactment of the Act.\" And then, there is a separate provision for the rest of the DTA, for --",
  "The change was made between November 10th and November 15th.",
  "It was made in the Senate.",
  "That --",
  "That's correct.",
  "That is correct.",
  "Well, because the language itself was, I think, the subject of an immense amount of debate. And, indeed, when the language was --",
  "In the Senate. And well-known. And, indeed, you don't have to attribute any knowledge to the President. We have evidence in the record that the administration tried to change the language back to the original formulation. And, indeed, in the House, the chairman of one of the -- the vice chairman of the Conference Report said that the change in the language was in -- was -- the change in the language meant that it grandfathered pending cases such as this one. So, this is not an example of which we have to resort simply to the negative inference of Lindh. However, we do think that is the second reason for you to believe that this case is grandfathered under the existing DTA.",
  "We believe that, as the cosponsor said, on November 15th when they introduce the final version of the language, that all of those cases are grandfathered with respect to the H(1) effective-date provision and the E(1) jurisdiction-stripping provision. However, that still leaves in place the Government's main argument in the D.C. Circuit below, which is that the E(2) provision governing CSRT and final decisions, and the H(2) provision governing final decisions of military-- final decisions of CSRTs, truncates all of the review that is currently in the D.C. Circuit. So, it's certainly plausible -- it's certainly possible, though it's not, of course, presented in this case, to read the DTA as truncating the vast majority of claims at Guantanamo in current pending cases. Of course, that isn't the issue before you here. The issue before you here is simply the Hamdan case, and there was -- and there was a strong -- the strong desire by the Congress not to interfere with this Court's traditionally exercised jurisdiction.",
  "Okay.",
  "That's right, cases in which there is a final CSRT decision; that is, that the Government's argument in the D.C. Circuit, Justice Scalia, is that there are two different ways in which the DTA truncated the review of Guantanamo cases. One is the claim that the jurisdiction-stripping provision applies to pending cases. That, we reject. That, we think the Senate rejected on November 15th when it passed the bill. The other is the claim that the E(2) provision governing final decisions of CSRTs, which does, of course, apply to pending cases, as the plain text says, eliminates and truncates a vast - - majority of the detainees' claims. That is the provision --",
  "Absolutely. And --",
  "-- to be clear, that's not the position we're saying that is the DTA. That's not presented here.",
  "That's the issue --",
  "-- below, in the D.C. Circuit. In addition, we believe that this statute doesn't fall within the Bruner Hallowell presumption that the Government seeks to -- seeks to use here, for a few reasons. The first is, this is not a statute that is merely divesting a lower court of jurisdiction. Rather, it's a statute that alters substantive rights of Mr. Hamdan. In particular, as the Government itself says, it eliminates question 2, upon which certiorari was granted, which is compliance with the Geneva Conventions. In addition, it alters entirely what both courts below found, which is that Mr. Hamdan has a pretrial right, a right analogous to Abney versus United States, to bring his claim now, because he's challenging the jurisdiction of the tribunal. That pretrial right is something that mirrors -- that goes all the way back to the founding, in the early cases that this Court decided, on pretrial habeas. In addition, we believe that --",
  "Well, as the Government says, it does -- certainly does not encompass question 2, because it eliminates the word \"treaties.\" It's a change from the habeas corpus statute. More generally, it doesn't do two things. First, if that's the reading that the Government wants to give, well, then it essentially means that the -- that the President has the ability to block habeas corpus or post-DTA review for all time, because, Justice Alito, it doesn't turn on -- you can't walk into court right after you're convicted, under the DTA; you can only walk into court after a final decision. And a final decision requires the sign-off of the President of the United States. And so, effectively, this reading would give a litigant the ability to block Federal Court review for all time.",
  "Justice Scalia -- Justice Alito, if this were a final -- if this were like a criminal proceeding, we wouldn't be here. The whole point of this is to say we're challenging the lawfulness of the tribunal itself. This isn't a challenge to some decision that a court makes. This is a challenge to the court itself. And that's why it's different than the ordinary criminal context that you're positing. The ordinary criminal context you're positing -- and I'm thinking of a case like Schlesinger versus Councilman, a court-martial case -- what the Court has said is that it's the -- the predicate for abstention is the idea that Congress has fairly balanced the rights of both sides, an independent branch, and has -- and has made certain determinations. Here, none of that has happened. It's all been made by the executive. And the difference is crucial in military justice, because, as Justice Kennedy said for the Court in Loving, the framers harbored a deep distrust of military tribunals. And the thing that makes it different than the ordinary criminal context, the thing that, as this Court said, stops military justice from being lawless is the Congress of the United States setting clear limits on the use of military justice. Now, if those limits had been observed, if this Court -- if the military commission complied with the rules of courts-martial, we wouldn't be here. Our whole point is that they don't, and that it falls outside of the well-recognized abstention exception for courts-martial cases. In addition, we believe that to further -- to further on -- Justice Alito, on your point -- this Court has already said in the military commission context that a different rule applies. In Quirin, this Court rushed in to hear a military-commission challenge before the commission was over, and the reason why it did so was, it said that the public interest required adjudication of these issues. And the public interest is no less severe in that case than it is here. That is, this is a military commission that is literally unbounded by the laws, Constitution, and treaties of the United States. And if you adopt the Government's position here, it effectively replicates the blank check that this Court rejected in Hamdi.",
  "I don't believe so.",
  "Justice Scalia, everything is different about this. That is, in your posited hypothetical, there is some law that you know will govern that ultimate question about disqualification or whatever the --",
  "-- the matter is --",
  "Well, I do think that there's an integral relationship to the -- between the two. That is, that the predicate for abstention has always been that Congress, or some other entity, has fairly balanced the rights of both sides. Here, you don't have that fundamental guarantee. Indeed, if you adopt the Government's reading here, the -- they have said that they want to try 75 military-commission cases or so in the first wave. You will then be left with 75 trials that take place without even the most basic question of what the parameters are that these commissions are to operate under.",
  "But --",
  "Well, that's precisely, Justice Scalia, our argument, that I don't think one can consider the abstention claim -- and this is what I believe both courts below had held -- you can't consider the abstention claim without deciding the underlying merits. And if you believe that the -- that Congress has fairly balanced the rights and are compliant with the UCMJ and the like, then I don't think -- then you're reaching the merits, and there's no abstention holding. So, if I could turn to the merits -- the merits challenges. The first thing I'd like to discuss on -- is question number 1 and whether this military commission states a charge that violates the laws of war. And we believe it doesn't, for two essential reasons. First, the only charge in this case is one of conspiracy. And conspiracy has been rejected as a violation of the laws of war for -- in every tribunal to consider the issue since World War II. It has been rejected in Nuremberg, it's been rejected in the Tokyo tribunals, it's been rejected in the international tribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia, and, most importantly, it's been rejected by the Congress of the United States, in 1997 --",
  "The charge itself, Justice Stevens, is found at 63(a) of the Petition appendix.",
  "Sure. And --",
  "Ordinarily, Justice Kennedy, the answer would be no, you wouldn't challenge the validity of the charge. And, indeed, I think Councilman itself is a -- is a case in which there was a charge at issue, and the question was subject-matter jurisdiction. The reason why this is different, however, is twofold. First, the claim that Mr. Hamdan is making is that conspiracy itself falls entirely out of any authorization of Congress. In Councilman, the question was -- there was an article, article 134 of the UCMJ, which was a criminal statute, and it had been interpreted to punish drug dealing. And in the case the court said where -- this Court said, \"We will defer as to whether the facts showed the requisite amount of drug dealing to violate the Uniform Code.\" Here, by contrast, Mr. Hamdan's claim is that the conspiracy charge falls entirely outside of the laws of war as a whole.",
  "The charge itself is one of conspiracy. Joint enterprise is, itself, not an independent charge in international tribunals; so you can charge, for example, murder. And your theory, in an international tribunal, of how you get to murder is joint criminal enterprise. But you'd have to charge the underlying violation, itself. Here --",
  "If you --",
  "Well, there's two different reasons. The tribunal is not authorized, and that the charge doesn't state a violation. Now, even if we assume that the tribunal is authorized and that all of its microprocedures are authorized under the act of Congress, this -- allowing this charge, conspiracy, is to open the floodgates to give the President the ability to charge whatever he wants --",
  "-- in a military commission.",
  "You are --",
  "-- absolutely correct, Justice --",
  "-- Souter. And, indeed, I would add to that that the conspiracy charge here, Justice Kennedy, is -- the problem with it is compounded by the fact that the tribunal itself is charging a violation of the laws of war, when the military commission has never operated to try violations of terrorism in stateless, territoryless conflicts. That is, it's not just the charge, but it's where the charge operates that we find so central, that the -- that there are two different things - -",
  "-- there's two different problems.",
  "They may be amended, yes.",
  "Be- --",
  "And the -- Justice Alito, the Government has had, essentially, now 4 years to get their charges together on Mr. Hamdan. At this point, that -- you know, what you have before you is the charge. And that -- and they've stuck with this charge, of conspiracy, which is not a violation of the laws of war. And, indeed, the -- and the -- it's not just conspiracy isn't, but that the commission is operating in totally uncharted waters, because it's charging a violation in a stateless, territoryless conflict, something as to which the full laws of war have never applied. Indeed, Justice Alito, all 10 people facing military commissions today, all 10 indictments charge conspiracy right now. Seven only charge conspiracy.",
  "Not in -- not here, because, as, I think, both courts below indicated, this case, and his challenge, falls very much like Abney versus United States. This is a challenge to the lawfulness of the underlying tribunal and the charge that's against him. Indeed, this Court, in Quirin, heard, as its first question, Does the charge state a violation of the laws of war? That was the first thing it said had to be asked. So, I think the -- what we are doing is applying nothing more than the settled practice that has always been the case with respect to military commissions. And it -- in -- the public interest here, again, just as in Quirin, I think, requires some limits placed on military commissions, Justice Alito, because, otherwise, if the Government's position is taken as the final word, it'll give the President the ability to essentially create that blank check, for years on end, render a final decision at some point, and then that final decision will then be subject to the truncated review procedures in the DTA, which I don't think is what Congress intended when they changed the language of the bill. Rather, I think what they did was intend that this Court would decide the basic -- apply the basic structural limits on military commissions that have always applied.",
  "It is clear, Justice Stevens. That is -- that is precisely what the international tribunals reject. Conspiracy is a standalone offense. One can charge, as a war crime, attacking civilians and the like, as a pure crime, but what you can't do is charge conspiracy. And, indeed, the Congress of the United States, in 1997, when they wrote the War Crimes Act, essentially made that conclusion, because they defined \"war crimes\" with incorporating a variety of treaties --",
  "If the --",
  "Justice Kennedy, on this particular point, on conspiracy, yes, if -- that you couldn't charge some other offense, like aiding and abetting, and transmute some conspiracy charge into that. Rather, the international law and the laws of the United States recognize you can prosecute him for aiding and abetting as a violation of whatever the specific underlying crime is, like murder or attacking civilians. What you can't do is use the standalone offense of conspiracy. And here's why. Because the standalone offense of conspiracy is rejected by international law, because it's too vague. And this Court has said that the test for a violation of the laws of war is when universal agreement and practice make it a violation. The world rejects conspiracy, because if it's adopted it allows so many individuals to get swept up within its net. Justice Kennedy, aiding and abetting requires a much closer relationship between the conduct and the individual offender. Conspiracy does not. And so, for example, under the Government's theory, a little old lady in Switzerland who donates money to al Qaeda, and that turns out to be a front for terrorist acts and so on, might be swept up within this broad definition of conspiracy. And that's why international law has so rejected the concept of conspiracy.",
  "Well, it is the role of this Court to confine the tribunal to its lawful jurisdiction. That's what this Court held in Quirin. And that's what we think you should do here. The tribunal itself can't be the judge of its own jurisdiction.",
  "Again, we think, at this point, that the public interest is best served by this Court saying that conspiracy doesn't violate -- to set some limits. After all, all -- everyone facing a military commission is facing this charge. Seven are only facing this charge. The Government wants to put 75 of these cases through. And it has taken 4 and a half years since the President's military order --",
  "-- for this case --",
  "If the charge is the specific offenses themselves, not aiding and abetting, Justice Stevens --",
  "Yes, with respect to this particular claim about conspiracy, that would solve that problem. If you say the charge is attacking civilians, and your theory of proving it is aiding and abetting the murder or the attacking of civilians --",
  "-- yes.",
  "That would mix apples and oranges, because \"conspiracy\" and \"aiding and abetting\" are two entirely different things. One is a standalone offense. And one is a theory of how to prove a violation --",
  "It's not, Justice Stevens, because it requires a different level of participation, and the liability is entirely different. Because if conspiracy is accepted, you're accepting Pinkerton liability. That's what the Government's own charge said -- the Government's own instruction said, which means that Mr. Hamdan is liable for all the acts of 9/11 and everything al Qaeda has done. \"Aiding and abetting,\" as you are saying, Justice Stevens, in your hypothetical, is a much more closely tethered theory of liability, requiring a higher level of individual culpability and a totally different level of punishment.",
  "That is correct. If I could turn to a second argument for why we believe this military commission is impermissible, and that is that it defies the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The Uniform Code of Military Justice, in article 36, sets minimal ground rules for military justice, writ large. And it says that the President can't act in ways that are contrary to, or inconsistent with, this chapter. As Judge Robertson found, already we know that has happened here. Mr. Hamdan has been kicked out of his criminal trial right at the get-go. And the Government's position is that they don't have to abide by the UCMJ, which is a further reason, of course, why we believe that abstention isn't appropriate, because it defies the rules set out by Congress. We're asking this Court to apply the minimal rules of the UCMJ to the military commissions that operate at Guantanamo Bay, because article 2 of the UCMJ has been extended, and its protections now extend to Guantanamo Bay and protect those who are detained there. And one of its protections is the right to be present, and that has been fundamentally violated by -- already. If I could --",
  "We do.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Justice Scalia, that's what the Government would like you to believe. I don't think that's true. The historical relationship has been that military commissions in courts-martial follow the same procedures. That's what General Crowder said when he testified in 1916, and what this Court has quoted from his testimony. It's what every military treatise says. Now, to be clear, our position is not that military commissions must follow all the rules for courts- martial. Not at all. They must require -- must follow the minimal baseline rules set in the Uniform Code of Military Justice by Congress. They can depart from the panoply of rules, the 867 pages of rules in the Manual for Courts-Martial, so long as they don't depart from the UCMJ itself. Congress has answered this question, Justice Scalia, in article 36, by saying the President does have a wide ability to depart from the rules, but he can't depart from the fundamentals of the UCMJ. And, indeed, that's what --",
  "Well --",
  "Well, we do believe that the -- that the entire panoply of UCMJ protection --",
  "-- is involved.",
  "Well --",
  "Absolutely. There's an article 10 right for speedy charges. There is also an article 67 right for independent Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces review, which is something that is not guaranteed by this commission. And so -- and, indeed, was a predicate for this Court's abstention holding in Councilman. So, we do believe that there are -- that these fundamental rights apply. And, of course, this is just all, Justice Kennedy, default rules. If the -- if the Congress wants to pass a law to exempt military commissions from article 36, that -- they are free to do so, and that will then be -- that'll then be --",
  "-- a separate case --",
  "Well, we had them before, because -- we had them before, because we couldn't find military court-martial jurisdiction. They were situations of absolute necessity. The reason was that the Articles of War, for one reason or another, didn't cover particular individuals. And, therefore, we needed to craft a separate procedure. But, whenever we did so, Justice Breyer, we always said that court-martial rules apply. In 1847, which is really the first instance of a military commission, because General Washington operated under statutory charges to try spying -- but in 1847, we applied court-martial rules by General Order Number 1. In the Civil War, we applied General Order Number 1 again, and it said that it would -- that we needed to apply to court-martial -- court-martial rules, because, otherwise, abuses would arise. And, essentially, the worry is one of forum shopping, that you give the President the ability to pick a forum and define the rules. And that -- and that fundamentally open-ended authority is what I believe this Court rejected in Hamdi, and it's -- and when it rejected the blank check.",
  "Certainly, there's nothing in the text of the act itself -- and even -- I know this isn't relevant for you, but for other individuals on the Court -- there's nothing in the legislative history, or even the post -- even the brief filed by Senators Graham and Kyl, which suggest, in any way, that this was ratification. But suppose it were, Justice Scalia. Suppose it did ratify some sort of military commission. I don't believe that it authorized this military commission with this charge, conspiracy, in this conflict, a stateless, territoryless conflict, with these procedures, procedures that violate the UCMJ. So, it may be that they authorized something. But even that, I think, may be a bit hard, because, after all, what they did was authorize, as Justice Alito said, certain challenges to military commissions.",
  "They -- I think it's perfectly -- well, it's a -- it's a -- it is a possible reading to say the DTA authorized some sort of military commission. The text doesn't say so. It is, of course, addressed to the jurisdiction of this Court, and not in any way to the -- to the -- to the -- to the underlying merits. I do think that the -- that there is a -- you know, a conceivable argument. However, the reason why I think this Court, if it did decide to reach that ultimate question, should reach it against the Government, is that that kind of back-door kind of -- you know, approval by inference has never been sufficient when it comes to authorizing military jurisdiction, in the most awesome powers of the Government, to dispense life imprisonment and death. That is, I think, a clearer statement would be required in this unique setting, because we aren't talking about, after all, minor things. We're talking about the most grave powers of our Government, the power to dispense life imprisonment and death. And I certainly don't think Congress, on the basis of a few hours of debate, intended to ratify this entire apparatus. If I could turn to question 2 and the Geneva Conventions, I'd like to start with Common Article 3 and its minimal baseline requirements that a regularly constituted court be set up, and one that dispense -- that affords the rights indispensable to civilized peoples. As Judge Williams found, below, that article does apply to Mr. Hamdan, and protects him. It's the most minimal rudimentary requirements that the United States Senate adhered to when it ratified the convention in 1955. And those requirements --",
  "Well, I think the way that it has been interpreted, \"regularly constituted court,\" is not an ad hoc court with ad hoc rules. So, that is to say, Justice Scalia, if they resuscitated --",
  "So long as it is, (a) independent of the executive, which is what it's been interpreted to be, and, (b) affords the rights known to civilized peoples. And here, we think this military commission strays from both of those -- both of those. It's not independent of the executive --",
  "So far, Justice Ginsburg, all that we have before -- you know, I think all that's happened is the right to be present. To look to what other rights are guaranteed by Common Article 3, you can look to Additional Protocol 1 of the Geneva Conventions, which specifies rights like appeal rights and the like. But they're the most minimal baseline rights. We're not talking about, you know, Miranda rights or something like that. We're talking about just a set of core ideas that every country on the world -- every country in the world is supposed to dispense when they create war-crimes trials. And, even that minimal standard, the Government says they don't want to apply here. And why we think this is enforceable is that Mr. Hamdan is being prosecuted in the name of the laws of war. And he has the right to invoke the Geneva Conventions defensively as a -- as a way to constrain the tribunal, to say that they can't --",
  "No, Justice Kennedy, for two reasons.",
  "The CSRT, to my knowledge, never asked any of those --",
  "-- questions about --",
  "-- uniforms or --",
  "We would love a beginning point. And the beginning point is an article 5 hearing, which is required by Army Regulation 190-8, in article 5 of the Geneva Conventions. The CSRT in no way suffices to do that. It didn't ask those questions about, Are -- you know, uniforms, and the like, to my knowledge. Of course, the CSRT isn't in the record, so we don't really know. The Government said, below, that it had, quote, \"zero effect on this case,\" and didn't introduce it. But, be that as it may, suppose that the CSRT did decide that Mr. Hamdan is an enemy combatant. Justice Kennedy, most enemy combatants are prisoners of war. So, if anything, all the CSRT did was affirm Mr. Hamdan's separate claim, apart from Common Article 3, to the full protection of the Geneva Conventions. If I --",
  "Yes, Justice --",
  "-- Souter. If I could reserve the balance of my time.",
  "It is a foundational role of this Court, as Justice Kennedy says, to test the lawfulness of tribunals, particularly executive detention. And in the pretrial area, that's the historic role of this Court from Bereford to Quirin. This claim is -- Mr. Hamdan's claim is primarily a jurisdictional one, as both courts below found when they recognized his ability to bring this pretrial challenge, because he is not an offender under the laws of war until he obtains his article 5 hearing, because the charge doesn't state a violation of the laws of war, which is, itself, jurisdictional, and because it doesn't follow the procedures of the laws of war, which this Court, in Yamashita, in pages 5, and, in the dissent, at page 72, recognized as jurisdictional.",
  "Now, that was --",
  "With respect to conspiracy? Yes, I have. And I do believe the text says that they're referring to domestic offenses. It's certainly the case that conspiracy has been tried as a violation of the laws of war at some point in the Civil War. But that has been entirely eclipsed by the modern laws of war, which have rejected it everywhere. And if you adopt the Government's reading, Justice Stevens, that the laws of war are frozen into time in 1916, then I believe there goes the Government's case entirely, because the thrust of the Government's case is the laws of war have to adapt to this stateless, territoryless organization known as al Qaeda. If we're playing by 1916 rules, there is no way that this commission would have been accepted in 1916. Now, all of those jurisdictional pretrial challenges were accepted by the courts below when the full panoply of DTA rights -- when the full panoply of rights existed. Now the DTA certainly circumscribes the scope. We don't know whether question one very clearly is able to be raised after the DTA's enactment. We certainly -- question two, as the Solicitor General has said, is not raisable. We don't know when it can be raised, because the President can block final review for all time under the DTA. He has the keys to the Federal courthouse. And if you defer to this system and give the President the ability to launch all of these tribunals for 75 individuals with these charges, with these procedures, you will be countenancing a huge expansion of military jurisdiction. Conspiracy is one of the few offenses, Justices, that has now been rejected by the laws of war internationally in tribunal after tribunal. It's certainly never been approved by a Federal Court. And, indeed, it has been rejected. In Colepaugh, for example, no challenge to conspiracy was raised. The Government's argument, in the end, it seems to me, is one that this Court rejected in Loving, because it depends, as its predicate, on the idea that the President has ultimate flexibility with respect to these military commissions, except for the nine provisions in the UCMJ which govern translators and deposition testimony. It is inconceivable that the UCMJ, when enacted, intended to regulate military commissions with only that bare bones to it. Indeed, General Crowder said, \"Military commissions and courts-martial follow the same procedures.\" Finally, Justices, we'd just point out that the predicate of abstention is not met here. This is not a ordinary criminal trial applying lawful ordinary procedures. This is an ad hoc trial in which the procedures are all defined with the President. He says the laws of war do not apply when we're talking about protecting this vulnerable individual at Guantanamo. But then he says they do apply and permit him to charge Mr. Hamdan with the one offense which is rejected entirely at international law. It was a great American patriot, Thomas Paine, who warned, \"He who -- that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression, for if he violates that duty, he establishes a precedent that will reach unto himself.\" That's what we're asking you to do here, just enforce the lawful uses of military commissions and the historic role of this Court. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit held that no discrimination against a public employee is prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause unless the targeted person is a member of the suspect class or exercises a fundamental right. No matter how outrageous or evil and no matter how unrelated to any legitimate government interest, the clause provides zero protection. This theory is contrary to the Constitution's text. It is inconsistent with this Court's precedents. It is unworkable and is unnecessary. The Ninth Circuit ignored the Equal Protection Clause's guarantee to any person that the State will not use its vast powers to discriminate without a legitimate government purpose and particularly not in ways that lead to inefficient government. This Court has articulated three principles that control this case. First, the Constitution protects the individual from irrational discrimination. Second, the Fourteenth Amendment applies to public employers and rational-basis review applies to public employment. And third, the clause applies to the administrative actions of State officials, not just legislatures.",
  "We are, Your Honor. The Ninth Circuit below said no rational-basis test ever; and, indeed, the trial in this case allowed the government to articulate any rationale, conceivable or not. We do think, even though it doesn't make --",
  "Well, we do think that that can be enough; and, indeed, that's what the government had their opportunity to argue in this case. The Ninth Circuit, of course, cuts off even that very deferential inquiry altogether. Now --",
  "Well, if it is a counter- factual -- I mean, the plaintiff would have the opportunity to negate the facts on whatever that rationale.",
  "And if it has anything to do with government efficiency, the rational-basis test is that deferential to permit that to go forward.",
  "Even that, Justice Breyer, is enough so long as it's related to government efficiency. That is --",
  "That, by itself, is not because the government has --",
  "Okay. Let me say two things because there are two different questions there. One has to do with the State laws, and so on. And this Court has never said that the existence of other State remedies somehow displaces the Equal Protection Clause or other constitutional guarantees.",
  "The answer is no, Justice Ginsburg, and the reason is at footnote 18 of our brief, and I believe the Solicitor General doesn't disagree in large amount. That is that for Bivens the question is, will the court imply a right of action, as opposed to the issue in this case, which is Section 1983. There is a statutory right of action already in existence.",
  "Not --",
  "That is correct. It doesn't -- the existence of those State remedies does not displace by itself without a statutory -- without Congress coming in and mandating exhaustion or something like that. But in the absence of that, this Court has not said, outside of the limited area of procedural due process, that the existence of either collective-bargaining agreements or State laws somehow displaces a Federal constitutional guarantee. Now, if I could return to the first part of Justice Breyer's question, which was the dividing line in whether there is a clear standard, let me articulate this as one. We believe that when a government employer comes in and asserts some sort of objective reality, you know, so for here they said the wheat prices are declining, the plaintiff should have a chance to negate that and say, well, it turned out that actually the wheat prices weren't declining, and so on. If, however, the plaintiff -- the government articulates the rationale that you had put forth before, I don't like you, and somehow the supervisor says it's interfering with my government efficiency and I can't do the job, well, that's something that the employer will never really be able to -- the employee will never be able to negate. And that is set forth in our reply brief at page 16.",
  "The government must always have a reason when it discriminates against individuals.",
  "That is -- that is correct as long as -- as long as, Justice Souter, it is not related to government efficiency; that is, if it's like this case, in which --",
  "Exactly.",
  "To the contrary, Justice Souter. I don't think that will happen and indeed has not happened and there is not a disagreement --",
  "Justice Souter, as a practical matter it won't matter -- as a practical matter it won't make a difference. And the reason is because an employee can articulate, I don't like you, and it's undermining government efficiency, in most cases -- and particularly in at-will cases, where there isn't a collective bargaining agreement or a State law that will constrain the ability of the employer to even articulate some sort of efficiency --",
  "And if there isn't an efficiency --",
  "-- and the State can't articulate an efficiency-based rationale --",
  "-- there will be some effect on at-will employment in those rare cases.",
  "Well, except that the cause that the equal protection mandates, the Equal Protection clauses guarantee, is to deferential that as Justice Breyer said, virtually any rationale will suffice if it is --",
  "That the government must always have a reason?",
  "Well, I read this Court's decision in Olech as basically mandating that as well as -- you know, as well as its long history on a class-of-one starting with Sioux City and Sunday Lake and Snowden versus --",
  "And here, of course, the jury found that invidious motive. So even if we were to --",
  "If the Court were worried about at-will employment, it has available to it the possibility of requiring animus just as Justice Kennedy -- or possibly in some --",
  "If -- if the government articulates a rationale that is objectively based, budget or something like that, yes; the plaintiff can come back and try and rebut. It now it does so under the extremely deferential rational basis test, which is why so few causes get through. And indeed --",
  "Because if the government can put forth --",
  "Yeah, I don't believe it goes to the jury, Justice Alito, because under this Court's decision in Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, summary judgment stage will incorporate whatever the rationale basis test or review is.",
  "Again as long as the employer can articulate a reason based on government efficiency, there is no way for that employee to rebut that.",
  "Well, there are two problems with that. The first is those are already Federal cases under existing laws, Title VII, the panoply of other laws.",
  "But if we're positing a frequent filer plaintiff who's bent on trying to file a lawsuit, they can always make a Title VII. They can say you're firing me because of --",
  "And -- and the empirical evidence, Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, is that that doesn't happen. You know, we've had this cause of action now for 26 and 27 years in two circuits. It's now the law of the land in nine circuits; we haven't had that entire flood, nor have we had the harm to at-will employment. And the reason is that plaintiffs aren't going to bring these causes of action when they know they are so hard to win.",
  "The existing --",
  "Well, I don't think there is anything quite wrong with that. I would say two things: One, the existence of all of those State remedies and so on are far more attractive for the employment plaintiff than this cause of action. And so, that's one reason why you see these low numbers. Second is I don't quite agree with you that the lower courts are, you know, maybe not taking it seriously or however. They have a long-established body of law now on how to dismiss these cases on 12(b)(6) motions, and the majority of the circuits have already upheld that because of the similarly situated requirements and intentionality requirements, as well as on summary judgment; that is, because the test is so deferential.",
  "Well, normally it depends on the rationale that's being offered. Here the government's rationale was declining wheat revenues, and so each of the employees who was paid out of those wheat revenues is similarly situated. The government in this case disclaimed the other rationales, performance and so on. In the ordinary case --",
  "Well, there were two different budgetary issues. One was the budget having to do with the Oregon State budget, and that was ultimately withdrawn by the State. The other was that Ms. Engquist and 10 other or so employees were being paid out of wheat revenues, and the State's rationale at trial was that the wheat market was collapsing, and so they couldn't pay for Ms. Engquist anymore. And she was --",
  "The government can offer those.",
  "Absolutely not. It can pick many reasons.",
  "We think that's right. Now, there are --",
  "I might have misunderstood Justice Scalia's question. I thought he was saying does the government -- can the government put forth a conceivable rationale grounded in some fact, and the answer to that is yes. It's got to be grounded in fact. That is the test.",
  "The plaintiffs --",
  "The government has the ability to put that forth and the plaintiff has the ability to negate that. That is the rational-basis test under this.",
  "As -- to negate the facts.",
  "Justice --",
  "So long as, Justice Scalia, that rationale is itself grounded in the facts. That is, you can't come in and say she wasn't -- she was coming to work late when she wasn't. But if she were, then --",
  "The test here is -- the test I'm trying to offer is one of objective -- objective -- whether the rationale is objectively falsifiable.",
  "That is a problem, I think, under this Court's decision in Olech generally. It affects class-of-one --",
  "I do not. I think this Court has had a long history on --",
  "Let me go back, Justice Kennedy, to answer your question more directly. This Court has held in the employment case -- in the employment context, that the government must have a rational basis. It said so in Harrah v. Martin, Beazer and Murgia, all of which say that when an employer is dismissing employees, it must act with a rational basis. So this Court has already crossed that --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I don't quite think that describes the fact of Harrah v. Martin in which it was a challenge to an individual termination decision by the school board. But I do agree the other cases are group-based characteristics. We don't think that makes a difference, and indeed we think that the Solicitor General's test on this would be unworkable in practice, because everyone can assert their membership in some objective --",
  "Well, I will try. So the first thing is that -- I don't quite think that describes the facts of Harrah versus Martin, which is an individual decision. And, secondly, once you start going down the line of objective, group-based characteristics and the like, it is infinitely manipulable, and that's why the Ninth Circuit decisions after, in the wake of this decision below, are dismissing group-based claims on -- on disability and age and the like. Everyone can replead their claim as part of a group, that is, Ms. -- you know, Ms. Engquist can say she's part of a group of two, those who complained about their supervisors and up the chain of command. And so the problem is it becomes unworkable in practice. And, of course, the Constitution, Justice Ginsburg, doesn't say, the way the Solicitor General would like it be, doesn't say no State shall deny equal protection of the law to anyone who is a member of an objective group-based, you know, group and class.",
  "I don't quite think that -- I think the Court has already dealt with that in Olech by affirming, essentially, a 1983 cause of action based on an individual person's claim. And so -- and so that is the relevant precedent here, not the section 1985 precedents. Now, if we --",
  "But the statutory test -- text, Justice Ginsburg, is the same. There's one section 19 --",
  "I would agree with that. I think it might open a whole can of worms were the Court to say that 1983 requires some group-based discrimination outside of this particular context that we are talking about. And so I think --",
  "Except, Justice Ginsburg, we've had this cause of action now for 26 and 27 years in two circuits; we have it in nine. We haven't seen the effect on at-will employment nor, more generally, on the Equal Protection Clause opening up that can of worms that you're hypothesizing. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time. Thank you.",
  "The Ninth Circuit in this case, Your Honor, has cut out all claims conceivable or otherwise, and that is contrary to the text of the Equal Protection Clause in this Court's precedent.",
  "It would, Justice Souter, under the formal rule; that is, no reason alone is sufficient. That of course as a practical matter is not the way at-will works anymore, because of the panoply of rules, Title 7 and otherwise that force employers to articulate rationales when they terminate at-will employees. So as a practical matter the no-reason firing doesn't exist anymore because those employees, those at-will employees who are going to sue are going to sue anyway.",
  "No. This Court has consistently held that the text of the Equal Protection Clause encompasses personal claims.",
  "That's quite right, Justice Alito. And in fact since 1879 this Court has said --",
  "I'm not sure I got that down, sir.",
  "I'm not sure if in all other respects it is, but with respect to the relevant questions here -- that is, does this clause apply to individual agency actions, this Court has held so in 1879 in Missouri versus Lewis, and has held so consistently ever since. So in this case the government put forth one rationale which was an objective one, we -- and disclaimed all the others, the subjective ones; and we do think that that subjective rationales in employment is different, and would almost always be a rational basis. In this case they disclaimed all those other ones. So here the government is using its power, its raw power, surely for its own personal ends and that is contrary to the whole notion of why employment should be different within government efficiency.",
  "Batson I think supports exactly what we are saying, which is this Court has said we don't review on rational basis, actions by a prosecutor that are motivated, strikes that are motivated by the trial, that are -- that are for a good trial; but if the rationale of the prosecutor is I don't like the disabled person, or I don't like --",
  "I don't quite think that this Court has confronted that specific issue about whether it's an individual class-of one juror case. But the language of Batson says that we don't -- that this Court won't review on rational basis a claim when it's related to the government's motivation. They are to have a fair trial, a good trial.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, the language in Batson and J.E.B. was qualified by as saying so long as it related to the task at hand; and the Seventh Circuit and indeed, the D.C. Circuit last year referred to that language and talked about an exemption if the prosecute's motive was personal, as it is in this case.",
  "In the Seventh Circuit decision the court said this would stay the cause of action. This was after this Court's decision in J.E.B., yes.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit created a novel constitutional right by extending Brady to the postconviction setting. Mr. Osborne doesn't attempt to defend that rationale. Instead, he attempts to mint a previously unrecognized liberty interest in access to clemency or State postconviction procedures. Assuming the Court reaches the second question presented, it should not constitutionalize rules for postconviction access to DNA, an area of great legislative ferment in the last few years. And even were it inclined to do so, the unusual facts of this case, which include failure to attest to actual innocence under threat of perjury, two recent confessions to the crime, and a tactical decision at trial to forego a highly discriminating RFLP DNA test, all together make this a particularly poor candidate for recognizing a new constitutional entitlement.",
  "There are two confessions to the parole authorities. One is found at page - - petition appendix 71a. There's a small reprint which is the written portion of the -- of the confession. There's also separately in the record -- this is at supplemental excerpts of the record, pages 248 to 261, in the Ninth Circuit, which - -",
  "That is -- that is correct.",
  "Well, I am not quite sure that we have had any situation like this, in which you have had so many different facts altogether that -- that suggested both that he -- that he's guilty and that - - and you are talking about a confession that's taken place years after. I think the cases that are referred to by the amici are situations in which someone has confessed generally at trial or something like that. Here you have two confessions years later. They are very detailed. The one in the -- in the supplemental excerpts to the record is a very long story. And he says that he told his attorney about it and talks all about how he had confessed to his mother, how it was very difficult to exorcise. It is a very in-depth confession, and it is a confession that the - - that the Alaska courts have credited. It is not just our word. At joint appendix page 221, the Alaska court found -- listened to that 2004 confession in light of the 2006 affidavit that Mr. Osborne makes much of claiming that he is innocent and put those two documents side by side and said, taken together, they don't -- the 2006 affidavit does not really take - -",
  "The -- the State has so agreed.",
  "Well, it is -- it is not clear to me under State law. I think as I understood my friend -- but that's what I understood him to say. I can tell you, Justice Breyer, for purposes of the Federal law, 18 USC 3600 has a requirement in it which says that in order to get DNA testing you must attest under threat of perjury that you are actually innocent. That is a very serious requirement, done after years of congressional debate. That is something that the Ninth Circuit rule would disregard, and it would permit someone to come in without that.",
  "Our position, Justice Scalia, is that there is no constitutional right to DNA, but if -- were the Court inclined to find one and locate it somewhere in Brady or the procedural due process clause, something we think which would be very difficult to do, but were it -- if that were the Court's inclination, absolutely, it should at least mirror the Federal statute and the -- and the rock solid requirements of 3600, which do require that perjury -- that perjury statement to be made in order to - -",
  "Well, this Court has struggled with that and so far has said no. And the latest position is Herrera v. Collins.",
  "Our position is that the logic of this Court's precedents is that there is no right at present to actual innocence.",
  "The United States wouldn't - - wouldn't have an interest as a -- would generally permit as a matter of prosecutorial ethics access to -- if the United States knew that there was some exculpatory material that it had within its purview, it would turn that over. It just wouldn't be a constitutional - -",
  "Well, I think that it would - - it would have to -- if it adopted such a rule and allowed the talking in any situation - -",
  "Let me talk about DNA, for example.",
  "Let me talk about DNA. The reason why with respect to DNA is it's a no-cost proposition for a defendant to say: Hey, I'm innocent, I want to get tested - -",
  "-- So that's why - -",
  "Well, it depends on the circumstances of the hypothetical and whether or not there's some -- whether or not it would open up the floodgates, I guess, to other requests and so on. With respect to DNA, there is - -",
  "It's possible, because there - - it may be that as a policy matter they will allow it. But as a matter of constitutional law, Justice Souter, this Court has repeatedly said - -",
  "Again, there may be because of floodgates or other reasons. But for the - -",
  "Seven thus far, Justice Stevens. If this Court were to recognize a constitutional right to DNA for all 50 States, there would really be, I think, quite a dramatically different result.",
  "Precisely. So we're talking about seven in one State right now, but I think the numbers could be great. That was what Congress said when they passed 3600, which said there has to be something to lose on the stake of defendants, so that they can't come in, like Mr. Osborne, and have questionable statements as to whether they're actually innocent or not.",
  "Because, Justice Breyer, that's not the way this Court approaches due process questions. Were it, for example, non-unanimous jury verdicts, which two States have, would be impermissible.",
  "But you enter the thicket of practical problems, it seems to me, Justice Breyer, when you do that, because the 44 States that have these statutes do it in a variety of different ways with respect to perjury requirements, felonies versus misdemeanors, who gets access, who pays for it, do they get lawyers. There's a host of policy questions that arise - -",
  "Were that the case, then Alaska itself would be within that framework, because it already has a process in place. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: And let me begin where Mr. Coleman left off, because I don't think that his argument adequately grapples either with this Court's consistent upholding of the provision at issue 4 times over 4 decades or with Congress's action in 2006. Congress's reauthorization in 2006 was the paradigmatic attempt of what to do in Congress. It didn't redefine a rate, nor did it cast aspersions at Supreme Court doctrine. Rather, it took that doctrine seriously, both this Court's teachings with respect to the Voting Rights Act specifically, as well as the -- as the scope of the Congress's Reconstruction enforcement powers, and arrived at a considered judgment. After 16,000 pages of testimony, 21 different hearings over 10 months, Congress looked at the evidence and determined that their work was not done.",
  "I -- I disagree with that, Mr. Chief Justice. I think what that represents is that section 5 is actually working very well; that it provides a deterrent. This was a debate in Congress. Indeed, Mr. Coleman himself testified before Congress and said the low objection rate is evidence that it isn't congruent to proportional. The Congress disagreed with that. What it found instead was that section 5 was deterring the problem.",
  "Well, let me suggest another example. Yesterday the Administrative Office for the United States Courts said there were approximately 17,500 requests for Title 3 wiretaps in the past 10 years. Four of them had been rejected. That's a .023 percent rejection rate. But I don't think one could use those numbers and say, oh, that means that Title 3 doesn't deter or prevent abusive wiretaps. What it suggests instead, if Congress would have found -- I agree that if we were just standing up with no record whatsoever, that's one thing, but if Congress heard testimony, they found example after example of - -",
  "Absolutely. And Congress found with respect to those intentional -- laws that prevent intentional vote discrimination, which is section 2, which you hear Mr. Coleman relying on today, that that is ineffective for the same reasons that this Court has found them repeatedly in South Carolina v. Katzenbach, in City of Rome.",
  "Quite a bit of evidence about the ineffectiveness of section 2 as a remedy. So -- and the statement for the intervenors -- there's a 500-page statement filed before the district court which excerpts the congressional record. In the pages 270 to 279 you see a long series of -- a long analysis by Congress about how section 2 is ineffective, that it costs too much to bring the litigation, that there are few attorneys that will handle it, that -- that there isn't enough money and that - -",
  "I don't believe so. I think Congress had to make some showing. And here there are explicit legislative findings that say that section 5 is needed in these areas - -",
  "Well, I disagree with that for several reasons. First of all, and most I think what this utility district can argue about is Texas, and Congress found very specific evidence about discrimination in the State of Texas. They found that they led the country in the number of objections. They found that the -- that the registration rates, as Justice Souter said, between Hispanics and whites was great.",
  "Well, again, I think that what Congress found is that the rate in Texas coupled with its historical amount of discrimination together justified -- justified the reauthorization of section 5.",
  "Again, I think what this Court has -- has answered that question in Katzenbach by saying it may be the case that there are other jurisdictions discriminate more, Congress can deal with the problem one step at a time. And the -- and Congress has said that the Court should be particularly worried about trying to predict the future and say that discrimination is now over. We have fairly good - -",
  "Absolutely not.",
  "Well, Congress here said 25 years was -- 25 years was the appropriate reauthorization period.",
  "Well, again, if Congress can't make the findings, then I think this Court would be well within its powers to -- to strike it down. But here the Court is being asked to do something that has never been done before, which is to use its Fifteenth -- to say that Congress exceeded the balance of its Fifteenth Amendment powers and its Fourteenth Amendment powers in an area involving race and voting. That has never happened before.",
  "It certainly is. We don't - -",
  "I don't know what the budget is. I can tell you there are -- there are approximately 30 attorneys who work in the voting - -",
  "Again, I don't quarrel with that, but Congress certainly - -",
  "I -- I certainly think the burden on the States is relevant. Also relevant is the fact that the States are now not coming before the Court and objecting the way they were in South Carolina v. Katzenbach.",
  "I wouldn't put it at all in those terms. I would say what Congress found is that there is a historical amount of discrimination coupled with recent evidence and comparative data between covered and noncovered jurisdictions that justifies continuation of a remedy that States now overwhelmingly appreciate.",
  "But -- but - -",
  "Justice Kennedy, their burden is the same as it has always been in South Carolina versus Katzenbach and City of Rome. The burden is on Congress to say is continuation of this landmark achievement, one of the most transformative acts in American history, still justified, because with this act what Congress -- what Congress did was essentially redeem itself in the eyes of the world.",
  "And Congress did show precisely that. They showed, for example, Justice Kennedy, that -- that the differential between covered and noncovered States with respect to section 2 lawsuits was 57 percent of successful section 2 lawsuits were filed in covered jurisdictions, even though they are 25 percent of the population - -",
  "Because that -- because, again, that is only one aspect of the overall problem, the amount of registration rates or something like that. What Congress has historically done ever since the inception of the Voting Rights Act is target those States where discrimination is so rooted that it is hard to get rid of without preclearance. Preclearance will transform the landscape and enfranchise millions of Americans. And Congress heard evidence and said, after 16,000 pages of testimony, that the extension in these specific areas was necessary in order to root out and prevent discriminatory changes.",
  "There -- there -- there are certainly some oddities, as there always have been, from Katzenbach and from City of Rome. And what this Court has said is that Congress can act on the state-by-state level and -- and that there is a remedy for the problem, which is the bailout provision - -",
  "That's correct.",
  "There -- there have been 18 under the new provision, which is - -",
  "I am saying - -",
  "Again - -",
  "Justice Scalia, that precise argument was made to Congress in 2006 and it was rejected. And it - -",
  "And I think it's not right because what the testimony found was that States are able to bail out, but they don't, and this goes back to my point to Justice Kennedy, because today States are finding that preclearance actually serves their interests; it increases - -",
  "Well, I don't think that's a quite fair characterization. After all, here, Congress in 2006 -- all Senators voted for this bill, and indeed 90 of the 110 Representatives from covered jurisdictions voted for it, so if the Court is concerned about - -",
  "Excuse me?",
  "Well, I think that we shouldn't -- this Court should be loathe to second-guess the motivations of Congress under - -",
  "That's precisely right, Justice Ginsburg, and what the covered jurisdictions also say is something about how this -- the test before this Court shouldn't be the narrowest time slice of today, but rather the test should be to think about historically what has happened.",
  "And this Court has recognized and the brief of the covered jurisdictions recognizes the fact that it's a separate sovereign requiring in this provides an additional deterrent element and increases the integrity of the elections. If I could return to the point I was saying a moment ago, what these covered jurisdictions are saying is that this moment in time isn't the right test. Rather you should look at the overall historical record - -",
  "That is correct. And here this Court has repeatedly said this isn't any sort of surrendering of power. It was justified because of the record of discrimination. South Carolina v Katzenbach, Justice Kennedy, I don't quite think said that defiance was the precondition; rather it found that the onerous amount of case-by-case litigation itself wasn't enough. And I would caution this Court because this Court has had examples before in which the historical record looked good at a narrow moment in time. If we think back 100 years to Reconstruction, 95 percent of African-Americans in franchise, 600 black members in the State legislatures, 8 black members of Congress, 8 black justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Things looked good, and that led this Court in the civil rights cases over Justice Harlan's lone dissent to say the era of special protection was over.",
  "Yes, absolutely, because that's what City of Rome argued in 1980, and what this Court said in rejecting precisely that argument over Justice Powell's dissent, was that it's not that discrimination can't be to be at the individual unit-by-unit level. It rather, if Congress so chooses, can do it on a more broad level.",
  "That's correct.",
  "First of all there was a bailout provision at issue in 1980. It was amended in 1982. And yes, I think Congress contemplated a process -- the legislative record on this is very clear.",
  "I do. I think that Congress, Congress' reports, it's 16,000-page track record - -",
  "I do agree that they went State by State and showed -- showed tremendous amounts of discrimination in those places. Of course I disagree with the notion that this utility district can point to any one place in the country, be it Massachusetts or some corner in Georgia, and say well, the evidence wasn't there. I think Congress has far more latitude under its Fifteenth and Fourteenth Amendment powers.",
  "Justice Kennedy, the only evidence in the record is that the bailout provision works nothing like the way that it might be hypothesized. That is, every single county, every single political subdivision that has asked for a bailout has received one, and in 2006 there was an even amendment offered to minimize the bailout provision. That amendment was rejected overwhelmingly, and the reason it was rejected was that jurisdictions that are covered have now come to appreciate the power of Section 5 to deter voting discrimination, and that's why Congress made a judgment - -",
  "For the way the statute works, they have to go to the 107 subunits, which is absolutely feasible because they are under contract with all 107 subunits to administer their elections. They have all of the voting data to put together that bailout, and in previous - -",
  "Again, I think that's a distinction without a difference. They have all of the registration data and everything else necessary to make the bailout provision. And the only record Congress and the only record before this Court is that every single entity that has sought a bailout has received one.",
  "The number is 18.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Ten years ago, in Section 48 of Title 18, Congress crafted a narrowly targeted restriction against certain depictions of actual animal cruelty. Yet the Third Circuit struck the statute down on its face without even attempting to apply substantial overbreadth analysis. The statute has four critical features and, just as the Court last year in United States v. Williams began with statutory construction, analysis should begin there. First, like the statute at issue in the United States v. Ferber, this statute only reaches depictions of cruelty to actual living beings - - animals, not simulated ones or the written word. Second, the statute only applies to commercial messages, ones that Congress found drove the market for animal cruelty. Third, the statute examines the work as a whole - -",
  "Before Congress?",
  "Before Congress -- Congress had a bunch of testimony that showed that there were extensive -- there was a robust market in animal cruelty videos, largely focusing on crush videos -- 2 to 3,000 crush videos that were in -- that were -- that were being sold at the time.",
  "Well, hunting we think is excluded, and I could talk about that in a moment, from the reach of the act. Congress spoke in general terms, and I don't think that Mr. Stevens's statement at page 13 of his merits brief, which is to the effect that Congress repeatedly disavowed any attempt to regulate animal fighting -- dog fighting -- I don't think that is correct and the record does not support that. Congress spoke in general terms. They had a for-profit commercial market about animal cruelty, and the statute dealt with it in general terms. And they reasoned that by -- by punishing the sale of these videotapes, they would get at the underlying clandestine market - -",
  "That is -- that is correct.",
  "Yes. And the Third Circuit's decision in this case struck down the statute with respect to crush videos, with respect to the sale of video -- the creation of dog fighting videotapes, because, remember, the statute, Section 48, doesn't just encompass the - - the sale of videotapes. It also encompasses the creation of dog fighting videotapes. And, yet, the - - the Third Circuit struck that down as well. That, I think, was a fundamental error under this Court's principles, most particularly, United States v. Williams, which says that the statute should only be struck down if there is a substantial -- if there is substantial overbreadth and only if it is a last resort of the Court, not the first.",
  "In one sentence, if -- if -- if Congress sees a compelling interest in regulating the means of production and does not target the underlying content, they can -- they can regulate a depiction, so long as it leaves alternative mechanisms for that expression in -- in place, and that is I think what Ferber - -",
  "United States v. Ferber -- New York v. Ferber. In Ferber, the Court -- the Court dealt, as modified or as glossed by your decision in Free Speech Coalition, because what Ferber and Free Speech Coalition together say is that Congress was not -- or the legislature, was not targeting the contents of a depiction; rather, it was trying to get at and dry up the underlying market, child exploitation in that case.",
  "And this case is fundamentally different from all of those because here Congress is not aiming at the underlying communicative impact. It's not saying, as it was in the - -",
  "Quite to the contrary, Justice Scalia. The bona fides of this statute are evident right on its face, because the very same depictions that Mr. Stevens or anyone else swept up under the statute wants to portray, they can -- they can do it, so long as they use simulated or images.",
  "I don't think so, for two reasons. I think what Congress is dealing with with the exemptions clause in this statute was just reflecting the underlying nature of the market that they saw in 1999, a for-profit commercial market in cruelty. And so they exempted educational depictions, religious, and so on, because that wasn't what was driving the underlying market for crush videos - -",
  "And often they will fall under that exemption. My point is that Congress carved a broad exemption in Section 48 precisely to make sure that expressive messages aren't swept up.",
  "The line will sometimes be difficult to draw, just as its difficult to draw in child pornography - -",
  "Quite to the contrary, Justice Sotomayor. In this -- this Court approved, in Osborne v. Ohio, a statute that's on child pornography, that had the following exemption: For a, quote, \"bona fide artistic, educational, religious, governmental, judicial, or other purpose by or to a physician, psychologist, sociologist, persons pursuing bona fide research studies, a judge or other persons having a proper interest in the material or performance.\" And this Court pointed to that exemptions clause to make the statute constitutional at two -- at two pages in that opinion. And so this Court has already gone down the path of saying these decisions are tough to make on a case-by-case basis, but nonetheless the legislature should have a freer hand to act when it is regulating, not the expressive message, but targeting the underlying content, the -- targeting the underlying production, not the content.",
  "I want to answer your hypothetical, but if I could just have 20 seconds or so to -- to respond more generally to all of these hypotheticals which I think are going to reoccur in the course of our conversation. We believe that Section 48 will have as-applied constitutional challenges that will be inferred from case to case. But what this Court has said is that, in your decision, Justice Scalia, in United States v. Williams, is that we should be careful about that endless stream of fanciful hypotheticals precisely because the test under substantial overbreadth, which knocks an entire act of Congress out on its face, is that there must be a realistic danger that the statute will be applied in -- in the manner the hypothetical suggests. With respect to your bullfighting hypothetical, there is no realistic danger. We have had ten years of experience under the statute. Congress itself said -- the legislative history, which I know will not be of relevance to you but may to others on the Court -- they explicitly exempted Spanish bullfighting and said that is the paradigmatic case of what is educational and artistic and the like.",
  "Spanish depictions of bullfighting - -",
  "Well, that is true because it is educational, and -- and a prosecutor would bear the burden of proof.",
  "And some dogfights certainly are, which is my answer to Justice Sotomayor's question.",
  "We have had ten years of experience, Justice Breyer, under the statute, and we haven't seen those things being chilled. Indeed, Respondents - -",
  "Last year in United States v. Williams, an opinion that virtually every member of this Court joined, including you, Justice Kennedy, this Court said that it would look to the experience, the post-Ferber experience, in prosecuting cases to decide whether or not a -- two terms in the statute, \"promotes\" and \"presents,\" were vague and would raise the - -",
  "Well, actually, Justice Kennedy, the reason that came up in the case is because there were hypotheticals being advanced such as police -- a man who wants to call the police that says that child pornography arrived in my -- in the mail and so on.

  "It may or may not be. There aren't, at least, specific statutes generally dealing with it, but - -",
  "Okay. So - -",
  "In hunting, as well as - -",
  "So let me just, to Justice Ginsburg's question. Not all dogfighting videos are swept up by Section 48. There may be educational videos, along the lines that Justice Sotomayor said, raised which are not swept up. Bullfighting is the same basic thing. It's not that there is a categorical -- a categorical exemption on bullfighting; it is rather that there are certain ones that are educational and not, just like in child pornography.",
  "If it meets the other terms in the statute, right. So commercial and things like that.",
  "Now, with respect to hunting, hunting is generally not considered animal cruelty. And it doesn't - -",
  "That's correct. And to the extent that it is something that resembles the terms of the statute, the language of which is \"maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed\" - -",
  "Yes, sir, Your Honor. I do.",
  "That is the decision you wrote last year in United States v. Williams, which interprets the words \"promotes and presents,\" which you yourself in the opinion said are capable of a wide variety of meanings.",
  "And -- and here the word \"kill\" in context is a term that the statute - -",
  "It means killed in the context of a statute that is defining the words \"animal cruelty,\" and this Court has consistently said that the definition that is being defined by the legislature - -",
  "And the legislature under no way, shape, or form was targeting that.",
  "Well, I think that it basically did say that by using the words \"animal cruelty\" in the statute. Now, if there's a disagreement about that - -",
  "Justice Scalia, in Leocal, this Court defined the term \"crime of violence,\" which the INA had -- that the INA interpreted wrongly.",
  "That's - -",
  "And it could have been done in Williams. It could have been done in the child pornography cases, which also have vague terms. But what this Court has said is that using the substantial overbreadth doctrine to do that leaves gaping holes in place. If we followed your invitation, Justice Breyer, we would leave crush videos unprotected.",
  "Well, here I think we should give Congress some credit, because what it actually did in the exemption clause was borrow this Court's own jurisprudence from the obscenity context on exceptions like literary, artistic, political and scientific. It had found that - -",
  "Well, I think it would be complicated because Congress would have to find that by targeting the underlying videos but leaving alternative simulated mugging videos in place, somehow it would have reduced the market for muggings or something like that. I think that's very hard. And it goes to Justice Ginsburg's question about whether this statute is aimed at the communicative of impact, which we don't think it is, or it is aimed at just reducing the first order problem which is - -",
  "So dog fighting is illegal in all 50 states along with crush videos. I don't think that -- there may be - -",
  "Right. This Court has dealt with that in footnote 19 of Ferber in which it said that just because something is legal somewhere else, it's often very hard to figure out where the underlying material is made. It doesn't have a GPS component.",
  "This is -- I'm sorry if I'm not following the hypothetical. This is historical - -",
  "Right.",
  "Well, it sounds like it would fall under the historical exemption, at least in the hypothetical as you have raised it. So, it wouldn't be prohibited by section 48 - -",
  "Well, I think that -- I think that there again, it would raise some First Amendment interest in suppressing historical -- historical information. Now, Justice Scalia, you said who knows. I think the answer to that is that this statute places the burden of proof on the government in order to -- in order to prove that there is no historical or educational value.",
  "Justice Scalia, I do think that is the Court's own jurisprudence with respect to, for example, obscenity and child pornography, both of which this Court has accepted precisely those types of exceptions.",
  "Well, I don't believe the Court has actually read child pornography to be obscenity. The rationale of Ferber - -",
  "Let me say two things about that. First Mr. Stevens, of course, even in the Japan videos you mentioned, he sent his dogs to Japan to -- to fight. And this statute encompasses real time transmissions of - -",
  "It was, just -- again, like child pornography and the like. The second - -",
  "I agree with that. And I don't think that's what underlay either this Court's Ferber decision or the free speech coalition. The move that Ferber makes is to say that the legislature can target the underlying loaded production, so long as it leaves alternative mechanisms for that same exact message to be spoken. And this statute does that. Mr. Stevens can produce the exact same message, just as long as he doesn't involve the torture or mutilation to an actual living animal. And to compare this - -",
  "And Congress hasn't stamped that out.",
  "With simulated messages, the written word. He has written an entire book about that. He has a whole variety - -",
  "Simulate -- absolutely. This statute leaves that in place, Justice Scalia. That's the key to understanding why this statute is not like the traditional statutes that come before this Court in which the government asserts some paternalistic interest and says viewers can't see this because of the offense of the message. This statute has nothing to do with the offense of the message. It has to do with trying to dry up an underlying market for animal cruelty. If the there are no questions, I would like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "There is one analytic move Congress made in Section 48, which is simple and obvious, and it explains why both the human sacrifice channel is constitutional, as well as Section 48 itself. That is the logic of Ferber. When Congress tries to dry up a market for underlying cruelty by targeting depictions and leaves alternative mechanisms for that expression in place, the legislature has latitude. When the statute is not aimed at the communicative impact of the message, like the Hitler video, but, rather, is aimed at reducing underlying acts of exploitation, that is an area which Congress has great leeway.",
  "I'm saying that, if Congress identified a market and if a video -- if the snuff video market was driving, somehow, people to get killed, Congress would be fully within its power to regulate it.",
  "That's precisely correct, but, here, Congress did find an overwhelming market in animal cruelty, and the State attorney's general that filed a brief before you saying that Section 48 is a success story, that it dried up 3,000 crush videos, that it has reduced the market for animal - -",
  "There -- there haven't been any prosecutions for crush videos, and I think the reason is because the market dried up very quickly after the enactment of Section 48.",
  "Oh, no. If there is an underlying argument - -",
  "I think that does start to reach into questions about obscenity and expressive impact on viewers, which is not before this Court. Congress is not resting its judgment here on something saying these images are repulsive and can't be seen. Rather, it is saying - -",
  "Again, that raises a whole different set of questions under obscenity and expressive impact that isn't before the Court here. Now, if I could return to, Justice Stevens, you had he wasn't clear on the position on hunting. I want to be very clear on this. Hunting, like the other hypotheticals, is not covered by section 48 for two reasons: First, the statute -- the statute's term \"animal cruelty\" should be defined to encompass torture, mutilation and the like, and not simple acts of ordinary hunting, most of which, by the way, are legal anyway under animal cruelty.",
  "And again, Justice Scalia, as I said before, I think that comes within a definition of animal cruelty. That's the term being defined. And just as this Court has defined, for example, crimes of violence to exclude certain things that otherwise would be within the statute, such as drunk driving offenses in the context of the IMA, a similar result is possible here, particularly because of the doctrine of constitutional avoidance. And, so, we are saying that if this Court were to write an opinion that made clear that these things are outside of the purview of section 48, there would be no chilling effect, and you wouldn't have to - -",
  "It would have to be for a reason of animal cruelty or something like torture, mutilation and the like. So there may be certain hunting examples that fall within it - -",
  "No, it has nothing to do with the motive, it has to do with what happens to the animal. And, so, there could be images of hunting which are not really hunting, like the images in this case.",
  "Justice Scalia, with all due respect, I think the images in this case and what Congress was getting at was not shooting a little low. These are the most horrific images that you can imagine of cruelty to living animals. And that's what Congress - -",
  "And my point if those -- if there are those cases at the area -- at the gray areas, that is perfect for as applied challenge, but it's not what this Court -- this Court shouldn't be blessing the Third Circuit's decision to in toto invalidate an entire statute which has produced -- which has produced 3,000 crush videos and the like.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: This Court's decision in Buckley v. Fitzsimmons the question presented today, which is whether a cause of action exists against prosecutors alleged to have fabricated evidence. Respondents' answer to this question asks this Court to announce for first time ever that there is a free-standing due process right not to be framed. That theory would untether due process from the right to a fair trial, which is the process a defendant is due before being deprived of liberty.",
  "Respondents' primary submission before this Court is not that argument. They don't rest --",
  "Right, and with respect to that I think we have several, several responses. The first is that this Court has rejected that kind of mere foreseeability analysis in the context of section 1983.",
  "I think there are practical and conceptual problems, which is why Buckley reserved precisely this question in footnote 5, and here's the basic policy or conceptual concern. Our point is that if a section 1983 defendant is absolutely immune for the constitutional wrong, then you can't read back in time; a plaintiff can't look back in time and isolate some other acts as to which they are nonimmune and thereby - -",
  "And, Justice Breyer, I'm saying to do that requires you to read the due process violation as occurring sometime before the trial, and then we're back to the free-standing rationale and the opening up of the due process clause to something this Court has never, ever accepted.",
  "The conceptual problem is that this Court has been explicit that section 1983 is not the font of tort law. Rather, you need to isolate a constitutional violation. Here, the constitutional violation is the due process clause. That violation begins, as this Court's decisions in Napue and Pyle say, when the fabricated evidence is introduced at trial in order to secure a conviction.",
  "Because the policeman essentially induces the prosecution at an earlier point of time and acts through the innocent agent, the prosecutor, that introduction of evidence at trial is not something as to which the policeman has any sort of absolute immunity. And so in Justice Breyer's example of a prosecutor introducing evidence, that is something as to which the prosecutor is absolutely immune. That is where the constitutional violation begins.",
  "Right.",
  "And if the prosecutor does know, we don't think that there is a Fifth Amendment due process violation.",
  "Against -- against the policeman in that circumstance, because the - -",
  "And I agree that that seems a little odd - -",
  "No, what I'm saying and what this Court's decisions have said is that absolute immunity doesn't exist to protect bad apples. It reflects a larger interest in protecting judicial information coming into the judicial process. And if prosecutors have to worry at trial that every act they undertake will somehow open up the door to liability, then they will flinch in the performance of their duties and not introduce that evidence. And that is the distinction between the police officer, who is liable, and the prosecutor, who is -- who is absolutely immune.",
  "Justice Sotomayor, we absolutely want to send that message. The worry is that allegations of wrongdoing, as this Court has recognized in Imbler and Van de Kamp, can -- can supersede that. And just to give you - -",
  "I believe that is correct, and I also believe that no ethics complaints were ever brought. That is, rather the Respondents went into Federal court seeking money damages instead of ethics violations and the like.",
  "Well, I do think that there is a debate in the briefs before this Court, including the brief by 12,400 or so prosecutors that takes the reverse view. But be that as it may, I think that is a question for the legislature. This Court has said repeatedly that those ethics and disciplinary violations are -- are a successful deterrent, and there is others as well that this Court has pointed to that may be available, including counsel's liability.",
  "Well, with respect to a cause of action and whether the principles of absolute immunity apply to this, I think this Court has already recognized several times that the overriding interest is protecting the judicial process and not letting information be chilled and not come in. To give you a couple of data points, there were 14.4 million arrests in the year 2006 and 1.1, approximately, million felony convictions. Respondents' theory would allow prosecutors in any of those circumstances to be sued for an alleged fabrication of evidence, and that's something that could be -- that's something that's not that hard to envision, since criminal evidence, unlike civil evidence, is messy. It often involves cooperation agreements, leniency agreements and the like, and for that reason it's very natural, and this Court has recognized that in Imbler, for the defendant in a criminal case to say: Well, I'm going to blame the prosecutor; they fabricated evidence, they made this story up; and -- and then seek civil liability. And what this Court has said repeatedly is that the societal interest suffers. And that is why it's not about, Justice Kennedy, protecting the bad apple and someone who exacerbates the harm by carrying the fabricated evidence through trial. Rather, what this Court's absolute immunity decisions consistently reflect is the principle that when someone is introducing evidence at trial, you don't want to chill them in the performance of their duties in any way through the rubric of civil liability.",
  "When -- when the evidence is introduced and it's the prosecutor himself who developed that evidence, maybe through flipping a witness or something like that, that - -",
  "Well, he would know whether or not it's fabricated, but the question is whether he would know that he could insulate himself from an allegation of wrongdoing. And Respondents' theory, which allows the due process clause to be some sort of free-standing right, would permit those suits even at the earliest stages of an investigation and permit strike suits even before the criminal process is underway. And that, I think, is a fundamental point, which is this Court, no court has, ever really accepted the notion that prosecutors can be liable, that there is a cause of action for - -",
  "For purposes of absolute immunity, and we agree with that. So, for example, Justice Stevens, in your Fourth Amendment decision in 1975 on the Seventh Circuit, we agree there is liability when a prosecutor is, for example, conducting a raid or something like that. There the constitutional violation is complete before the trial, and whatever the prosecutor does at trial - -",
  "Well, we think there is no liability for pretrial conduct, and so long as you agree with me that the due process clause violation begins only at the trial - -",
  "The -- the text of the due process clause says the deprivation of life, liberty, property with -- under due process of law, and due process under this Court's decisions is what happens at trial, not before.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As the questions I think reveal, I think the bottom line question in this case is whether or not under the text of Title VII there was a present violation in each of the 11 rounds of hiring when the City of Chicago relied on its concededly discriminatory test to exclude the plaintiffs from consideration. And we think that Title VII has three mutually reinforcing provisions in it, each of which point to the same conclusion. A violation of Title VII occurred in this case when Chicago, in each of those 11 rounds, used its hiring practice with -- and caused a disparate impact, thereby limiting the employment opportunities of certain applicants. Chicago gave an ability test and relied on that ability test in a way that Title VII forbids. It took action upon the results of that discriminatory test in a way that arbitrarily excluded qualified applicants from being hired. Justice Alito, I think -- in response to your question, I think our position follows entirely from the text of the statute. We’re not as concerned about the policy consequences, though we do think that if the Court were concerned about the policy consequences, we think that there’s a good reason why Congress distinguished between disparate treatment and disparate impact litigation. But it's the language of Title VII itself, and in particular 703(h), which forbids action upon the results.",
  "I agree that there -- there might be policy arguments against it as well as for it, but here's the way I think we look at it -- and the United States is the nation's largest employer, and we face similar concerns. We give certain tests. But I think what might have been -- what was probably animating Congress was a fear that if the rule of the City of Chicago were adopted, then an employer who made it 300 days without an EEOC charge being filed, 300 days after the announcement of the test results, would then be able to for all time use that discriminatory test, and it would lock in that period, that test, for as long as 10, 20 years, and Congress could have legitimately worried about if a test made it 300 days, an employer essentially had a get-out-of-jail- free card to use for all time. And I would say that that precise thing appears to have happened in this very case. At Joint Appendix page 54, when the City announced its test results in January of 1996, it said it intended to use this test for only 3 years through 1999. Afterwards, 1999 came, the City, in the City's own briefs -- this is the court of appeals brief at page 12 -- they admit they made a new decision to continue using this test and the test results for subsequent hiring rounds. That was a new decision, and indeed that's a decision, I think, many employers would logically make after 3 years, because then they don't have to worry about the possibility of a disparate impact lawsuit. And since, as this Court said in Ricci, one of the goals of Title VII is really to encourage voluntary compliance on the part of employers, adopting a rule like the City of Chicago's is really antithetical to that, because then it will essentially lock in for all time that old discriminatory test. I think another reason policy -- another policy reason Congress may have thought about is that a rule that forced people to file within 300 days might be damaging to the EEOC and divisive to employers, because it would say you only have that 300-day period to file, even before all the consequences of the -- of the -- of the employment decision are fully understood.",
  "The first charge was filed, I believe, 420 days after the January 26th announcement of the test results. And, yes, Justice Kennedy, then there was a period of discovery and litigation over business necessity and the like. And in this case, the City admitted in other litigation that there was no basis for giving this 89 cutoff score, that a person who scored 65 was just as likely to succeed as a firefighter as a person who was -- who had scored 89. Justice Stevens, you had asked about the remedy in the case, and here's how we understand the way remedies work in disparate impact litigation: It's largely injunctive in nature. It's mostly about preventing future problems. There is a back pay claim that is available that is statutorily capped at 2 years. Not everyone in this 6,000-person class could get that full amount of back pay obviously. Instead, what happened here, there was a remedial phase at trial, and what they did was they decided that -- the experts on both sides admitted that 132 people, approximately, would have been hired out of that class, and that provided the appropriate amount of back pay.",
  "I think it was 132 undifferentiated people, and then I think there -- and Mr. Payton can, I think, fully explain how the randomization of awards was allocated.",
  "Right. And --",
  "Right. And, Mr. Chief Justice, to respond to your concern before, that amount of money is not -- you couldn't go back and look to earlier periods of time outside of the statute of limitations, outside of the 300-day period, rather only any subsequent use. For example, in this case the remedy couldn't look to the first round of hiring because no lawsuit was brought within that first round of hiring. It was brought at the -- it was brought after the second round of hiring.",
  "That is --",
  "That's exactly correct, Justice Scalia.",
  "Let me say two things: First is I think (h)(2) refers to \"action upon the results,\" and that thing happened in 10 years is itself action upon the results, and so I think as a statutory matter the language decides it. Now, with respect to the policy reason, I think the reason is that otherwise Congress had to fear precisely what you’re saying, that an employer 10 years from now would use that discriminatory test, because they knew they had made it past the 300-day initial phase of time, and then could use it for all time. And so the statute of limitations and the concerns about repose work hand in hand with other concerns of Title VII, and in particular incentivizing employers to ensure voluntary compliance with the law of Title VII, and which this Court said in Griggs, the goal of which is to eradicate discrimination from the United States' labor markets.",
  "That is -- that is -- that is the benefit of that particular back pay limitation, yes. But in a case like this, where the City knows very well, this test is discriminatory and, indeed, has said so in litigation, I think Congress wanted to incentivize and make sure there was an ability for people to sue at each time that discriminatory test was used. If there are no further questions.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We agree that the plain text controls this case and there are three features to that text. First, section 153(b) permits delegation of any or all of the board's power to three or more members. Second, that section sets out a general quorum rule of three members. And third, as Justices Alito -- Justices Alito, Kennedy and Ginsburg have pointed out, there is the phrase \"except that\" in the rule, a special quorum provision that sets up panel quorums at two members.

There was a vacant third position. And there were 2 years of debate, contentious debate, as you alluded to before, about Taft-Hartley, and yet they left that piece intact.

  "Well, I think the politics in Armageddon could cut different ways, depending -- I mean, these are nomination battles that are focused on individual personalities. And, Justice Scalia, the only empirical evidence we have -- this is not the first time the board has done this, contrary to my friend's suggestion earlier. In 2005, the board was faced with the exact same situation. The board was going to go down to two members. They decided to do the exact same delegation and give -- give all the powers to a group of three, and four days later, Congress fixed the problem with the president.",
  "No, it suggests that they thought three was optimal, where it was -- where they could get three bodies. But here, when they only have two -- and again, faced with shutting down and not deciding the lion's share of cases, which aren't the controversial ones that give rise to the disagreement, Justice Alito, that you were positing -- they've decided to go and do it -- and do their business and try and resolve these. And they have done, I think -- the corpus reveals a really remarkable job at reaching agreement in a large number of cases on the basis of existing precedent. Are these decisions -­",
  "I believe that there is 586 or so decisions that they have rendered, and of those they have set aside about approximately 70. It was 65 as of a few days ago and it's gone up, because they involve questions about overturning precedent or novel issues, and so they haven't reached agreement in those.",
  "If -- if -- if the board is disabled?",
  "Well, if there is -- if there is no board, then I take it the cases would get stuck after the ALJ. There is nothing to take exception to, and so I'm not sure they could go directly to the court of appeals, because the statute, 160(f), I think, doesn't permit review from an ALJ decision directly up. It permits review only of the board's decisions. And if there is no board decision, then presumably these cases get stuck until we have a three-member quorum.",
  "Well, the -- the board only went down to two members as a whole starting in 1993. It has happened four times: In 1993 for 2 months; in 2001, I believe for 1 month; in 2005 for only a few days.",
  "The 460 cases were between 1935 and 1947.",
  "In -- in -- in 1993 and in 2001, the board didn't do this, because those were short periods of time. In 2005, they did do precisely what they did here, but Congress resolved the situation, so there are only about 6 cases decided in that 4-day period. And now from 2007 to now, approximately 586 cases or so have been decided.",
  "They never delegated -­",
  "Absolutely. We are not standing -­",
  "It could have, but it's not -­",
  "Absolutely. It's not optimal, Justice Scalia, to have two. But if -- if the choice is shutting down or going with two, the board made the choice in this circumstance to go with more. And, Justice Breyer, you had mentioned before the change in the word \"except that,\" and I do think that that is crucial language, because that is a subordinating conjunction. And what it does is essentially modify that. The two-member quorum language modifies what happens before, the \"at all times\" -­",
  "Precisely.",
  "Precisely correct. You need it grammatically because otherwise if you didn't have something like that, it would suggest that the panel quorum would be three as well. But -- but the language is quite specific on this and, contrary to what the D.C. Circuit found, \"at all times\" is modified by that subordinating conjunction in the phrase that follows.",
  "The -- the ALJ is appointed by the board and they essentially write tentative decisions that the board, as I understand it, can approve or disapprove. Exceptions can be taken by litigants up to the board.",
  "Well, I -- and this goes to Justice Scalia's first question of the argument, I -- I think that it's possible. I think that there is -- the D.C. Circuit's reasoning is -- potentially could be read so broadly as to say that the entire board goes poof and everything under it, including the salaries. I think if the Court were inclined to -- to write a decision like that, we would try to look to, as you mentioned before, the de facto officer doctrine and the specific language of the delegations to the ALJ's and the specific language to the general counsels, to try to see if there is a way to preserve all of the board's action in this circumstance. Of course, that isn't before the Court at this point, but I understand that the dramatic consequences, potentially dramatic consequences of the D.C. Circuit's ruling, may inform the judgment.",
  "In the absence of any further confirmations or other appointments, one of the members, Member Schaumber, will leave on August 27th of this year.",
  "There will.",
  "There are three nominees pending right now.",
  "Yes. And they have been pending. They were named in July of last year. They were voted out of committee in October. One of them had a hold and had to be renominated. That renomination took place. There was a failed quorum -- a failed cloture vote in February. And so all three nominations are pending. And I think that underscores the general contentious nature of the appointment process with respect to this set of issues.",
  "The -- the recess appointment power can work in -- in a recess. I think our office has opined the recess has to be longer than 3 days. And -- and so, it is potentially available to avert the future crisis that -- that could -- that could take place with respect to the board. If there are no other questions -­",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Millions of employees today use technologies of their -- of their employers under policies established by those employers. When a government employer has a no-privacy policy in place that governs the use of those technologies, ad hoc statements by a non-policy member cannot create a reasonable expectation of privacy. Put most simply, the computer help desk cannot supplant the chief's desk. That simple, clear rule should have decided this case. Instead, the Ninth Circuit found that the 1999 policy applied to pagers, but then concluded that that 1999 policy was informally modified years later. And that decision should be reversed. It disregards this Court's repeated holdings, including 2 years ago in the Chief Justice's opinion in Engquist v. Oregon about the greater amount of leeway that the government has when it acts as an employer. And it also is not consistent with the plurality opinion in O'Connor, which observed that when the government adopts a policy that its employees lack privacy, no reasonable expectation of privacy exists.",
  "So the question is if the Stored Communications Act is violated?",
  "We don't think the Stored Communications Act was --",
  "Oh, absolutely not. I mean, I think this Court has repeatedly said that -- that various privacy laws don't determine the scope of the Fourth Amendment. I think it said so most clearly in California v. Greenwood. And I think that's for a very simple reason, that things like the Stored Communications Act, Justice Kennedy, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, came about --",
  "I -- I do think it’s the same, and for this simple reason, that when you have a nationwide standard or a State standard, it’s to fill the gap, whatever isn’t necessarily protected by the Fourth Amendment. And here --",
  "Absolutely, Justice Kennedy. I don't disagree with that. I think the only question is, if the -- if I understand your question it’s, does a Federal statute about privacy somehow matter to the Fourth Amendment analysis about reasonable expectations of privacy? And there our contention is, no; it’s precisely because Congress enacted the Stored Communications Act to fill gaps in Fourth Amendment law. That -- that's why it's enacted. And for -- for this Court to then use that very Act to be the template on which reasonable expectations of privacy may spring I think would be a very -- it would be a novel proposition. Nor should --",
  "Well, Justice Alito, I do think that the underlying premise of your question is one with which we entirely agree. These are technologies that are rapidly in flux, in which we don't have intuitive understandings the way we do about, say, trash and so on. And it's precisely for that reason I think the Court should be very careful to constitutionalize and generate Fourth Amendment rules in this area at the first instance. To do so I think really does freeze into -- into -- into place something that the legislature can't then fix, going to Justice Kennedy's opinion in, for example, Murray v. Giarratano, in which he said that constitutionalizing in that area -- constitutionalizing may pretermit legislative solutions. Now, here the Stored Communications Act is not violated under any way, shape, or form. The Stored Communications Act has two different provisions in it, one having to do with remote -- remote computing services, RCSs. That's when an entity offers storage facilities. And the other is for an electronic communications service. That is essentially transmission of messages from point to point.",
  "Well, I think that the -- the best way -- I think the most -- the easiest way for the Court to resolve this is to simply say that when we are dealing with what is reasonable, we look to the policy. And here there’s a policy by the employer, it says that computer-associated -- computer-related equipment and others, there’s no expectation of privacy. You have a person who is told that repeatedly.",
  "Well, I think the clearest way, Mr. Chief Justice, to decide what is reasonable and what isn't is actually the terms of the policy. And it seems to me very little is more unreasonable than expecting a right to privacy after you’ve been told in a policy you have no privacy.",
  "Absolutely. There are two arrows in the city's quiver, and I think they're right as to both of them. But --",
  "The government's position is that the Ninth Circuit just from the get-go got the standard wrong by citing -- by using a Schowengerdt test which was, was this -- was this search the least restrictive alternative? And we think this Court has repeatedly said that's the wrong way of thinking about it, that that puts judges in the position of second-guessing searches on the ground, that they’re not really fully -- fully equipped to do so. So I do think that is a possible way to resolve this, Justice Scalia, but --",
  "Well, I don't know that it's easier, in the following sense: I think that thousands of employers across the country rely on these policies and millions of employees. And the Ninth Circuit's decision puts that reliance in some jeopardy, because it said that you can have an official policy and it can be taken back by what some ad hoc subordinate says. And that is, I think, a very destructive notion to the idea of reliance on these policies and setting --",
  "To the -- under this policy, yes. You might have an employer that sets a different policy and allows for some de minimis use and a zone of privacy in that use. You can have a variety of different things. But what I think would be dangerous is to have a blanket rule that constitutionalizes and says you always have reasonable expectations of privacy in this technology. The result may be, Mr. Chief Justice, that employers then won't give that technology at all to their employees and -- and eliminate even that de minimis use. Mr. Chief Justice, you had also asked before about the standpoint of Quon in -- in evaluating the reasonableness of the search -- of the search in his perspective of the policy. We think that is the wrong way of looking at it. Instead, we think the proper test is the written policy, what it says, and that is the simplest way, I think, to provided administrability to the lower courts. They can simply say was this policy in existence, and not get into those questions of is it like a parking ticket, did I flip through it too quickly, did I understand that the policy and the like.",
  "Not at all, Justice Sotomayor. I take it the language about operational realities in the workplace, what is right next to it is looking to whether or not there are regulations in place, and here a policy is a regulation. And so --",
  "And I think that is -- that is what O'Connor says with respect to the -- as long as the policy is in place, that -- that's what O'Connor permits.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Background checks are a standard way of doing business. The Government has required them for all civil service employees since 1953 and for contractors since 2005. If the Ninth Circuit in this case held that a constitutional right to informational privacy precluded asking the questions it asked, that was wrong for two basic reasons. First, the background checks' mere collection of information with accompanying safeguards vitiates no constitutional privacy interest. These checks have been going on for millions of employees for dozens of years. They are part of the employment process. They are manifestly not roving checks on random individuals. And, second -",

  "I quite agree, Justice Ginsburg. That's what I was trying to say to Justice Sotomayor; that is, I think that this case doesn't force the Court to answer questions it has never really answered, which are the outer limits of what the Government can do in terms of the collection of information. Here you have a narrow decision by the Ninth Circuit, one whose reasoning, I think, could radiate very broadly and undermine Government -- the Government's background checks generally.",
  "It's only -- it's at the preliminary injunction stage. But our -- our point is that the reasoning that the Ninth Circuit used, if adopted -- if adopted to create a permanent injunction, could preclude the Government from asking all sorts of questions in background -- in background checks, not just the ones it isolated here, but more general ones, because the Ninth Circuit decision is essentially a how-to manual on how to question, various individual questions, and micromanage them and inject Federal courts into - -",
  "That's -- that's all that the Ninth Circuit ruled on at the preliminary injunction stage.",
  "Which question? The drug treatment question?",
  "Well, there's a -- the mandate has been stayed - -",
  "-- so we haven't been able to - -",
  "That's exactly correct.",
  "Exactly, Justice Kennedy. And if this Court were to embrace that reasoning -- and this is my answer to you, Justice Ginsburg, as well - - then it doesn't just reach drug treatment. I could imagine other litigants doing it for other forms of questions, whatever they may be.",
  "Thus far, that's correct. But I could imagine other litigants coming in, and maybe not just with respect to these questions but questions on SF-85P or Form 86, any number of other things.",
  "Justice Scalia, our position is that the Court doesn't need to answer that question. It's just like Whalen, because in Whalen this Court assumed the existence of some sort of constitutional right and then said: Is that right violated here?",
  "I agree - -",
  "I agree that in many other contexts, it might not be appropriate, but here I think there are some good reasons why. This Court has had special reticence to the rule broadly in the range of privacy, and I think the reason is privacy is something that is in flux in ways that other things aren't, both in terms of our social understandings, technology, and legislation itself. And for that reason, I think this Court has spoken narrowly whenever it's dealt with - -",
  "Justice Scalia, that's what this Court has done throughout its history. And Whalen was a unanimous decision, and Nixon, on that particular question, I don't think there was a disagreement about. So - -",
  "Well, I think it would just be like in Whalen itself. So in Whalen, the Court said there might be some right to informational privacy, but so long as there are safeguards on the disclosure, the Government's dissemination of the information, that means that there is no - -",
  "No, that's not our position. Our position here is that the Government can collect information so long as it is not disseminated in the employment context. And this case, unlike Whalen, is one that has that added fact to it, that the Government here is asking - -",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "Surely -- we are restricted by statute, the privacy of - -",
  "If you assume - -",
  "Absolutely. If we took out all of the safeguards that are at issue here, then the case wouldn't be like Whalen or Nixon, in which you had those -- in which you had safeguards in the dissemination. And then you would have to confront the question, which we think you shouldn't confront in this case, for the reasons I said to Justice Scalia.",
  "Right.",
  "Right. I mean, our position is that the Court really shouldn't, for all of the reasons I said, get into it, but if the Court had to get into it and ask is there some constitutional right that would be violated, Justice Kennedy, by your hypothetical, our answer would be no. But we do think the way that this has been traditionally been handled is legislation. Safeguards for political processes - -",
  "Well, in the employment/proprietor context. Okay? So if the Court had to confront that question, it would apply the matrix that Justice Scalia has talked about, the Glucksberg matrix, of whether a right -- the right is firmly rooted in the traditions of the people, and -- and ask: Is the Government's collection - -",
  "I think there is some right. The question about whether it employs in the unique employment/proprietor context is one the Court hasn't confronted, and our strong -- our strong position here is the Court shouldn't confront it.",
  "Sure. No, there are limits, and I should have said this earlier. If the Government's collection of information or the disclosure of the information burdens some other fundamental constitutional right, that is certainly one limit. So if the Government were collecting information, Justice Alito, on sexual practices of its employees, it may burden the exercise of other rights.",
  "Right. So - -",
  "I do think that if the private employer -- the private employers are a good template. If the Government is simply mirroring what private employers do, as Justice Scalia said in O'Connor v. Ortega, that's a good suggestion that what it's doing is reasonable. Now, to the extent, Justice Alito, that they are gradating far beyond what private employers do, in terms of asking about eating habits and the like, I do think that that may pose -- that there may be some limits. The Court doesn't need to confront that here. It simply needs to look at the Ninth Circuit's decision, which recognize a broad, free-standing right against informational collection of its employees to make sure and -- and realize that that is a serious problem for the way the Government does business.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "That's precisely correct.",
  "It's certainly possible, Justice Scalia. I think that all of these hypotheticals are enormously interesting, but the - -",
  "The forms themselves were not approved by Congress, but the Privacy Act, which is the main restriction - -",
  "That's absolutely correct. The Privacy Act has been around since 1975, and the Government has collected -- you know, it's been used millions of times, SF-85. It's been used 553,000 times in the last 4 years, and we have not seen the types of disclosure or complaints that I think animate the worry that my friends on the other side are saying.",
  "It is for the good of the employee, so it's a - -",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, the way the question is framed is, first, they are asked, have you used illegal drugs in the last year? And then - - and then, if the answer is yes, provide details and then indicate any treatment or counseling received.",
  "I -- I think that the question itself is vague. Now, the way that our -- that the Office of Personnel Management will process such a form is it will process anything so long as there is information about just drug use on the question - -",
  "No. This is unlike, for example, SF-86, which does ask for treatment and counseling back up to, I think, a 7-year period. So I think this is a much more narrow inquiry, and I think the reason for that inquiry is to help the employee. The Government -- the background investigation - -",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think that that's the type -- that that's the type of inquiry that this Court rejected in Whalen. Because in Whalen, the whole debate in the court, in the district court below, was, well, if you want to stop doctor prescription mills people from providing too many narcotics, you don't need the names and ages of the patients. We could change the triplicate forms and redact that. But what this Court said on the second page of its opinion was it called that Lochnerian, that Federal courts shouldn't be policing forms and excising or suggesting random different -- you know, a few different words here or there. And here, experts put this form together to try and get at, basically, are you using drugs and are you using treatment which might ameliorate the fact that you had used illegal drugs in the last year.",
  "That is correct, and in preparation for this, we did survey all of the NASA different centers to ask, has treatment ever been used in any sort of way to hurt an employee? And the answer that came back was, no, it has not been used. It has only been used to help. It is to retain someone who did use illegal drugs but is taking steps to mitigate.",
  "Well, the process by which this takes place is the form is filled out. It is ultimately sent to an adjudicator if there is negative information, and that -- and that information is then discussed with the candidate for employment or the employee to see if they have an explanation. And of the times that this has happened, that someone has been denied -- and I think the number is 128 times over the -- over the last 5 years -- none have been denied for a positive answer to drug treatment.",
  "For Federal contractors. That is correct.",
  "Yes.",
  "One hundred and twenty-eight times, the SF-85 process, is my understanding, has been used to deny someone a credential of the Federal contractor - -",
  "For anything. Exactly. About -- and I think there have been about 74,000 contractors that have sought -- sought badges through the SF-85 since - -",
  "That is correct. That is part of -- that is part of the regulations that are in place, so that if someone is denied a credential -- and this is, I think, at Joint Appendix page 180 -- they are told the reason for that denial. They are given an opportunity to explain themselves, and a process is then put in place. There is then also robust appeal and other things that may happen as well. But one thing that doesn't happen, Justice Sotomayor, is that JPL, the contractor, is not told the basis for why the person is denied a credential, that it is private as between the Government -- here, NASA - - and the individual employee. And that is the - -",
  "It doesn't.",
  "It doesn't.",
  "I'm representing that NASA has -- NASA will not and does not use this employee suitability chart to make contractor credentialing decisions.",
  "Well, it's -- it's been hard to actually pin down where it came from. I think it is derived from earlier Office of Personnel Management materials at a time when it listed out what various crimes were. And so some of those things that are on there that are quite salacious are things that OPM, at earlier points in time, looked to, not for contractors, but for Government employees. But I can represent to the Court that NASA does not and will not use this chart for credentialing decisions.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I quite agree with you. I don't think that the Ninth Circuit's reasoning is capable of being ameliorated easily. So we talked before about how the drug treatment was just a narrow part of the Ninth Circuit decision, but this Form 42 -- the invalidation of Form 42, goes to the heart of what the Government does all the time and what all employers do. They ask open-ended questions to figure out whether someone is trustworthy and reliable. I think as Judge - -",
  "I think as Judge Kleinfeld said, that's how law clerks are hired, and that's how baristas at Starbucks are hired. You have to ask these open-ended questions because as an employer, you don't really know what -- where the pressure points or danger spots in an individual application are.",
  "That is not what we're saying. We - -",
  "Justice Sotomayor, the narrow rule is what we said in our petition and what we said on the very last page of our reply brief and all throughout, which is, this Court should simply say what it said in Whalen, which is assuming that there is some sort of right to informational privacy, the -- the use of a background check with accompanying safeguards to collect information doesn't violate any constitutional right to privacy.",
  "I could imagine a circumstance far afield from this one in which the Government's just mere collection of information about sexual practices might burden the exercise of those rights. I'm saying it's not at all present here, but - - and I don't think the Court should get into it. But that's a really different question than the one here, which is: Is there some free-standing right to constitutional privacy that is unburdened by the fact that there are protections against the disclosure of information? Here, the Privacy Act imposes strong protections against the disclosure of information. And so what's left is a very residual interest in the part of the employees.",
  "Well, I could imagine an as-applied challenge to, for example, you know, the hypothetical on sexual practices or whatever. I do think, as Justice Scalia said, the real check on that is the political process check. The fact is that the Government doesn't ask those kinds of questions, and -- and to the extent it ever did, the Court could confront that in an as-applied challenge.",
  "Those questions, Justice Ginsburg, are really the heart of the form. I mean, those are the most -- in many ways the most important questions, because they're the ones that employers have to ask because they don't know the weaknesses in an individual applicant's background.",
  "Well, yes, I mean, I would say a few things. Number one is I think that the concurring judge did -- did, I think, underestimate how important security is there. First of all, there are armed guards when you're coming in. It is not the campus-like atmosphere. It's not like a campus I'm familiar that she described. The information at the debate -- at JPL is sensitive, quite sensitive, both, you know, in terms of scientifically and with respect to our nation's secrets. And I think more important point about this is the badge that the Plaintiffs were seeking access to don't -- doesn't just give them access to JPL. It will also give them other access to all other NASA facilities. And it's such an important credential that it would allow them to get within, for example, 6 to 10 feet of the space shuttle as it's being repaired and readied for launch. So this is a credential not just for JPL and getting onto JPL, but other places as well. If I could reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, you had asked earlier whether this was a narrow decision on just a couple of questions, and I think that the argument that you just heard from my friend illustrates that it's not. He asks for a, quote, \"free-standing right to control information\" - -",
  "Right. And the judgment - -",
  "And the judgment is based on the following rationale -- this is from the Petition Appendix at page 18a from the Ninth Circuit. \"If the Government's actions compel disclosure of private information, it has the burden of showing that its use of the information would advance a legitimate state interest and that its actions are narrowly tailored to meet the legitimate interest.\" Now, that reasoning was used to invalidate a question, as Justice Kennedy said, on Form 42, that employers ask all the time. Banks ask it and the like. And it's a -- and it's used to invalidate parts of a standard form that the Government uses day in and day out and that employers generally use in order to make employment decisions.",
  "Well, no, we're not conceding that at all. I do think we would meet the standard, but our point is it's the same point as in Engquist, in the Chief Justices's opinion in Engquist v. Oregon, which is forcing the Government to have to march into court every time and justify a question here or an employee there or soup clerk here or whatever, all of those different inquiries pose practical burdens on the ability of the Government to operate. And so - -",
  "I think - -",
  "I think that political process ensures that the Government generally has to ask -- has answer that question writ large, but in order for the Ninth Circuit's reasoning to apply, it would permit any individual person here or there to ask the question - -",
  "Well, that's only - -",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I think that's only because the challenge -- or the Petitioners here only challenge certain questions. Now, I could imagine other petitioners challenging other questions.",
  "The drug use piece, but I could imagine all sorts of inquires about other aspects of the form. And, indeed, the rationale, the language that I just read to you is a road map for anyone to be able to come in and say, well, this -- this question isn't -- isn't necessary for me because I got a background clearance before, I'm rehired, or whatever. And it would be a huge practical burden in the same way as recognizing the cause of action in Engquist was a practical burden. Instead, we think what the Court should do here is what it did in Whalen, which is recognize governments collect information all the time, collect - -",
  "The information that can be collected that's released here is governed by the Privacy Act. And so there are -- the appendix to our brief lists out precisely to whom they could be released to, and that has been around since 1975. We've seen virtually no complaints about the Government disclosing this type of background information on the SF-85.",
  "If it is for a -- if it is to further the Government purpose for which the information is collected, it can be distributed to other folks in the Government. There are restrictions on that, so -- and they're specified in the Privacy Act, and they're quite extensive. And to the extent the Court is concerned that there is something that isn't robust enough in the Privacy Act, we suggest that would -- that could wait for an as-applied challenge down the road when information is disclosed. And we don't think it will, but if, heaven forbid, that happens, that's the basis for an as-applied challenge down the road. But here what they're asking you to do is invalidate questions and forms that the Government asks all of its employees and now just wants to ask contractors. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For 13 years, Arizona has permitted private citizens to contribute money to private organizations set up by private individuals and has let those organizations use that money towards scholarships when individuals apply for them. The Ninth Circuit erred first in finding that the taxpayer plaintiffs had standing, and second in striking the program down. On standing, this lawsuit fails each of the three necessary elements. Regarding injury in fact, the key point is this: Not a cent of the Respondents' money goes to fund religion. If you placed an electronic tag to track and monitor each cent that the Respondent plaintiffs pay in tax, not a cent, not a fraction of a cent, would go into any religious school's coffers.",
  "Right, and -­",
  "There are two problems with that. One has to do with injury in fact. The other has to do with redressability. With respect to injury in fact, our point is, as you track the taxpayers' dollars, it doesn't actually fund any religious program, unlike the -- unlike Flast and other cases in which this Court has considered taxpayer standing for religion. Their complaint is not that the government is spending money that the taxpayers has been -- money that has been extracted and spent of the taxpayers. Their complaint is that someone else's money is not being extracted and spent enough. And the relevant language in Flast says that for taxpayer standing to occur, that, quote, \"his tax money\" must be extracted and spent, and here that's not occurring. Now, with respect to the other argument, not injury in fact, but addressability and causation, our point is this: It's speculative as to whether or not that chain of events that you spelled out, Justice Sotomayor, would actually happen. As this Court said in Cuno, for example, when a tax credit is given, sometimes that actually reduces the amount of money the government has to spend. It doesn't increase it. And so that's different than the direct outlay that was at issue in Flast.",
  "Well, let me say two things about that. First is: That is not all that different, Justice Breyer, than what we have today with 501(c)(3) deductions.",

  "I don't think that any taxpayer could challenge that. That is, depending on the hypothetical, Justice Breyer, I'm not sure if the government is specifying which religious organizations might be eligible for the check box. But if the government is doing something that is under-inclusive and only giving tax credits to one set of religious organizations, that's a Texas Monthly problem, where this Court -­",
  "No, Justice Breyer. Two things on that. First is: We're only talking about standing, not the merits. And with respect to standing, if the government funded only religious organizations or religious prayer, I do think that other organizations would have standing -- not as a taxpayer, because this Court has been very careful in Flast and in Hein to say there's an extremely narrow exception for taxpayer standing, a narrow exception to Frothingham, but other organizations would have Texas Monthly standing because they're -­",
  "The way this scheme is set up, our answer is no. And I think that accords with this Court's general reluctance to confer taxpayer standing in this area.",
  "I -- I don't see that, Justice Ginsburg, in Flast. I think Flast is a very narrow exception for when someone's dollars are being taken out of their pocket and spent by the government on religion, and I don't think that's happening here.",
  "Justice Breyer -­",
  "Justice Breyer, I don't think Flast is gone at all.",
  "-- when there is direct government outlays to spend on religion, like Flast. I mean, that -­",
  "Well, I do think that that can get around it -- that can get around it in some circumstances. And, again, those who are under-included in a government program may have standing, not as a taxpayer. But, at the end of the day, Justice Breyer, if that's the result, that's the result for every other clause in the Constitution. Taxpayer standing is the most narrow of exceptions, and -­",
  "Well, I don't see that in Flast, Justice Ginsburg, but be that as it may, I think this Court in Valley Forge was very clear to say that if, at the end of the day, you can't find a plaintiff with standing, that is not an excuse to relax the -- our general requirements of Article III standing. And here, if you granted the plaintiffs standing, what you would be granting is, for the first time, a -- a tax credit which is a complaint about someone else's money not being spent to a high enough level.",
  "Right. So let me say two things about that. First is, I do think it's very much just like Frothingham, in which Frothingham had to deal with this exact problem. The Court had conferred standing in taxpayer standing case after taxpayer standing case, and then, when it was teed up and presented to the Court as a question about Article III standing, the Court said: No, we shouldn't have granted taxpayer standing in those cases. So my answer to you is yes. Now, I do think that this Court's decision in Hein, I think, reiterated some of the fundamental principles and the limits on Flast. And I think the Court -- the plurality made quite clear that it would go no further than the facts of Flast. And to grant standing here, you have to go -- tremendously depart from what Flast is about: a direct government outlay of funds out of -- taking money out of someone's pocket to fund religion.",
  "They -- they could have gone out -- the results may have been the same. It just would have been -- would have been on standing instead of the merits. Mueller, for example, upheld the program. So the bottom-line decision would have been the same, but the way in which the Court got there would have been so that there was no tax -­",
  "No taxpayer standing. Now, there may have been other forms of standing, Texas Monthly standing, that could have been alleged to challenge those programs, but yes.",
  "We did, and in the first footnote -­",
  "The first footnote in the brief, Justice Ginsburg, acknowledged the fact that standing hadn't been pushed or pressed below. But I acknowledge that, particularly in the wake of Hein, should another case arise, the Government will -- will acknowledge the standing defects and brief them as we are here. Our point on redressability is not simply that the -- that the tax -- that the cost of the program is speculative. It's also that the relief that the plaintiffs are seeking in this case won't redress their problem. That is, if you gave the plaintiffs everything they're asking for, the very same religious schools and the very same religious STOs would continue to be funded. The very same religious STOs would continue to be funded because they would leave in place -- and this was my answer to Justice Breyer -- the tax deduction, the 501(c)(3) tax deduction. And so there would still be government revenue being spent in favor of these religious STOs under their program. It would just be at the level of one-third instead of 100 percent. I don't think that satisfies their problem. I don't think James Madison 's remonstrance would be satisfied if they were -- if Madison were told: Well, you're not going to be taxed three pence; you'll be taxed one pence. The principle is what matters, the principle of Flast. If I could reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you. My friend said, I think I have this right, \"we are talking about my clients whose money is being used to fund this program.\" That's a nice description of Flast. It is not a description of what's going on here. Flast recognized a special -- well, a special solicitude for taxpayers when money is taken out of their pocket and used to fund religion against their conscience. Here, even if you accept all of this public money discussion that has been happening, not a cent of their money is going to fund -­",
  "Justice Breyer, two things. First, the relevant language of Flast is at page 106. It's not the nexus test; it's the definition of what the actual taxpayer standing claim is. And it requires that, quote, \"his tax money being extracted was\" -­",
  "And that's the general description, Flast says, about how taxpayer standing will go forward. If there's any doubt about that, Valley Forge makes that clear because the dissenters said exactly what you said, which is, look, let's just look to economic effects, and that alone will be enough. And it's just Property Clause, Tax and Spending Clause, it doesn't really matter; it's the bottom line on the treasury. And this Court said no, that isn't the case.",
  "I disagree on two levels. First is I don't think that's what Flast is. I think Flast is about that micro-fraction of a cent that is coming from your pocket and being used to fund religion. And that's what Madison complained about. It may be very small; it may be 3 pence. But there's a special harm of conscience when it's your money, your hard-earned money, being used to fund a program directly as to which you don't like.",
  "Again, I think that doesn't deal with the direct injury on the taxpayer, which is the language of Flast. Even if we -- even if you disagree with me, the relief -- the harm here is a lot more speculative, just like Cuno, because you have to posit, in order for the harm to exist to this taxpayer, that tax credits will cost the government money, not save it, that his tax burden will go up as opposed to someone else's tax burden, a corporation and the like, or you have to posit that the government won't cut spending in order to make up the shortfall in revenues that he says is going to exist. You're going to have to do all of those things, none of which you have to do in a Flast situation because it's just a direct outlay of funds. If I could just can spend a moment on Justice Kennedy's question about State action, which, of course, they didn't advance below as the Ninth Circuit said. I think this Court's precedents are quite clear in saying that the fact that the government regulates or funds something doesn't transform it into a State actor. If it did, then all 501(c)(3)'s would become State actors, and that, I think, would be an enormously damaging precedent for this Court to follow. Rather, I think what Blum says is that it requires the performance of a traditional executive prerogative -- traditional government prerogative. And here all the STO is doing is just funding -- it's handing out money. It is doing so on a neutral basis. Anyone can form an STO, and anyone can fund one.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Nearly a quarter of a century ago, Congress declared Federal employer sanctions central, not peripheral, to the policy of immigration law. Congress broadly swept away State and local laws, pre-empting any sanction upon those who employ unauthorized aliens, with the sole exception being a mere parenthetical for licensing and similar laws.",
  "First let me tell you, Mr. Chief Justice, what we think a licensing law is and then deal with the \"similar\" question. We think a licensing law, as Congress defined it in IRCA, was the traditional licensing laws that were in place in 1986. Those were largely farm labor contractor laws. They were aimed at fitness to do business, and they had a few essential characteristics in those laws. They -­",
  "Oh, absolutely. And -- but I think that this licensing law looks very different from the ones you were referring to or the farm labor contractor ones, for a number of reasons. The first is licensing laws issue licenses. They're generally about the issuance of licenses, not simply ones in which licenses are revoked. Second, they are ones in which the issuance of the license, the criteria for issuance, is the same as the criteria for revocation, because they're -­",

  "No. I think that the criteria would be the same for issuance and revocation.",
  "Because, Justice Scalia, what Congress was trying to do was preserve the States' and localities' traditional power for fitness to do business. And one good indicia that fitness to do business is not was what at issue in the particular law is that they will let businesses operate, they will license them without any care whatsoever as to whether they have a history of violating the particular provisions -­",
  "Justice Scalia, that would solve that problem.",
  "Now, there are other -­",
  "-- hallmarks of licensing law.",

  "A State could certainly make that part of its genuine fitness to do business law. Now, here Arizona hasn't done that. And we know that because the criteria for issuance of the license are entirely divorced from the criteria for revocation of the license. And if Arizona really believed, Mr. Chief Justice, what you're saying, which is that it's relevant to the -- the violation is relevant to whether they can do business or not, they allow every single one of these entities to get the license.",
  "Justice -­",

  "Right. So that looks like a punishment statute. There are essentially two boxes here. There is the -­",

  "Absolutely. The Federal adjudication is expressly -- State adjudication of a Federal violation is expressly pre-empted as well as impliedly so for three reasons. The first is that Congress, in developing IRCA and the comprehensive scheme, set out a series of procedures, Federal adjudication with an ALJ, all sorts of different regulations to the jot and tittle. And what Arizona does here is what 40,000 different localities can do if this law is upheld, which is have -­",
  "Well, it's undoubtedly the case that without the parenthetical, the mere parenthetical savings clause, that Arizona-like laws would be swept away as sanctions, that these are sanctions imposed. So the question is whether the licensing law phrase saves that. And I think it saves the Federal -- State adjudication, and I think the answer to that is no, because to read the statute that way is to permit all of those States to have their own laws, and it's undoubtedly the case that Congress wanted to sweep away the De Canas-style State statutes that were in place that imposed sanctions on employers. And so the -­",
  "Well -­",
  "Well, I think that the answer depends on what Congress was trying to get at. In 1986, we know what Congress was trying to get at with respect to State enforcement of immigration laws. They broadly swept away the De Canas-style laws, and they said, for the I-9 provision, which President Reagan described as the keystone of the Act, that I-9 documents can't be used in any procedure besides IRCA procedures.",
  "If it has independent adjudication, it is swept away by the first parts of the (h)(2) statute which say -- which say the provisions of this section pre-empt any State or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions.",
  "Because if I understand -- I may not understand the hypothetical, but the word \"provisions\" refers to the entire subset -- the entire statute in IRCA, including the procedural protections -­ the procedures that follow for Federal enforcement of the immigration laws.",
  "Right. And our -- and our position is that this is not a licensing law because it doesn't bear any of the indicia of a traditional licensing law, and -­",
  "No, I don't think so, that Congress -- Congress had in the -- when they used \"similar\" meant to sidestep the schematic debate about whether something is a certificate, as some of the farm labor contractor statutes use that term, or a license.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Two basic things decide this case. First, the government is not affirmatively invoking the power of the Federal court; only the plaintiffs are. It was Mr. Phillips's clients who 20 years ago walked into the Federal court and asked that court to set aside the decision of the contracting officer and to award them over a billion dollars in damages. The government, by contrast, simply asked the court to dismiss the Federal lawsuit.

It should follow the Hippocratic principle of doing no harm.",
  "Absolutely. I don't think we need to go there. I do think that there are special arguments available in this case because it is a contract, as Justice Breyer said, with sophisticated parties who ex ante will decide who bears the burden of coming into court and -- and so on. But here I think this is a simple principle that, in a world in which the court doesn't know who is right and wrong in the superior knowledge defense -- and that's the answer to the question that Justice Sotomayor asked to Mr. Phillips a moment ago about what did the Court of Federal Claims ultimately decide. They didn't decide there was a prima facie case. They said at page 245a of the 2001 opinion: We can't know one way or the other. And so -­",

I think, rather, what all of these decisions say together is if you don't know one way or another, you should return; you should wind the clock back to the status quo ante before the lawsuit was filed. And at that status quo ante, there was undoubted a right of the government to have $1.35 billion. Now, I understand some of you have suggested, well, maybe we should just cut it even and they get to keep the $1.35 billion and we get to keep -­ and we don't have to pay the $1.2 billion.

  "Justice Scalia, let me read to you the contract to which they agreed. It's at Joint Appendix, page 120 to '21: \"If the contract is terminated under the default clause, the contractor shall, on demand, repay to the government the amount of unliquidated progress payments.\" And then, what happened, as a result of that demand letter that we sent right after the -- after the termination for default, was they came to us, hat in hand, and said: Please don't take this money from us right now, our banks are going to complain, and so on. And so we entered into a deferment agreement -­",
  "-- which is at page -­",
  "Joint Appendix page 342. And it seems to me a very odd notion of due process to say that somehow the fact that we agreed to their deferment creates some entitlement for them to keep the $1.35 billion.",
  "I guess I would say two things. One is, if you look -­",
  "Right. And I think if you -- if you were to look to that background common law contract principle, you would look not just to Reynolds but to Tenet -- or excuse me, Totten, which I think makes clear that, at the time they signed their contract, they were on notice that highly classified information that is the subject of -- of litigation is something that generally can't be litigated in the Federal court. And then, if you wanted to think about due process and the overlay of unconscionability or whatever with respect to Federal contracts, you would ordinarily assume that the contract itself from highly sophisticated parties would work that out ahead of time. And so if they were concerned about this situation unfolding, they could have written into the contract that they should get certain information and that if the government invoked the state-secrets privilege, it would automatically terminate the contract's default and convert a default termination into a termination for convenience.",
  "Well, I don't think it comes out as a wash, Justice Kennedy, because I think the contract is undoubtedly clear that, in order to challenge the -- the decision of the contracting officer about a default termination, they have to come into Federal court and invoke affirmatively, seek affirmative judicial relief from the Federal court, to change the world. We don't have to do that.",
  "That is correct. Some of that is at Joint Appendix 137 to 140.",
  "Yes.",
  "I have to say, it is a very odd thing to bid on a highly -- a multi-billion-dollar contract on the assumption that they're going to get some technology that they haven't even specified.

They brought in Lockheed, who -- which had built low-technology -- low-observability planes -­ precisely for the reason that they said they'd have the technology.

The trial has taken place in -­",

  "And then we -- at the weight contracted for, we had warned them that it wasn't, and then later we relaxed to that weight specification. So I'm not sure that is really present one way or the other. But our central submission to you, Justice Scalia, is: If you're not sure, as you were saying to me -- you don't know who is right and who is wrong -­ then the Federal court shouldn't be complicit in the process of siding and picking winners and losers in that circumstance -­",
  "Sure. I could imagine that we could be on a counterclaim, for example.",
  "That's correct. The -- the jurisdiction of the CFC -­",
  "That's correct.",
  "Well, it's a convenient rule, Mr. Chief Justice, that they agreed to when they signed the contract. The CDA was on the books. They knew the deal going in, which is if they wanted to challenge the decision of the contracting officer, they would have to come in. Now, you could have structured it very differently. You could have said we -- you know, that there would have to be -- that -- that if there were a termination for default, it would automatically change into a termination for convenience -­",
  "We have the burden of proof on default, but not on superior knowledge, the precise question here. In their rule, if you -- if you follow their rule, they're asking the court to proceed counterfactually and say that they are entitled to not just the 1.35, but the 1.2 billion on top of that, as if they had proved their superior knowledge claim. And -­",
  "I do agree that that is -­ that's the way the contract is written. It distinguished between those two and distinguished between liquidated payments -- as to which the government has no right in the event of a default termination, and we're not seeking that -- and unliquidated payments, as to which the government has an absolute right at the moment the contracting officer decides there has been a default termination.",
  "Justice Scalia, I am saying leave the parties where they are under the terms of the contract. And -­",
  "Well, that -- Justice Scalia, I don't think that the Federal court should be in the business of micromanaging under the Due Process Clause in a contractual situation with parties that can protect themselves ex ante very easily. I mean, they say -­",
  "So even if you followed that reasoning -- and I don't think you should, for a reason I'll explain in a moment -- but they would still lose, because they still bear the burden of proof and persuasion on superior knowledge, the -- the excuse that's at issue in this case. Now, I don't think that would be the rule, that that's an appropriate rule, Justice Kennedy, because I think underlying Reynolds is this central proposition that a court shouldn't be involved, shouldn't be picking winning -- winners and losers either way, when the state of knowledge is unknowable.",
  "Unable to make the showing in -­",

  "Justice Sotomayor, this is a very important question, and I think that that's the impression left by their briefs and it's wrong. So the filing of their claim -- their claim in the Court of Federal Claims they say vacated the contracting officer's decision. That's wrong under the statute; 605(b) in the -- in the Contracting Disputes Act says that a clause can be put into the contract to continue it in effect and require performance even if there's an appeal to the Court of Federal Claims, and that provision exists in this very contract. So -­",
  "Well, I think it is. It's in a footnote of our reply brief, and it cites to 605(b). And our claim is that -- that that provision requires -- right now we have an absolute entitlement to the $1.35 billion. That is what the contract says. That is what even the deferment agreement says that we've entered into. So we're not asking, Justice Sotomayor, for any affirmative judicial relief at all. We don't need -- we want the Court, as it does in state-secret cases such as Tenet, to stay out entirely and say -- to deny an audience to this case on the merits. And if you do what Mr. Phillips says or if you do what Justice Scalia suggested, the kind of compromise option, that is affirmatively using the power of the Federal court, granting him relief on a claim that he has not proven, and that is something I see -- I see zero precedent for -­",
  "Justice Scalia, we have no -­",
  "Justice -- Justice Scalia, we have no problem with a go-away rule. And if you did that and you returned to the status quo ante, we would have that $1.35 billion. That is what the contract says. That is what their own filing in September 16, 1991, said before the Court of Federal Claims, when they called that $1.35 billion, quote, \"money presently due and owing.\"",
  "Justice Scalia, that seems to me -- that is affirmatively using the power of the Court to set aside the contracting officer's decision, which is what I think is forbidden by Reynolds. And it would be an odd rule, because it's basically a happenstance. If we had just simply insisted on our $1.35 billion at the moment that it was owed to us in February of 1991, we wouldn't even be having this conversation right now. The only reason we're having it is because we acceded to their own request to not take the $1.35 billion right away.",
  "Oh, I think it would be very simple. You could say: In the event the government invokes the state-secrets privilege, any termination for default automatically becomes a termination for convenience. That's one of many.",
  "Do I think the government would?",
  "Well, I think if they don't, Mr. Chief Justice, that underscores the problem with their argument, because they are saying: Read the contract precisely this way, to eliminate terminations for default and convert them all into terminations for convenience when the state-secrets privilege is being invoked. And I agree with you. I think that would be a very unusual contract for the government to get into. That is what they're demanding here, and that's strictly -­",
  "Well -- well, I think there are other ways. There's the possibility that they may demand extra money in exchange for greater risk. There may be that there may be some alternative dispute resolution mechanisms available. I don't know, but I would -- I would -­",
  "Well, it might depend on -­ you might have it within the military, you know, the equivalent of that -- in the Tenet v. Doe, you might have panels like the Helms panel. I'm not sure what the precise contractual arrangements would be. I do think that the need for this Court to be involved is a lot lower than, say, in the criminal context of Reynolds, because the government here is a repeat player with these contractors. They're not in the business, as our deferment agreement, I think, underscores of trying to willy-nilly advance the state-secrets privilege to undermine and take their money away. Indeed, I think since the 2003 Federal Circuit decision, there have only been a couple of instances, at most, in which -- that I'm aware of in which the government has invoked the state-secrets privilege in any sort of contracting action, and nothing like this superior knowledge thing. And since 2009, the government, all together in civil court, has invoked the state-secrets privilege a whopping two times, to -- to my knowledge.",
  "Sure. Justice Breyer, I think that due process is an ill-fitting concept in this contractual dispute for a couple of reasons. Not just can the sophisticated parties agree ahead of time to other things, but also the whole notion of due process in contracts is odd, because the government has waived its sovereign immunity only since 1855. They don't have any freestanding right to come in ab initio and claim fundamental fairness on contracts. I think that is implicit in the Constitution itself, that they don't have that right. And so, the question becomes, is there some extra protection the courts should give here akin to the one in Reynolds about criminal defendants in the government using state-secrets information? And I think the answer to that is \"no,\" because parties can work that out themselves ex ante. And so, my answer to you is -- I think it was option B -- to use the contract as the -- and contractual interpretation as the basic rule for a decision here. The contract itself specified -- and it was done under the shadow of Reynolds and under the shadow of -- of Totten that specified that they would have to be the moving party. They would have to come in and challenge the decision of the contracting officer --",
  "Well, I do think that with respect to this, in this -- you know, thousands-and-thousands-of-page contract, I think that this specific set of issues could have been worked out in advance and, I do think, was worked out in advance. They knew, going in, that they bore the burden of walking into court, paying their attorneys, and everything else, to challenge the decision of the contracting officer. And they also knew at that moment the government had an undoubted right to the unliquidated progress payments. The contract they signed distinguished between liquidated progress payments, as to which the government has no right, and unliquidated payments, as to which default termination automatically gave that to the government. And the argument they're advancing here is, well, let's collapse those two; let's keep the $1.35 billion, because the government hasn't given it to us yet.",
  "Because the contract specified two payment streams. One is the work that they had reviewed and understood and said -- the government had said this is good work, we're going to pay you for it; and other work which are claims that they have made but they haven't actually been approved by the government. And I think Mr. Phillips -- I don't think that there's any sort of evidence that -- or certainly nothing that the courts below found that says that the -- that they had a right to the unliquidated progress payments.",
  "The 1.2 -­",

  "-- keeping 1.35 billion, as I understand it, is costs -- is extra costs incurred under the contract above and beyond the $4.8 billion that was in the initial contract.",
  "It's page 32, and I'd also refer the Court to the court of appeals appendix page 19567, which is the page of the contract itself that incorporates the provision. The provision is FAR 52.233-1(h), and it says that -- it mandates performance and compliance with the contract even when there -- in the contracting officer's decision, even when a decision is under appeal.

  "That's correct.",
  "That's right. At that moment they had to pay. They knew that, and they in fact sent a bank letter and so on -- this is Joint Appendix 329 -- saying please don't do that.

We're asking the Court to simply stay its hand and follow the Hippocratic principle of doing no harm in a world in which the -­ the Court can't decide who's right and who's wrong.",
  "That's absolutely right. The -- the Federal rules and the Contract Disputes Act provide us an offset so that we could -- we don't have to actually seek the 1.35 billion from their coffers, as he colorfully called it, \"reaching into\"; we can just offset it against future contracts, and the Federal courts would be out of the business altogether about that 1.35 billion.",
  "And, again, Mr. Chief Justice, that's the contract to which they signed. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This lawsuit seeks personal money damages against a former Attorney General of the United States for doing his job, allegedly with an improper motive, yet the Attorney General, like the Federal prosecutor in Idaho who sought the material witness warrant at issue in this case, was performing the functions of his office. There are three reasons why the Petitioner should not be personally liable for money damages. The first is because the prosecutor's act of seeking the material witness warrant is integrally associated with the judicial process and entitled to absolute immunity. To view it any other way is to expose both line prosecutors and high officials to lawsuits by highly incentivized litigants based on their purportedly bad motives. That is something this Court has manifestly resisted and for good reason, because improper motives are easy to allege and hard to disprove. Allowing such suits to proceed would result in burdensome litigation and interfere with the ability of prosecutors to do their jobs. The second reason is that the Fourth Amendment was not violated, and, therefore, qualified immunity applied. There can be little doubt that the statutory requirements of section 3144 were met in this case, and, equally, there can be little doubt that the subjective motivations of Attorney General Ashcroft or the line prosecutor are thoroughly irrelevant to whether a Fourth Amendment violation exists. This Court has repeatedly rejected subjectivity, explaining that otherwise time-consuming, vexatious, burdensome, and, indeed, destabilizing discovery and litigation would be the inexorable result. And the third reason, and the easiest reason, is that whatever one thinks the applicable law is, what it -- it was manifestly not the law in 2003 when the warrant in this case was issued by a neutral judge in Idaho.",
  "Oh, no, it -­",
  "Well, I take it there may be a difference. We think the Court should first decide the absolute immunity question, which is the way that this Court has historically handled questions when there's an absolute immunity question and then a qualified immunity. I take it that the qualified immunity question in this case is one about whether motivations matter for the Fourth Amendment; whereas the motivation question in the absolute immunity sense, as Respondents see it, is -- is something broader. It's not limited to the Fourth Amendment, per se. Their argument is if the prosecutor is -- has bad motives essentially or a certain bad motive, an investigatory or purposeful bad motive to engage in preventive detention, that somehow pierces the veil of absolute immunity. That is something this Court has never accepted.",
  "Justice Scalia, to be sure, they are now making that argument in this Court, that this doesn't fall -- this isn't intimately associated -­",
  "-- with the judicial process. Below, of course, they said the reverse: That material witness warrants were associated with the judicial process and that the only difference is that -­ that, here, they had a bad motive. So I've talked about the bad motive point. Now, with respect to whether this is intimately associated with the judicial process, these are material witness warrants being sought in connection with an ongoing investigation by a prosecutor. It is quintessentially a prosecutorial function to obtain these warrants and has been for -- for hundreds of years, and it's the exercise of the prosecutor's professional judgment, which is something that this Court has looked to.",
  "Yes, it was. The indictment of Mr. Al-Hussayen was in February 2003. The prosecutors learned in March that Mr. Al-Kidd was about to board a plane and go off to Saudi Arabia for an unspecified length of time. They then acted immediately. They went to the court and said we need this warrant to secure this testimony. That is, to me, essentially what prosecutors do and protected by Imbler. To see it any other way is to expose prosecutors to lawsuits for -­",
  "Justice Ginsburg, he was in -- he was detained for only a period of 16 days total in 2003. Is -­",
  "He had travel restrictions placed upon him until the trial was over and until the government -- because after the resolution of Mr. Al-Hussayen's case, which was acquittal on some charges and a hung conviction -- a hung -- a hung decision on others, the government thought about retrying Mr. Al-Hussayen, took it very seriously, and 20 days after al-Hussayen's verdict by the jury, we reached an agreement with them in writing that Mr. Al-Hussayen would leave the country and -- and not come back, and in exchange we weren't going to prosecute him any further. And so, immediately -- I think quite soon after the jury verdict, the -- the conditions placed on Mr. Al-Kidd were lifted. And I should say that the material witness warrant statute laces into it a whole suite of safeguards to prevent against -- as, Justice Scalia, you pointed out -- the potential abuse for the -- for material witnesses by prosecutors. I think Congress has set up several different things to prevent that. The first is, in order to get a material witness warrant, the prosecutor needs to show both materiality and then practicability. The second is that there are strict limits placed on the conditions of the -- on the ability of the prosecutor to detain anyone. Section 3142 says that a detention can only be allowed by a judge if, quote, \"no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the individual.\" And then there's a formal procedure where they have a right to counsel, they have the right to cross-examine witnesses, to -- to present evidence, to proffer evidence at the hearing, and the like -- all to show that they shouldn't continue to be detained.",
  "For two reasons. Number one is I think that's the way this Court has historically gone about it, probably for reasons of constitutional avoidance, to not reach constitutional questions if there's an absolute immunity question. And the second is, here, you have a Ninth Circuit decision, Justice Alito, that says that -- that absolute immunity can be pierced by a prosecutor's bad motive. That is something that infects not simply material witness warrant cases but, indeed, virtually any case. As we point out and as the dissent below pointed out, that kind of argument could be run by any defendant who says you didn't intend to actually indict me, or, you didn't care about that, you really wanted to flip me to get testimony against some higher-up. And to allow defendants to make those kinds of arguments and to expose line prosecutors and attorneys general to that form of liability is an extremely damaging proposition. The -- with respect to the Fourth Amendment question about whether or not motive applies, I think this Court has quite clearly said in Whren that motive is not -- is not something that should be looked to, that the subjective motivations of the prosecutor are not -- are -­",
  "Justice Ginsburg, it's certainly different in -- in that respect, but I do think that difference doesn't matter, because I think what Whren and Edmond and the cases were getting at is, is there some objective, individualized determination by a neutral judge? And, here, as I was saying earlier, there is quite clearly that laced into the 3144 statute itself; that is, the judge must find materiality and -­ and impracticability of the testimony. And that is a standard performing, I think, a long-standing government function of making sure that testimony, important testimony, is available at trial. So it is not like a situation in which the government, just on their mere say-so, can put the -­ can detain someone on the basis of them saying, well, we think this person has information. I think there are strict standards placed on that, and, indeed, Federal Rule -- Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 46 adds standards to it by saying that a prosecutor must report to the judge every 10 days about anyone who is detained and assure no more detention is necessary. So that -­",
  "Absolutely, Justice Scalia. I was just answering Justice Ginsburg's question about qualified immunity.",
  "I imagine one point about the statute might be that the statutes, going all the way back to 1789, do reflect that this is a prosecutorial function to the extent there is any doubt. So, for example, the 1846 statute said that an attorney -- excuse me, an attorney of the United States must apply for a material witness warrant.",
  "I think that is correct, that that is quintessentially what prosecutors do in the exercise of trying to get a trial -- a trial going. Now -­",
  "Well, if the -- if the -- I'm not sure I totally follow -­",
  "If the evidence shows that the evidence is not material, then the statute is violated.",
  "I do think that that would generally mean that materiality would be violated. I could imagine -­",
  "-- some theoretical construct -­",
  "Justice Breyer, let me -­ let me -­",
  "-- just make sure that I understand the contours of your hypothetical. I don't think that subjective motivations of the prosecutor go to materiality. So if -­",
  "Here's how I think it works: So I think that Congress set up the objective two-part test to decide whether or not an arrest warrant would take place, which is materiality and impracticability. Now, that isn't subjective; that is simply, does the person have material information that can be used that -- that's relevant to the trial. Now, if the person has a -- the prosecutor has a subjective intent that says I'm never going to use this testimony, then I think that that doesn't -- that will -- that will almost always reflect the fact that materiality just objectively hasn't been met in a given case, but theoretically I could imagine a circumstance in which the prosecutor has that subjective intent but yet is material. With respect to that, Congress has a different safeguard at the back end, in 3144, and that is the language in 3144 that says a judge in the detention hearing is to inquire as to whether or not the detention is necessary, quote, \"if there will be a failure of justice\" if the person is released.",
  "Well, I think that the -­ the defense can litigate that and appeal that set of issues, but I don't think -­",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Well, they did, because we're talking about -­",
  "Exactly.",
  "At the time itself. But I think that's an important point, Justice Scalia. With respect to absolute immunity, this Court has often said that it is the crucible of the trial process itself that often is a safeguard against abuse.",
  "I take it that the logic of this Court's precedence is that absolute immunity would still apply. And the reason for that is that absolute immunity isn't some rule to just protect prosecutors willy-nilly; it's to protect the public. And as this Court said most recently unanimously in the Van de Kamp case, that -- quoting Learned Hand -- that -- that there is a cost to this. No doubt that certain individuals will be harmed, but the cost of rooting out the bad apples through damages lawsuits is far worse, that it causes prosecutors to flinch in the performance of their duties.",
  "No, I do think it goes quite a bit further than that. I think it -- and I think Burns v. Reed -- and the relevant language is at page 492 -- I think is -- is relevant because it says that it's pretrial conduct, in order to secure the testimony for trial or the like is -- is what is protected as well, that it would be far too narrow to just focus on the trial itself; and that would be the contours of absolute immunity. I think Justice Kennedy's opinion in Buckley is also instructive in this regard, because what that opinion says is that allowing only immunity for the trial would just allow individuals to constantly replead their allegations and focus only on the pretrial conduct and be an end run around absolute immunity. And, again, absolute immunity is important not for the prosecutor for his own sake or her own sake, but because ultimately that is what -- that causing -- damage liability will -­ will make prosecutors flinch the performance of their duties more generally.",
  "Justice Sotomayor -­",
  "-- making prosecutors flinch is -- is always a bad thing. What I'm referring to is this Court's precedents that say damages liability on prosecutors is the wrong way to go about it because the costs are too high compared to the benefits, and there are other ways of dealing with that -- from professional discipline, as Malley v. Briggs and Imbler said; to -- to -- to bar actions; to the crucible of the trial process itself, which is a way of dealing with that.",
  "That is precisely correct. We don't think those are constitutionally compelled, but we do think they provide a very important safeguard.",
  "I don't think it's come up with respect to public prosecutors, and so our argument here, to the extent the Court reaches that question -­ and, again, it wasn't -- it wasn't raised below in the brief in opposition, but if the Court wanted to reach that question, I think it would be that the argument would derive the same way as the arguments in this Court's post-Imbler cases, which is, as long as it is intimately associated with the judicial function that the prosecutor is doing, then absolute immunity should extend to that context.",
  "I do think that the government -- I'm not sure if we have any policy with respect to that, but I think that -- that we -- that at least for Fourth Amendment purposes, there wouldn't be a violation if the government held the person for essentially a dual motive, and that is what I understand they have now conceded at page 31 of their brief, which is in dual motive cases, the government's action is permissible. If there are no other questions, I'll reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you. This is a simple case. It's not about Guantanamo, it's not about separation of powers, it's about one simple thing: should we allow damages actions against an Attorney General of the United States and ultimately AUSAs for doing their job, when they're alleged to have a bad motive? If I could start with the Chief Justice's point about the cost of these lawsuits and allowing them to proceed. My friend on the other side says, well, but this will be a small, rare case, an isolated example, but I don't think that's true. I think if you allow their motivation argument to -- to -- to pierce absolute immunity, you will have this in every case or near every case. 95 to 96 percent of Federal cases are resolved by plea agreements. So there isn't someone who is actually called at trial. You could allege it in any of those cases. And particularly when you lace on to that what my friend has said is a disturbing, quote, \"national pattern of abuse\" of the material witness statute, something which we --with which we vigorously disagree, but if you could add the fact that someone wasn't called on in a trial to that national pattern, then you'll be having these damages actions quite a bit of the time. Now he says don't worry, it will only be a few hundred of these lawsuits. Well, leaving apart the fact that that excludes immigration cases and excludes the States' cases, as Justice Kennedy said, a few hundred lawsuits just at the Federal level filed against the Attorney General?",
  "Justice Ginsburg, with respect to that whole set of questions, conditions of confinement, that isn't before the Court right now. What is before the Court is -- is exclusively Fourth Amendment concerns. Now, Mr. Al-Kidd did sue other people, including the warden who was responsible for that, and I think that there have been other ancillary litigation with -- with respect to that, but to hold either the Attorney General or prosecutors liable is something that would, I think, ultimately open the door to, at least there are a few hundred lawsuits at the Federal level if not more.",
  "The officer -­",
  "-- you have -- you potentially have a damages against the officer, not against the prosecutor?",
  "Yes.",
  "Justice Breyer, I'm not sure if your hypothetical has it as the prosecutor who is filing the affidavit and lying or the agent. If it is the agent, I don't think that is something as to which absolute immunity, that's Malley v. Briggs and a whole line of cases. Qualified immunity, of course, would, and indeed those claims are pending in this -­",
  "I think that at least for purposes -- I would say there is at least no absolute immunity prohibition against that. There may be -- may be relevant under other lines of authority. But with respect to my friend's point about your hypothetical in which he said that there -- you know, the government isn't sticking to its position or something like that, I just want to be clear. Our position is for the Fourth Amendment, it doesn't look to subjective motivations at all. That's Whren and Brigham City and the like, but the statute in 3144 does have safeguards, prophylactic safeguards to guard against the type of abuse that I think several justices have mentioned today. So that you could only detain someone so long as their release wouldn't result in a failure of justice and the like. My friend also said that -- that there's no historical precedent for this. I would urge the Court to look at the 1846 statute, which didn't require failure to comply before a witness was brought in on a material witness warrant and it didn't -- and it had sureties in it. I don't think what the government is doing here is any different. Maybe I'll just make one final point, picking up on what Justice Alito said about the allegations in this very case, because I don't think if you look at the complaint that the allegations in this case prove either that the Attorney General or the line AUSA had a single motive. This is fleshed out at pages 17 to 19 of our reply brief. At best, they're consistent with their newly minted standard, a dual motive standard. And given that, I think that the complaint would fall on their own terms, and indeed that law -­ that line that they're proposing, a but-for causation line, would be extremely difficult to apply in practice and would ultimately lead to lawsuits filed against attorneys general and line prosecutors alike. If there are no further questions -­",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the 222 years that this Court has been sitting, it has never heard a case with so many potential perpetrators and so many potential victims, and that quantitative difference with the past is eclipsed only by the qualitative differences presented today. Accordingly, the Court should apply the prudential standing doctrine and hold these lawsuits not fit for judicial resolution. The very name of the alleged nuisance, \"global warming,\" itself tells you much of what you need to know. There are billions of emitters of greenhouse gasses on the planet and billions of potential victims as well.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, I think it goes to both. That is, this Court in outlining what the prudential standing doctrine is all about in, for example, Newdow has said the following at page 11: \"Without prudential standing limitations, the Court would be called upon to decide abstract questions of why public significance, even though other governmental institutions may be more competent to address the questions and even though judicial intervention may be unnecessary to protect individual rights.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, I think that this case is best like Newdow, in which the Court went to prudential standing first before Article III. And the reason for that is because this court in Massachusetts v. EPA, in analyzing the redressability prong of what you're asking said that the reductions that were sought there, if granted, would, quote, \"slow or reduce the problem.\"",
  "Justice Ginsburg, we're not here saying that this case follows inexorably, inexorably from the facts of Newdow or, frankly, from any case that this Court has decided. There is no case in the 222 years that announces the precise rule we're seeking here, and the reason is because you have never heard a case like this before involving the quantity and quality of the claims sought here, the -­",
  "Well, I think that this Court has in Newdow and in Warth v. Seldin used the language of generalized grievances to reflect prudential considerations.",
  "I quite agree with you, Justice Kagan. This is not like a case in which the government is announcing some rule of standing that requires the Court to, for example, call into question previous precedents of this Court that reached the merits or something like that. It's that this Court has never had a case involving this scale and scope, and we think that the prudential standing doctrine, at least in a circumstance like this, which is a Federal common law cause of action in which the Court is already being asked to fashion the rules and, as Justice Scalia says, an equitable action in which the Court has I think special abilities to fashion relief if appropriate and not -- I think prudential standing reflects best the kind of tapestry of different factors.",
  "Right, and I think Aiken says that the prudential standing cases thus far have been about has concrete injury been shown to a particular person. And we're not disputing that for purposes of Article III concrete injury has been shown to at least one plaintiff, but we think that -­",
  "That is absolutely correct, we do disagree to that extent. We think that prudential standing best reflects the Court's general intuition in this area that when a problem is of this magnitude and literally involving the world, where everyone is a potential perpetrator, everyone is a potential victim, and where their own theory at page 15 of their brief and 32 and 40 states: \"If someone contributes one drop to the nuisance, they can be sued.",
  "But I think that the prudential standing doctrine generally and the zone of interest test in particular really do focus on this question, Mr. Chief Justice, about whether or not a case can be cut down to judicially manageable standards.",
  "I'll move to that and take your invitation, Mr. Chief Justice. But before doing so, I would say that if you're going to give me administrative law and zone of interest I think you should then give me Federal common law, which this Court is at its height in terms of fashioning who can come into court and what those rules may be.",

What the Court said is that it would allow regulation in the transportation sector, which would be approximately 1.7 billion tons, and here they are saying 650 million tons.

  "Right. And I'm just talking about the redressability part of the analysis, Justice Scalia. For that the Court said that this reduction in the transportation sector was sufficient. If I could take the Mr. -- the Chief Justice's invitation to address displacement at this time. We believe that we meet the State's own test for displacement, which is found at page 46 of their brief, which is: \"A Federal common law nuisance claim is displaced when a Federal statute or regulatory action addresses the nuisance.\" And here you have not just the Clean Air Act, you have the Clean Air Act plus, a cascade of a number of different actions taken after, Justice Scalia, the opinion in Massachusetts v. EPA.",
  "We think that the Court doesn't really need to get into it. And for the -- the reason is this: Displacement actions are extremely rare, Federal common law actions are rare, so we don't think you should announce some sort of general standard for when displacement occurs. It's a more case-by-case situation. Here you have undoubted evidence that it occurred -- that it has occurred because of a number of different things.",
  "Certainly -­",
  "Certainly, Justice Alito, I think it's appropriate for the Court to look at what has -- what is happening right now. And here's what's happening. First, in December 2009 the EPA issued an endangerment finding, finding these greenhouse gases significant pollutants.",
  "I think that that would present a difficult case, because it would be the one like the Petitioners make, which is the Clean Air Act alone. And I think that what the States themselves acknowledge and what the language of Milwaukee II -­ excuse me -- Milwaukee I says in it is that -- and this is at page 107 of the opinion: \"It may happen that new Federal laws and new Federal regulations may in time preempt the Federal common law of nuisance. We think that both together presents the best and easiest case for displacement,\" and you have that here. You have not just the endangerment finding; you have the EPA regulating all passenger cars, all light motor vehicles right now.",
  "I think that it's a -- it's a difficult case to make for -- for displacement, but I think it could be made, for the reasons Mr. Keisler suggests. But I -­",
  "Absolutely. I think that there's a good argument to be made. I imagine the argument on the other side that you'll hear in a moment is that the Clean Air Act doesn't look precisely like the Clean Water Act in terms of forcing the agency to decide various things.",
  "I think that very well may be. And with respect to that, Mr. Chief Justice, you had asked before about State common law causes of action and whether they would be -- they would kind -- the existence of those would somehow mean that the Court should either find jurisdiction or reach the merits in a way. And we think that the same arguments that prohibit the Court from -- from -- from recognizing a Federal common law cause of action for displacement very well may be preemption questions as well that could be addressed down the road with respect to State common law actions. And we don't think the Court should be troubled by the existence of a potential State common law cause of action. It's just like Milwaukee II, in which the dissenters made precisely this argument. They said: If you don't recognize it, then the States will regulate it and it will balkanize and the like. And what the majority said is: That's a question for down the road; the question for now is has displacement occurred?",
  "I -- I don't think we have a position at this time on that. That's I think an enormously complicated question we can get to at an appropriate time. Our central -- our central submission to you on displacement is this: That there is literally no precedent for the argument that they are making here, which is that the Federal Government has to regulate the precise jot and tittle, the specific relief that they are seeking before displacement occurs.",
  "Well, we think, again, the Court doesn't need to get into that question because it -- you know, the -- there are few Federal common law causes of action in the area of nuisance -- I mean, and there have been two that the Federal Government has filed since 1970 and three that we can find all together in the Federal courts of appeals, all of which have failed for various displacement reasons, and the others. We think none of those look anything like the -- the common law cause of action here. And, so, it would at least require this Court to extend quite dramatically Federal common law to cover this type of situation in which everyone is a potential perpetrator and everyone is a potential victim. And it would require the Court, in fashioning relief, to think through a number of things that the Federal courts haven't ever had to grapple with from the nature -­",
  "That is correct. We think it would still fail prudential standing because of the quantity and quality of the nature of the problem here, and the multitude of different policy judgments that would be required -- that this Court would be required to undertake to adjudicate a Federal common law cause of action in the absence of a statute.",
  "I doubted that there was prudential standing.",
  "I -- I -- I think I put it as we doubt it. I mean, I think that it would require a dramatic extension, Justice Kagan, of a case like Tennessee Copper and the other cases that this Court has heard, which are essentially: A pollutes a river or something and hurts B. A here is the world and B is the world, and that is such a difference in scale and scope to pose enormously difficult questions as to whether this Court should recognize such a cause of action.",
  "Well -- well, there may be arguments, Justice Kennedy -- I'm not sure if the premise of your question has a Clean Air Act in existence or not. There may be some sort of arguments about displacement or preemption under the Clean Air Act -­",
  "Then I think that again for purposes of State common law, I think this Court would approach that question the same way it did in Milwaukee II, which is to say that's a really separate policy-based question that the Court doesn't use to answer the questions about whether a cause of action should be recognized or whether displacement has occurred. But I would point out that the States that have sued generally have doctrines like prudential standing, doctrines like political question, that may very well bar the reaching of these claims in State courts as well.",
  "That's precisely the situation that -- that this Court was grappling with in Milwaukee II, and it said that -­",
  "Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg. Let me say three things about that. First is, EPA is currently regulating existing sources. To the extent that a power plant is modified in any way to increase carbon dioxide above a certain amount -- and this is one of the so-called tailoring rules -- then those power plants right now are subject to regulation. Indeed, one has already had to get a permit. These regulations just went into effect in January 2011 for existing power plants that seek to modify. Second, there is a settlement agreement in place that commits EPA by May of 2012 to deciding how and whether to regulate existing power sources, the existing stationary sources. And third, and I think most fundamentally, there is no precedent, Justice Ginsburg, that says that the government must regulate the specific industry, the specific thing that the plaintiff isolates, in order for displacement to occur. Rather, Sea Clammers and Milwaukee II I think make explicit that that's the wrong question. And so long as the nuisance is being addressed -- and here the nuisance is undoubtedly being addressed with a panoply of different Federal actions in the area of global warming, and an executive order that says that fighting global warming is one of the government's highest priorities -- and concrete steps taken, such as the 500-page tailoring rule, the 400-page -- the -- the other hundreds of pages that EPA has done with its experts to appropriately regulate greenhouse gas emissions, as opposed to a Federal common law court of action doing something which would frankly put you all at sea in terms of the complexity, economics, international nature of the problem.",
  "Well, Justice Kagan, I'm not going to tarry too long on which different way we should win this case. I think either is an appropriate way.",
  "But I think that the prudential standing doctrine is a bit narrower because it -- it contemplates a variety of factors, including the fact that this is a Federal common law cause of action where the Court is fashioning relief in the first place, as opposed to the political question doctrine which looks -- looks more to the standardless nature of the adjudication. We agree that -- that the political question doctrine is an appropriate way to dismiss of this case, but we think that, like Newdow, like Kowalski, this Court can handle this case on prudential standing first and recognize that this is an unprecedented action involving literally the world, and it is not suited for judicial resolution, and that flows quite naturally from the precepts of the prudential standing doctrine.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, we quite agree, and that is why we say that if a statute were -­ were announced to provide standards, that that would provide a way around the political question problem that exists in this case.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: ERISA permits plan fiduciaries to seek appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of the plan. Six years ago, this Court, in Sereboff, concluded that reimbursement actions by ERISA plans, such as the one at issue here, seek equitable liens by agreement. And because the plan's claim here is one for an equitable lien by agreement, that means one parcel of equitable defenses, those derived from unjustment enrichment, offer no help to Respondents.",
  "We certainly are, Justice Sotomayor, bound by equity. Our contention is not that, once you say the magic words \"equitable lien by agreement,\" that somehow transforms into a \"we win\" as plaintiffs at all.",
  "Quite to the contrary, Justice Sotomayor, our position is that the rules of equity bind equitable liens by agreement, just as they bind anything else. We're not trying to say that the equity doesn't apply --",
  "So our position is that the attorney doesn't -- there is no lien created with the attorney; that, once Mr. Sereboff signed -- entered into an agreement with US Air, that agreement said -- provided for 100 percent reimbursement rights. And there is no -- essentially, what happened is Mr. Sereboff -- excuse me -- Mr. -- Mr. McCutchen double-promised his money. He promised it first to -- first to the US Airways plan, and then he promised it to -- to his attorneys. And that's a problem that he might have with his attorneys, although, as I understand the facts here, maybe that debt has been forgiven, but it is not something that creates an independent lien on the money that's at issue here. That is, the rules in equity say that it is the agreement that controls -- when we're talking about an -- when we're talking about an equitable lien by agreement --",
  "Right. So our position is not that Sereboff's letter controls this case. We do think the reasoning of Sereboff essentially does decide the question because what Sereboff said, Justice Ginsburg -- and this is at page 368 of the opinion in the text -- it said -- the Sereboffs had argued the make-whole doctrine. And the -- in response, what this Court said is, quote, \"Mid Atlantic's claim is not considered equitable because it is a subrogation claim. Mid Atlantic's action qualifies as an equitable remedy because it is indistinguishable from an action to enforce an equitable lien established by agreement of the sort epitomized by our decision in Barnes. Mid Atlantic need not characterize its action as a freestanding action for equitable subrogation. Accordingly, the parcel of equitable defenses the Sereboffs claim accompany any such action are beside the point.\" Beside the point. And our position is, once the Court has decided that the type of action that is at issue here is an equitable lien by agreement, the relevant doctrine -- and this is a further answer to you, Justice Sotomayor -- that the Court is to look to is how are equitable liens by agreement evaluated in equity? And those rules in equity say that, again, the general rules of equity apply and govern that; but the one place -- the one set of defenses that aren't governed, are those that sound an unjust enrichment.",
  "That -- that is true, in some subrogation States. However, even with respect to that, when you have -- as long as it's not abrogated by statute or something like that. But if you simply have an agreement by an insured and it provides for 100 percent reimbursement and abrogation of the common fund, even there, Justice Kennedy, the -- the agreement is enforced. So State Farm v. Clinton, which is a case cited in our brief, as long as -- as well as the Dobbs case and other decisions -- the Arkansas Supreme Court in 1969, the Arkansas court in 1931 -- have all said that, if you have an insurance agreement that abrogates the common fund doctrine, that that agreement is enforced. And, here, of course, we're dealing --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, the -- the district court at pages 30A to 32A of the petition appendix had two pages that found the agreement clear and unambiguous with respect to abrogation of the common fund doctrine. And the plan itself is found at Joint Appendix page 20. That finding by the district court was never appealed to the Third Circuit. It was not appealed to this Court. And, indeed, the brief in opposition conceded this issue.",
  "Yes. The summary plan description is at page --",
  "Exactly. And so the plan itself was submitted, I believe, a few days ago. The Respondents have now made an issue of it.",
  "Your Honor, I suppose that -- that they could have made this an issue when they appealed the district court's finding on this. They didn't. And, indeed, there was discovery --",
  "Absolutely not, Justice Scalia.",
  "And much to the -- and much to the contrary, Justice Scalia, exactly, this is the way that they framed the brief in opposition. The question presented is this: \"Whether a seriously injured ERISA beneficiary must reimburse his ERISA plan for 100 percent of his medical expenses simply because the plan language so provides.\"",
  "Two things, Justice Kennedy. First, that brief in opposition goes on to say that that plan was clear with respect to the common fund doctrine and others at page 5. But, second, if you're concerned --",
  "The second point is, even if you are concerned about any discrepancy, point -- 4.2 of the actual plan itself -- and this is page 22 of the PDF that was submitted by -- lodged by my friends on the other side a few days ago -- has essentially an anti-Amara clause in it. It says that the benefits that are provided under the plan are those put forth in the summary plan description. So there is no discrepancy between the SPD in the plan in this case, unlike in Amara where there very well was a discrepancy. So here --",
  "So the plan has, in 4.7, two things. It has, \"The plan\" -- quote, \"The plan shall have the right to recover from any participant the amount of any benefits paid by this plan for expenses which were recovered from or paid by a source, other than this plan.\" And then later, in 4.6, it says, participants are -- quote, \"are obligated to avoid doing anything that would prejudice the plan's right of recovery.\" So I don't think that there is any discrepancy, Justice Sotomayor. And to the extent that this Court were concerned about it, there were 4 years for them to have made this an issue, but this is just about as procedurally barred as -- as anything --",
  "All right. And, Justice Breyer, if you were the district court judge in this case, I suppose you could have reached that result. The district court here --",
  "Well, they -- they had the summary plan description, and they did not make an issue of it. They had all sorts of discovery requests, but never made a request for that --",
  "Justice Breyer, we absolutely agree that a plan could be written in order to embrace --",
  "-- but I think it would be highly unusual for this Court, indeed, I think, procedurally unavailable for this Court to - -",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "So, again, we're not overriding with the principle of equity. We're saying that the rules of equity, if they have in the plan an abrogation of the common fund, as that is here, in the way this case comes to the Court, then that is what settles the question. Now, you could have a Sereboff plan, which says the reverse, which says, we're going to have a common fund doctrine and avoid that problem at the outset. The parties evaluate the valuation of the transfer of assets at the outset, and that's what controls. And if they want to buy into the common fund, as this Court said in Sereboff, that's absolutely enforceable. And so it's not a contract around, Justice Sotomayor, doctrines of equity. It's simply a reflection of the general rule that, in equity, if -- when we're talking about equitable liens by agreement, it is the agreement that controls, that starts the ball game.",
  "Sure. If they had asked for the plan, it could have been provided to them. They have --",
  "I -- I'm not quite sure about that. I will look into that and try and get you an answer on that.",
  "Justice Sotomayor, at the outset, they asked for the summary plan description or the plan. The summary plan description was provided. Only --",
  "Their lawyer.",
  "That's correct.",
  "And -- and I should say, the minute that US Air found out that a tort -- a plaintiff's lawyer was hired, they sent a letter to that lawyer saying, we assert a right of reimbursement.",
  "Yes.",
  "So, Justice Kagan, there are two very distinct rights. Subrogation is the right to stand in someone else's shoes. And so the insured -- the plan says, we are going to inherit all of the benefits and burdens of the insured in bringing an action. It's a vicarious -- it's a kind of vicarious notion. Reimbursement's an entirely different concept. It's the idea that, look, we're not obligated to give you this money because we're not at fault in this accident, but we're going to essentially advance it to you, but you've got to reimburse us for it. And so --",
  "So if it were a subrogation agreement, I think my friend's case on the other side gets a lot stronger because there are subrogation cases that -- that have different rules. But when you talk about reimbursement, which is not the right to stand in someone's shoes, but a first priority absolute agreement between the parties to get money, it's just simply a dispute about that money. And you can't --",
  "There is an argument. And, indeed, all I think you have to do, Justice Kagan, is look at what happened in Sereboff because, in Sereboff, you had essentially the same thing, a plan that had both a reimbursement provision and a subrogation provision. And the -- the beneficiaries in Sereboff were saying, hey, this is subrogation, this is subrogation. And the language that I've read to Justice Ginsburg at page 368, as well as earlier language in the opinion, said, no, this is actually a claim for an equitable lien by agreement that does not sound in subrogation, that sounds in reimbursement. And so all you have to do here is precisely what this Court unanimously did in Sereboff, which is to say, look at the nature of the action, is this an action that seeks personal liability, does it specify a particular fund, the typical hallmarks of an action for an equitable lien by agreement; and, if those are present, as they are here, that is enough.",
  "Not at all, Justice Alito. Two things. One, the rule on ERISA -- and this rule has been the rule in the Third Circuit since Federal Express v. Ryan in 1996, this is a long-established rule -- if an attorney comes and takes a case, knowing that there is a -- an ERISA plan at stake, seems to me they're at least on inquiry notice that there would be some sort of - -",
  "Not so. This is both in our brief, as well as the Blue Cross amicus brief. What usually happens in these situations is that an agreement is struck in advance, before the lawsuit is filed, between the plan and the plaintiff's attorney to reach some accommodation. After all, the plan has an incentive in some sort of action being brought --",
  "Your Honor, I don't think that quite is an accurate statement of the facts. That was precisely what the district court evaluated on the summary judgment motion. They had made a big issue about our failure to communicate and so on. The district court rejected all of those arguments --",
  "I do -- I do think that there were lots -- and this is in Joint Appendix, pages 50 to 64 -- lots of communications between the two. Now, here's -- there was one place where there wasn't communication, which was they went and negotiated a secret settlement of $100,000. And when US Air found out about it --",
  "I am suggesting that we didn't have the opportunity, Justice Sotomayor, that we typically do in the lion's share of cases, as I was saying to Justice Alito, where you work these things out in agreement -- in advance with clear lines of communication. And so --",
  "Because the common fund rule -- and, this, we are in agreement on, the parties -- the common fund rule is a doctrine based in unjust enrichment. This is what they say at page 26. This is what all the courts say common fund is. And, indeed, up until six months ago, seven different circuit courts had evaluated this question of whether the agreement can trump the common fund doctrine. 21 of 21 circuit court judges all said it did.",
  "Yes.",
  "That -- that is precisely right. The agreement sets the evaluation of the parties. That's what the State Farm case says, what their own treatise says, what the Arkansas Supreme Court says.",
  "That -- that is correct.",
  "That is correct. And as the Solicitor General says, at page 17, quoting the Restatement, \"A valid contract defines the obligations of the parties as to matters within its scope, displacing to that extent any inquiry into unjust enrichment.\" Any inquiry. If I could reserve the balance of my time?",
  "Thank you. I'd like to begin where -- where Mr. Wessler left off, with the common fund, and make three quick points. The first is that both equity law and ERISA law point in the same direction. Justice Scalia is absolutely right, that they have zero cases that say, if there's a preexisting agreement that settles the common fund doctrine, that that makes it not enforceable. And Justice Ginsburg's absolutely right to say that when the plan -- the plan is not unjustly enriched, to get the money that they are entitled to get under the contract. The second point I would make is that the Solicitor General says, well, this is now --",
  "I agree.",
  "Justice Sotomayor, that's precisely what cases like State Farm and the Arkansas case from 1969, the Maryland case from 1931, address, which is that situation. And the reason is that essentially here -- it's a mistake to see this as a third-party case. This is really a situation created by Mr. McCutchen double-promising the same money to two entities, US Air and to his lawyers. And so it's essentially a dispute, really, among two parties, not three. Now, the Solicitor General says, well, this is rooted in -- in equitable doctrine. There is no case that they have that says that there's some equitable doctrine that trumps the preexisting agreement. And, indeed, the case that they cite, the Greenough case, is one that essentially relies on unjust enrichment principles. Sure, the Court has an equity power when to remedy unjust enrichment. That is an inherent power of the Court. We're not disagreeing with that. What we are saying is that, when you have an agreement in advance, that means, per se, there is no unjust enrichment, that they are, to use this Court's language in Sereboff, a defense that it is beside the point.",
  "That is precisely --",
  "That is correct.",
  "Congress, in 1974, set it up this way. And I think that that's an important point, Justice Sotomayor. For 38 years, this Court has never embraced an idea that Federal common law allows rewriting of plan terms. It would be a very dangerous doctrine to do so. It'd be standardless. And here is a very vivid example: They are saying that it is inequitable to have the Federal Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan, which governs 4.6 million people, including perhaps members of this Court, which has the exact same provisions as the US Air plan, an abrogation of common fund and a 100 percent reimbursement provision. And they are saying that that would not be enforceable. That may create any number of problems for the government, I imagine, when it tries to enforce that.",
  "Justice Breyer, if the agreement settled that in advance, yes, it would not be unjust. It is the agreement that controls.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin with the question of whether a withdrawn Rule 68 offer could moot a case. It cannot. This Court has said that Article III's case and controversy requirement demands both a plaintiff with a concrete injury and a matter where the Court is fully capable of -- of providing relief.",
  "Absolutely, Your Honor.",
  "We -- We did not waive -- we did not waive the -- we did not waive it. We do think that the brief in opposition should have pointed it out, absolutely. It was a mistake on our part not to -- not to bring to the Court's attention the -- the impact of an unaccepted Rule 68 offer. However, we do think that this Court can -- can consider that, and the reason for that is that it is an answer to the question presented. Indeed, it is literally the question presented. Here is the question presented as -- as my friend Mr. Mann wrote it, whether a court -- \"whether a case becomes moot and, thus, beyond the judicial power of Article III when the lone plaintiff receives an offer from the defendants to satisfy all of the plaintiff's claims.\" And we submit that the answer to that question is no, that the mere receipt of an offer, without more, cannot possibly moot a case.",
  "And --",
  "I -- I completely understand that, Mr. Chief Justice. I guess I would say, however, this Court, in Lebron, confronted a similar situation, in which the matter of whether Amtrak was a State actor, was not present in the cert papers; indeed, it had been disavowed, as Justice Scalia's opinion for the Court said. Nonetheless, the Court considered it and -- and got into the merits of that question. And we think here, actually, it's an easier case for the Court to get into than Lebron. Both --",
  "It does have the unaccepted offer feature in the -- in the question, and of course, this Court's decision in Bray does say that it is the question presented as the Court -- as the Court granted it, that controls.",
  "That's exactly right, Justice Sotomayor.",
  "I don't quite think we conceded even that. That's a separate matter. That's about what the terms of the offer were. And our first point to you is to say this offer wasn't even accepted. Mr. Mann is waxing nostalgic about an offer that literally has not given Ms. Symczyk a dime. She is as injured today as she was the day she filed her complaint.",
  "If -- we think that, just like the Solicitor General, we think that, in that circumstance, it is possible for a court to enter a default judgment and force relief upon the plaintiff. And we think --",
  "I think it could work either way, so long as the forcing happened within the time period of Rule 68. I don't think like -- the court can, like Lazarus, raise this after it has already been withdrawn. The text of Rule 68 says the offer is now dead. If they had, I imagine, moved for the court to enforce that order -- enforce that offer and enter a default judgment within the 14-day period, then I think that would have been something that might have been possible to do.",
  "For two reasons, Your Honor. The first is, of course, that is precisely what didn't happen here. Ms. Symczyk has zero, not even the",
  "And I think it goes back to what then-Justice Rehnquist said in Roper because what he said is it's not then just about the individual plaintiff. You can't force an offer onto a plaintiff that doesn't have all -- it doesn't award complete relief because, if you do so, it undermines the collective action aspect of the claim.",
  "Justice Scalia, we think that the Congress has answered that question, at least in 216(b), by providing for both the opportunity to file a complaint on her own behalf, as well as for those that are similarly situated. And so I think that, as Justice Ginsburg said to my -- to my friend, if you adopt their rule, essentially, you truncate that process and eliminate the ability of people to opt in, in any given situation. And that -- for that reason, it's very much -- assuming that we get to this question, that it is very much like Gerstein or Sosna or Roper in that circumstance --",
  "Exactly.",
  "That -- that's precisely right.",
  "So we think that the corpus of cases that this Court has handled in the class action area, such as Geraghty and Gerstein and the like, we don't think that they absolutely control this question. I don't want to say that. But we think that they set up two principles that help inform the Court's judgment. The first is that, when you have circumstances like this, in which a claim has gone away as moot because the named representative of the claim has gone away for one reason or another, there is play in the joints. Essentially, you can have a bridge plaintiff who acts to keep the case alive for purposes of letting the class unfold. That's really what then-Justice Rehnquist was getting at in his decision in Roper. And we think there is a lot of force to that because, otherwise, as Justice Ginsburg mentioned, the collective action mechanism doesn't even get off the ground.",
  "We absolutely agree with that, and we think that's precisely the problem. And this case illustrates it, Justice Ginsburg, because they -- we filed their complaint, and 75 days later, they filed their preemptive Rule 68 offer. And now, they are coming before the Court and saying something even more radical than I think any court has accepted, to my knowledge, which is even filing a class certification motion along with the complaint wouldn't be enough. That is something that would essentially cut the heart out of the collective action mechanism altogether.",
  "Because the text of Rule -- of 216(b) provides for two different processes, both the filing of the complaint and then a subsequent opt-in process. I suppose we could have done that. That's what the Seventh Circuit has said to do in a case called Damasco, but this Court's decision in Hoffman-LaRoche says the entire collective action mechanism depends on notice and discovery to find out who those people are, to find out and make sure that they are similarly --",
  "Your Honor, that is what we did. You know, we -- we asked the district court, right after the Rule 68 offer expired, within 4 days, to say, please set up a class certification process. And that process was then interrupted by their subsequent motion, after the Rule 68 offer had expired, to say, this case is moot.",
  "That's precisely, Mr. Chief Justice, why we think the Seventh Circuit rule doesn't make much sense. To come in and to ask for certification before you've conducted the discovery and gotten the names, we think is really not the right way to go. Rather, I think this Court's decisions in Iqbal and Twombly suggest that you've got to have some good-faith belief before you go and file a motion for class certification. And I'd be very hesitant for this Court to -- to recommend a rule to litigants that says go and file your motion for class certification right away. This Court, in McLaughlin, I think, essentially said that it's not about the timing of when that motion for certification unfolds. At 500 US page 68, the Court said, \"The fact the class was not certified until after the named plaintiffs' claims had become moot does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction. We recognize in Gerstein that some claims are so transitory\" -- \"inherently transitory that the trial court will not even have enough time to rule on a motion for class certification.\"",
  "Right. I take it this is Mr. Mann's point, that people who aren't yet opted into a class are not parties, and, therefore, the Court can't properly consider them. And I think that's the same exact thing in the class action context, is this question --",
  "Your -- Your Honor, I think nothing turns on their designation as party status or not; rather, the relation-back doctrine, to the extent the Court wants to get into it and deem this offer where we got nothing, somehow, they want to deem it against us, but if it does and wants to get into the relation-back doctrine, I think it would find that it is based on the idea that the cases would otherwise go away, and that you need a bridge plaintiff --",
  "And it's a very important reason --",
  "The reason for that goes back to this Court's decision in Flast -- in Flast, in which it said that, in the kinds of cases we're talking about here, it's not as if we're risking a merits judgment in which relief is going to be imposed against one party and possibly trench on the separation of powers. Rather, the worst that happens, if you rule for us, or if you rule for the plaintiffs in those cases, is that the case goes back down on remand to find out whether or not any of those parties can be identified and come forward. If they do, then you can reach the merits. But this is a very different separation of powers inquiry than the one -- in the case in controversy inquiry than the one that the Court traditionally handles.",
  "It -- for purposes of the statute of limitations, exactly.",
  "Absolutely. And we think, actually --",
  "And -- and, Justice Scalia, we think that that statute of limitations argument cuts the other way. So the statute of limitations provision, which is Section 255, says that, \"in determining when an act is commenced for purposes of the statute,\" and so we don't think it bears on the question or not of whether relation back applies. Much to the contrary, the real worry in the class action context -- and, indeed, my friend's opening line is, \"These cases are going to linger forever, and the defendants are going to have no tool.\" But in the Fair Labor Standards Act context, actually, it's the very reverse because every day counts against the plaintiffs and their counsel. They are incentivized to bring these cases quickly because the clock is literally ticking. And so you don't have, I think, the same worry that you do in the regular class action context of one plaintiff, who can essentially save the day for all of the different -- for all of the different parties.",
  "We think that it is a difference, but we don't think it's enough to change this. And it's for the reasons that then-Justice Rehnquist said in Roper. Here -- here is what he said -- this is at 445 US 341. \"The distinguishing feature here is that the defendant has made an unaccepted offer. The action is moot in the Article III sense, only if this Court adopts a rule an individual seeking to proceed as class representative is required to accept a tender of only his individual claims acceptance need not be mandated under our precedents since the defendant has not been offered all that has been requested in the complaint (i.e., relief for the class), and any other rule would make the questions unreviewable.\" And it's the same point. He is talking there about a retrospective action for damages. The rule that we are seeking here is no different than what then-Justice Rehnquist said in Roper.",
  "I think you should. And this is in response to what Justice Alito had said in the first part of the argument. It is not as if we didn't ask for a hearing. Absolutely, we asked for a fairness hearing at Joint Appendix page 110 in the district court and then, again, at the Third Circuit. And what we asked for specifically was review of the contours of the offer. This is at Joint Appendix page 110. We said, quote -- excuse me, 111 -- \"There has been no review and/or approval by this Court of defendant's offer of judgment to the plaintiff,\" and for that reason, we said, quote, \"Dismissal is inappropriate at this early procedural juncture.\" So this case comes to the Court having asked that particular question about the contours of the offer. We think that an offer that never gave Ms. Symczyk anything is one that didn't make her whole, and for that --",
  "Sure.",
  "I think that the best way to think about it is the -- the category of cases from Geraghty, Gerstein, and Swisher suggest that if the -- if you wanted to hold that offer against us, that you would then say, as Judge Sirica did, the relation-back doctrine looks similar enough to the 216(b) context in this specific area because, otherwise, the 216(b) collective actions won't work the way Congress intended them to work.",
  "I think -- well, it's hard to know how you'd hold that offer against us, in that -- and the way in which you did so, I think, informs that second question. And that's part of the reason why we think it is a predicate question. I suppose that, yes, you could say -- one path available is to say it is a default judgment now that is imposed on us, along the lines of the Second Circuit decision; and, if so, then, as the Solicitor General says, at pages 15 to 18, the then-appropriate course would have been for the district court to evaluate whether other people could opt into the class using the procedures of Hoffman-LaRoche.",
  "Oh, absolutely, Justice Sotomayor.",
  "We were proceeding on the hypothetical.",
  "Exactly. I was proceeding on the hypothetical that -- that, for one reason or another, the Court can't reach that question. And we think Lebron absolutely permits this Court to do so. And we think it's prudent for this Court to reach that question first because you can sidestep and avoid what is, undoubtedly, a very difficult constitutional question about exceptions to Article III mootness and the relation-back doctrine.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State is trying to use Scott Cheever's words to execute him. That's wrong for many reasons, but the simplest one is that, whatever the scope of the Fifth Amendment waiver may be in this case, the prosecution here exceeded it. Scott Cheever's words were uttered in the context of an uncounseled, un­Mirandized, 5­1/2 hour jail exam that the State made him undergo as the price for putting on his voluntary intoxication defense.",
  "Your Honor, we think that that's partially right. That is, our argument ultimately does invalidate a small part of the application of 12.2(d), and for that reason, we think that the Court should avoid that constitutional question by focusing on the scope question, which is a federal Fifth Amendment question, Justice Scalia, not one of Kansas law. And if I could walk you through our 12.2 thinking, 12.2(d) excludes testimony from the defense expert, or it may. It's permissive. And so to the extent that a trial judge ­­ a Federal judge, excluded evidence that the defendant wanted to put on because he didn't ­­ because he didn't submit to the exam or the like, we do think that that application would be violated.",
  "Your Honor, it's the clash between ­­ it's just like Simmons. It's the clash between two different constitutional rights, the right to put on an effective defense on the one hand or the right that is burden ­­ the right of self­incrimination on the other. And it's that choice, Your Honor, which we find makes the compulsion necessary ­­ compulsion ­­",
  "Quite ­­",
  "Quite right.",
  "Quite right, Your Honor. But when a State like Kansas offers the voluntary intoxication defense ­­ makes it part of the State's burden to prove as an element of the offense and then conditions that by saying, well, if you put that evidence on, you then have to pay the price, submit to a 5­1/2 hour, uncounseled, un­Mirandized investigation that goes far beyond what the voluntary intoxication is ­­",
  "No. We ­­ Your Honor, we agree, and we think that this case, obviously ­­",
  "We agree on the legal standard.",
  "And that's what we think you should say, Your Honor.",
  "That's precisely right, Justice Breyer. Both sides are agreeing on the legal standard.",
  "Well, that is ­­ that is, ultimately, what we think ­­ and it avoids the constitutional question by doing that. And this case has never ­­ this Court has never squarely held that the legal proposition that both sides are now in agreement on ­­",

  "Your Honor, I certainly think that's available to you, particularly in the context of this case, in which there is such an interrelationship between the scope issue and the ultimate merits question of the Fifth Amendment.",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, if I could just try ­­ try ­­ if you look at even Kansas's opening brief at page 9, at page 12, at page 40, at page 42, it's all about the scope question. That's their opening brief. And so we think that they are integrally bound up. Be that as it may, it might not ­­",
  "That's quite right. Our broadest position ­­ and we think the one that ­­ that also disposes of this case, is the idea, as Justice Scalia was saying to my colleague on the other side, that what's at issue here is not whether or not the State ­­ whether or not the State can follow where the defense has led, but rather how can they follow. And here, the State is doing something that there is literally ­­ that this Court has never squarely authorized.",
  "I think that's mostly right. I'd like to be a little bit ­­ break down the rule a little bit. 12.2(d) has the provision which says that if you ­­ that the price of not submitting to the exam is the exclusion of the defense expert, so we think that ­­ it's a permissive rule, but if it's applied, we think that's unconstitutional. There are other points of 12.2 which don't raise ­­",
  "I don't think that's what 12.2(c)(4) says. Rather, what 12.2(c)(4) says is that ­­ that the State can introduce expert testimony on an issue regarding mental condition on which the defendant has introduced evidence.",
  "And it's not clear to me whether or not that's talking about a Buchanan situation, one in which the defense has requested the exam or not.",
  "Exactly. And so to the extent, Your Honor, that it's used to ­­ to introduce, as it was in this case, evidence that ­­ that the defendant's own words against him, yes, we think that 12.2 raises a deep constitutional question, something which this Court has never ­­",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Absolutely, Justice Scalia.",
  "Well, we agree with the first 75 percent of that; that is, that, certainly, it's the case that when the defendant takes the stand, they are subject to cross­examination. Cheever took the stand. He is subject to cross­examination. Cheever's expert takes the stand, Evans. He is subject to cross­examination. But the question here is whether or not the State can go further and force someone to submit to a mental health evaluation and use that against them.",
  "No, it ­­",
  "I don't think so. I don't think that's how it plays out. So, for example, if this were an accounting case ­­ a criminal accounting case, and the defendant had talked to ­­ the CEO of the company had talked to an accounting expert, walked them through all the books and so on and said, here's what happened, and so on, and the expert took the stand, I don't think the state could then force their expert to talk to the defendant and have that evidence introduced against the defendant.",
  "Oh, I think that cuts the other way.",
  "And, Justice Scalia, that precisely cuts the other way. This Court, in Couch v. United States, said that's the heart of what the Fifth Amendment is about, the intrusion into a defendant's mind, and here, this case is a perfect illustration of that.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I think what does the work in your ballistics example is precisely that it isn't the defendant's own words; it's something else, and so it's wholly outside of the Fifth Amendment. What we are talking about here in this circumstance is Scott Cheever's own words to the ­­",
  "Yes, but I think the Fifth Amendment imposes a different value judgment of our founders, based on this type of situation in which you are peering into the defendant's mind. I think that's what the language in Couch v. United States is all about, that there is a difference between ­­",
  "Exactly.",
  "We would have a constitutional objection.",
  "Exactly what I was saying to Justice Ginsburg, that this choice ­­ a Simons­like choice was forced upon the defendant. He could either put on his defense ­­",
  "That ­­ that is correct, Your Honor. But, of course, the State can cross­examine our ­­ our psychiatrist and every word ­­",
  "We ­­ we do ultimately disagree, Your Honor, with the bottom­line holding in the Byers case that ­­ that yourself and Justice Scalia was on. We think that that reasoning ­­ the way that the Court got there was to say that there was a policy­based reason under the Fifth Amendment that allowed this. It wasn't waiver, which you've been hearing about. It was a policy­based reason. And frankly, I think that, ultimately, this is a ­­ the governments' argument, both governments, is an argument in search of a theory. We've heard a bunch of different ones. We've heard the Byers one about policy. We've heard Justice Alito's question ­­",
  "But, Justice Ginsburg, we think that Byers ­­ ultimately, the language, the way it got there was purely policy. And we think that this Court has, in the 30 years since Byers, really changed to the game on the use of policy­based reasoning when it comes to the Fifth Amendment.",
  "I don't quite think that's right. The text of the Fifth Amendment is that a defendant can't be \"compelled\" to be a witness. And once a defendant takes the stand and acts as a witness, then it seems to me that is behavior inconsistent, as Berghuis v. Thompson suggests, with the invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege.",
  "When a defendant is forced to undergo a psychological examination as the price for putting on his mental state defense, at least ­­ at least when it's an element of the offense. We don't think you have to get into, as our brief explains, affirmative defenses like the Federal defense ­­",
  "That is correct, Justice Scalia.",
  "It's ­­ it's several cases, but I think Simmons is the best case. Justice Harlan's opinion for seven justices ­­",
  "Oh, disagree entirely.",

  "That's the problem, absolutely.",
  "And that is wholly foreign ­­",

  "No. The Fifth Amendment prohibits ­­",
  "That is not our argument.",
  "The prosecution can still put on an expert witness; they just can't ­­",
  "Your imaginary psychiatrist can't be put on under our system and, indeed, under Kansas's own system, Justice Breyer.",
  "I think it does.",
  "This Court has never once accepted the idea that a ­­ that the government can force someone to talk to your psychiatrist B and introduce his own words against him. That's what the Fifth Amendment is about, and I understand, sure, the government isn't going to have the evidence that it wants. It's going to be the price of the Fifth Amendment. That's what it ­­",
  "If it's ­­ it's simply a rule of evidence that doesn't condition one right against the other, no, I don't think so. It would go back to your earlier question ­­",
  "I think that's right, Justice Breyer. The idea that the government can force someone to undergo a mental ­­ or, excuse me, a physical evaluation and maybe extract stuff from their body as the price for putting on a defense, yeah, I think that raises some Fifth Amendment questions ­­",
  "Well, certainly, I think lack of compulsion is not something that really is being advanced by the government in this case. Even their opening lines of their oral argument are focusing on waiver, not that. And I think it would raise any number of concerns, like the ones you suggested, to go on a compulsion theory, that it would allow introduction of evidence, even if the defendant hasn't led in that direction. But I would like to try and take another shot at persuading your colleagues ­­",
  "I don't quite think that the cross­examination cases go so far as to say that it leads to the same way and gets you so far as to say that if someone testifies by ­­ if an expert testifies using the defendant's own words, that that opens the door to the prosecution doing so. There is something unique about the Fifth Amendment, and the idea that the government can peer into someone's mind and extract information out of them in an uncounseled, un­Mirandized 5­1/2 hour session, and have that used against them at trial. And the price that Cheever paid here was an extraordinary one. He put on a defense that has been a defense for hundreds of years, the idea of voluntary intoxication, and he was told the cost of doing that was that this exam took place and all of this evidence ranging about outlaws and so on was introduced ­­",
  "Well, he certainly testified to ­­",
  "Well, what the defense expert testified to, voluntary incapacitation under methamphetamine, and, certainly, the prosecution expert did that as well, but then the prosecution expert went a lot further to talk about his ­­ it's a suggested anti­social personality disorder, to suggest outlaws, and the outlaws evidence was introduced by the State first in the context of direct.",
  "Right, but I think it does bear on when you think about whether the Simmons analogy makes sense, whether or not forcing a defendant as the price of the defense to open the door to all of this evidence being introduced against him, that is not really a choice at all. That is ultimately ­­",
  "I'm not sure that they would favor it or not. Our argument is simply that, when a state such as Kansas recognizes the voluntary intoxication defense and doesn't have all these witness rules, that Cheever is entitled to put on that effective defense and not have that right to clash against his Fifth Amendment right. And, indeed, the fact that the State has all sorts of options available to it like expert ­­ like expert evidentiary rules or even abolishing the involuntary intoxication defense altogether is the true answer to the policy concerns, not trying to jigger into the Fifth Amendment, somehow some exception that allows for psychiatric exams by criminal defendants.",
  "It may be. It may not be. That's something the legislature would hammer out, but I think that's where the policy objection ­­",
  "We think that, if the Court follows our rule, which suggests that you can't put the defendant to this choice, the State has the option of modifying the voluntary intoxication defense, possibly making it an affirmative defense or putting restrictions on experts, any number of things that may be possible in that circumstance or the legislative process, not through some Fifth Amendment interpretation of this Court, to try and deal with a policy concern.",
  "No, Your Honor, our brief at page 36 points out that, under Kansas law, it's an element of the offense, they bear the burden of proof. In the Sixth Circuit decision in United States v. Davis, I think, explains that in a circumstance like this ­­ like involuntary intoxication, the defendant is not interjecting some new issue into the trial. The defendant is simply rebutting the premeditation argument, which is their burden to prove. And if you accept their argument here, you're essentially saying that the defendant's own words can be used by the State to shoulder the load against him. And that is something foreign to the Fifth Amendment. It may be something you want to do for policy reasons, I understand that, but it is not something this Court has ever accepted. If there are no other questions?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to begin where my friend did not, with the text of the statute. Congress enacted Subsection (A)(ii), like the rest of IGRA, to address gaming solely on Indian lands. In fact, Congress used that phrase \"on Indian lands\" a whopping 24 times in IGRA. By contrast, IGRA says not a word about off­Indian­lands activity.",
  "I do think so, and if I could say first of all ­­",
  "Two reasons, Your Honor, why I think Congress made the choice they did. But, even before that, I don't think that's the proper inquiry for this Court. The proper inquiry for this Court, as C&L and other cases have said, is it requires an unequivocal expression of purpose of Congress before tribal immunity is abrogated, and we don't get into this kind of question of what Congress might have thought, which creates a guessing game. But, just to answer your question, why would Congress have thought that ­­",
  "Well, Your Honor, I know my friend on the other side has said that. That is just flatly wrong. Puyallup, in 1977, Your Honor, precisely said that it involved both on­ and off­reservation activity, it was commercial activity, it was fishing, and this Court said that tribal immunity protected against that. And so ­­ so I do think ­­",
  "It is. At page 167, Your Honor, it says that the injunction was both on and off reservation. And then, in Kiowa, at page 754, this Court made clear that that's how it read ­­",
  "Of course, but I think that Congress, in enacting IGRA in 1988, certainly was under the same set of assumptions as this Court in 19 ­­ in the Kiowa ­­",
  "I ­­ well, I think it's several places in Puyallup, and certainly, that's what this Court in Kiowa said.",
  "And I do think the text is the best guide to what Congress wanted, and the text uses \"on Indian lands\" 24 times. And the reason for that, the reason why there's not an absurdity, is twofold: First, Congress, in IGRA, was reacting to this Court's decision in Cabazon the year earlier, which had ousted State court ­­ State regulatory jurisdiction entirely from on­Indian­lands activity, so it changed the game entirely. Cabazon did nothing with respect to off­Indian­lands activity. It left entirely intact all the remedies we've been talking about, Justice Alito's remedy about criminal sanctions ­­",
  "Well, it certainly could arrest the customers, the employees, and so on. And that's why we would not operate this casino without a square ruling. It is shuttered, Justice Alito, right now, because we need a square ruling that says this is on­Indian­lands activity. And we would like that ­­",
  "We think that that's a consequence of tribal immunity, that when you ­­ when they are seeking relief qua tribe, that's a different thing, and that's, I think, a standard principle ­­",
  "Well, Your Honor, I think, if that sort of circumstance unfolded, we might say let's try and figure out a different way to deal with that. First, of course, the most primary way is the compact itself, and many compacts, for example, have arbitration clauses ­­",
  "Absolutely. We are not here, trying to say that we want to evade the law. We want a ruling ­­ a definitive ruling. We believe, very squarely, that this is on­Indian­lands activity.",
  "Sure. Sure. As part in the district court, as part of ordinary ­­ as part of ordinary litigation, we said that Ex Parte Young wasn't applicable. But we do think ­­ and our brief in opposition says this, our merits brief says this, the United States' brief says this, that Ex Parte Young actions are available against tribes, just as ­­",
  "Well, Your Honor, we would not assert it to the limits of Ex Parte Young. So, for example, Ex Parte Young doesn't ­­ doesn't permit reaching into the State coffers, and here, Count 5 of the complaint tries to reach into the tribe's coffers. So we do think that that type of Ex Parte Young ­­ that is not permitted by Ex Parte Young, and that would be impermissible. If I could return to the second reason why I think what Congress did wasn't ­­ wasn't ­­ you know, creating any sort of anomaly like my friend says, the reason is this: All IGRA did in (A)(ii) is empower compacts. It didn't abrogate immunity by itself directly; it requires the tribe to affirmatively buy into the idea of State law applying on the reservation. So if we could, just imagine a casino, Justice Scalia, opened blatantly on a reservation, a casino without a compact that was absolutely illegal. We will call it \"Casino Red.\" (A)(ii) would not abrogate immunity in that circumstance. The State would have no remedy.",
  "Yeah, on Indian lands, exactly. And so my example of the casino here would be ­­",
  "If there is no compact, Justice Kennedy, there is no abrogation. And so what (A)(ii) does is it empowers the tribe and the compact, and it requires the tribe affirmatively to come in. And that's why, off Indian land, there is standard tribal immunity because the tribe hasn't said anything one way or the other.",
  "Yeah, not at all, Your Honor. All 1166 does is bring Federal ­­ that's about Federal enforcement, not at all about State enforcement. Indeed, Michigan's own position and Michigan's supreme court said 1166 does says nothing with respect to States ­­",
  "Which casino?",
  "No, we do. We think that the proper remedy here, if they had an objection, would have been to arbitrate and say this is not Indian lands. Petition Appendix 77A and 78A lay out the terms of the compact and what gaming is allowed.",
  "Well, two responses to that, Your Honor. First, of course, that is the remedy they agreed to in the compact itself, and, of course, they should try. And second ­­",
  "Well, it is an answer in the sense that, Your Honor, had they asked we ­­ and I can tell you I've discussed this with the tribe ­­ that they would, of course, not ­­ they would, of course, not assert sovereign immunity to enforce the arbitration agreement. We have ­­",
  "Well, we think that that isn't a final decision and is wrong for any number of reasons on the merits that ­­ you know, laid out in the Joint Appendix, and so we do think that would be the argument that we would make to the arbitration board. That should have been the remedy ­­",
  "Well ­­ no, I think that ­­ I think that that isn't, itself, a final decision, and there are any number of mechanisms that may be available to try and get the issue properly teed up to the NIGC.",
  "Well, it would bind, I think, the parties before it, and that's what the parties agreed to. In many compacts ­­",
  "Well, I think that we would still have to persuade the Federal government in one way, shape, or form because of the NIGC's authority in this area, so I think that's two separate questions.",
  "Well, it at least resolves the issue with respect to Michigan. Our central point here is that there's lots of different ways to deal with this question, including the question you asked earlier, the declaratory judgment action, which we brought against Michigan. There's lots of ways to resolve the underlying Indian lands question. The last thing I think this Court needs to do is entirely change the rules of the game with respect to tribal immunity.",
  "Well, certainly, this Court's decision in Puyallup, as well as Oklahoma ­­ Oklahoma Tax Commission, both did deal with injunctive relief, and both were against States, to deal with his argument. Now, he has said ­­ my friend on the other side has said, we'll look to the foreign sovereign immunity context, and that's what's giving him his reason for saying that it wouldn't be such a big change, and we think that's wrong for two reasons. Number one, Kiowa itself, at page 759, dealt with this and said that it was the political branches that led the change on commercial immunity, not this Court. And, number two, my friend has quoted Alfred Dunhill, and I think that everything ­­",
  "Justice Ginsburg, the majority of Kiowa, on page 759, responds to that and says that it was actually the political branches that led with the ­­",
  "And Justice Breyer ­­",
  "Justice Breyer, we would encourage the Court to look at precisely the case he is citing for this proposition, which is Alfred Dunhill, because, as the case was vigorously argued by a Justice Department attorney, and what ­­ and what my friend doesn't tell you is that the pages he is citing actually don't command a majority of the Court. They're about not commercial ­­ they're not about foreign sovereign immunity. They are about active State immunity.",
  "In the California v. Nevada, I think this Court dealt with in Kiowa itself because in Kiowa ­­ because that's about basically the State ­­",
  "Yes, exactly. But I think this Court has recognized in Blatchford and in Kiowa that, in Nevada v. Hall situations, which is what the dissent in Kiowa raised and what my friend is trying to resuscitate, that's a difference in circumstance because there was a mutuality of concession.",
  "We think that ­­",
  "­­ that if they are on Indian lands, yes, there is ­­",
  "When it's on Indian lands, exactly.",
  "Your Honor, I may have misunderstood your earlier question, but, certainly, our position is that you can look to our answer to determine whether or not there is tribal immunity in the case. That is not something my friend has argued. It's outside of the questions presented entirely, which both proceed on the assumption that this is off of Indian lands.",
  "Well, I think that it ­­ I ­­ I don't think it matters either way. Our position is one way or the other.",
  "Right, there would be tribal immunity for that, just as if the blatant casino on Indian lands opened a casino ­­ a tribe opened a casino without a compact, the State would not have an A2 injunctive remedy, and that's why there is no anomaly.",
  "The latter, Your Honor, for two reasons. Number one, that's what the questions presented say; and number two, one of the most venerable precedence of this Court is the ­­ is Justice Holmes' opinion in Kohler Die ­­ which says you don't look to our answer to determine ­­",
  "Well, I suppose ­­",
  "The Federal government has a variety of mechanisms available to it in that circumstance, including closure orders and the like, and I suppose even the State may have any number of actions, both ­­ you know, many States will have this worked out in the compact, but, if they don't have it worked out in the compact, then there may be the possibility of criminal prosecutions.",
  "Right. I think that, still, the State may have any number of criminal or civil remedies available to it. That is, off Indian lands ­­ and this is why there isn't an anomaly in A2 ­­ off Indian lands, the State has vast regulatory power. IGRA was reacting to a circumstance in which this Court ousted State regulatory jurisdiction on Indian lands. And so the State has a whole bunch of mechanisms available to it.",
  "I do think so. I think that that's ­­ I think that that's underlying some of this, absolutely.",
  "Well ­­ well, I certainly would disagree with the idea that you, the Court, should. I think the proper response would be exactly what this Court said in Kiowa, which is, if there's a dispute about the contours of immunity, commercial, off land, State is plaintiff, all of that, those are all things that Congress is well­suited for dealing with.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, that was precisely the argument that was made in Kiowa, was accepted by the dissent in Kiowa. But what the majority said is, really, Congress is best able to balance the rights, remedies, and reliance interests on the parties. And I'd note, picking up on your question to my friend earlier, that, after Kiowa, Congress hasn't been silent. Congress has reaffirmed tribal immunity in the Patriot Act extension in 2005 and the SIGR Act of 2009. They've cut it back in the Arizona Water Act and the Zuni Acts of 2003. This is not a circumstance in which ­­",
  "Well, I think that's ­­",
  "Our position is ­­",
  "Our position, Justice Kennedy, is that they are Indian lands, and there is lots of different remedies available, both on and off Indian lands, and that this Court in Kiowa set out a way to deal with any sort of cutting back, which is to leave it to Congress.",
  "I think what the Court should do is the same thing it did in Kiowa, which is bracket that question because this is as far away from that as you can possibly get. Here, the State entered into a contract with its eyes open that, not just ­­ it didn't say anything about tribal immunity, it reaffirmed tribal immunity, at Petition Appendix Page 90. Now, Michigan doesn't like the terms of that deal, and so they are coming and trying to renegotiate that now, So there may be ­­ for the tort plaintiff, I understand there may be any number of arguments available, but this is so far from that.",
  "They would.",
  "I'm not sure, for an element of that crime, whether that piece of it would be beyond a reasonable doubt. It would be an attendant circumstance and not subject to beyond reasonable doubt.",
  "But there is still civil remedies and other things going.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The facts explain why the bankruptcy court exercised its discretion appropriately under both Section 105(a) and the longstanding inherent power of the court. Mr. Law committed a massive fraud on that court with the fake Lily Lee mortgage and fake documents. Petitioner lied repeatedly to the court, and then lied about his lies, all in an attempt to retain nonexempt property and equity in his home in contravention of the code. Section 105(a) was made for a case like this. It provides ample authority for what the bankruptcy court did, both in its first sentence, which uses a sweeping formulation of any order necessary or appropriate and as well as its second sentence which gives bankruptcy courts, quote, \"the broad authority to take any action that is necessary or appropriate to prevent an abuse of process.\" That is the language Marrama used to describe the second sentence, and it fits here perfectly.",
  "Justice Soto­ ­­",
  "Justice Sotomayor, for precisely the reasons that both Marrama and Justice Souter in the Malley case suggested, which is at the second sentence fortifies ­­",
  "Well, it's at the second sentence fortifies the first; that is, the way to understand the second ­­ the power of the court and the orders that are necessarily appropriate. One such power is to remedy fraud upon the court, the abuse of process. That's what Congress used.",
  "Well, of course, that provision wasn't in effect at the time. That's 522(q) which you are referring to. But we think 522(q) doesn't ­­ isn't violated here. Absolutely, you're right, Justice Sotomayor, if there were a violation of 522(q), 105(a) couldn't take that back. But the language of 522(q), which is found in the blue brief at page 19a of the appendix, just says that if there is a circumstance of a felony ­­ it doesn't even mention fraud ­­ but if there is a felony that occurs and ­­ in the filing of the petition, then it says that ­­ that you can't get more than ­­ you shall not exceed $156,000. It says nothing about the longstanding power of the court to depart downward and to give up to zero. It's just like a punitive damages cap. So Florida's punitive damages law says that if you have ­­ if you're the victim of medical malpractice or something, you can get up to $500,000. You shall ­­ your award shall not exceed $500,000. But of course, that doesn't take back the power of the factfinder to say you shall get nothing in a particular case. And this is a perfect illustration of a case in which a debtor should get nothing. Mr. Law tried to invoke the protections of the code while he repeatedly defied the obligations under the code at every turn.",
  "Our argument here is just limited to this type of case in which you're lying about the underlying asset itself and trying to seek an exemption. I know the Solicitor General advances a broader argument, and I suppose that the Court can deal with that in an appropriate case. But here, Mr. Law undervalued his home and put all of these fake mortgages on, and then repeatedly submitted perjured documents to the court about the very exemption. And as Justices ­­ Justices Ginsburg and Alito said before, what's a Trustee to do in that situation except investigate? That's his duty under Section 704, to try and figure out what has happened.",
  "Well, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that's the wrong way to look at it, with all respect. For one thing, of course, the ­­ the trustee's actions allowed title to be cleared and the underlying house to be sold for $680,000, paying off all the creditors. accepted ­­ and this is something the Bankruptcy Court found at page 77 ­­ the trustee would have had to abandon the property altogether. That's $680,000 that nobody would have gotten. So that's the first thing. And the second thing is, of course, that when the trustee started his investigation and realized there was a fake mortgage, he would have never thought that this would have become, as you said, a half­million­dollar case. He would have thought, well, look, these documents prove this is a fraud. But what Mr. Law did in response was to take 19 separate appeals to ­­ you know, 14 to the bankruptcy appellate court, five to the Ninth Circuit. I mean ­­ you know, I looked at ­­",
  "So two responses. First of all, as to the existence of an alternative sanction, I think this Court in Chambers was very clear in saying that doesn't displace other powers of the court.",
  "Because for ­­",
  "I want to respond to why there isn't an expressed prohibition in a minute. But just taking your point before, the reason is the facts of this case. That is, the sanction would only be paid out of postpetition debt. And I think there's a pretty good reason why my friend's brief on the other side is willing to entertain sanctions and the like, because he would engage in the same type of conduct that he has now, repeatedly stymying the court in the ability to try and get that $75,000 sanction, should it ever be imposed. And so that ­­ so sanctions come from postpetition assets. And that's I think one of the problems. Now, with respect to the bigger question, is there a prohibition somewhere in the code? We don't think there is. We don't think 522(k) says anything like what my friend said in his opening sentence, that this is somehow an express prohibition. We think that the language of 522(k) has to be read against three different things, the first, Section 105(a) and its sweeping language; second, something you never heard a word about in my friend's argument on the other side, which is the longstanding presumption that the protections of the Bankruptcy Code are meant for the honest but unfortunate debtor; and third, language in 522 which Justice Kagan alluded to which suggests that someone is not entitled to the right of an exemption, and the court can take it ­­ the court can refuse to provide it in the first place.",
  "I think you have to read the language of 522(k), which was enacted in 1978, against the fact that Section 105(a) was on the books and indeed enhanced in 1978.",
  "No, because I think in order to understand what the prohibition was, you have to ­­ you have to look to 105(a); that is, what 105(a) does is it says, in general, you have this power. And indeed, 522(k), I think it speaks of the general case in which there isn't this type of excessive bad faith, fraud on the court. And so absolutely, I think in general, just as in Marrama itself, there's general language which says administrative expenses normally aren't liable. But in the atypical case, to use Marrama's words, a case like this in which the only way the code would work and functionally work is to incentivize trustees to try and uncover the fraud.",
  "Your Honor, I think that's what generally both the Hunt prohibition and indeed the first line of Marrama says, which is that the basic idea of the Bankruptcy Code is to provide honest but unfortunate debtors a system of relief. And it misses the forest for the trees to essentially look with tunnel vision just at (k). (K) exists within a larger framework of background duties and obligations that a debtor must comply with. A debtor can't come in and say, oh, I've just met 522. It presupposes they've already met, for example, 5 ­­ Section 521, which is a truthful disclosure of assets and liabilities. And if you adopt Mr. Law's formulation, you're essentially saying that the main architect ­­ the main safeguard against this type of abuse, the trustee, is left holding the bag at the end of the day. The trustee is the only one here who acted, I think, appropriately, trying to uncover all of this, and he would be stuck with hundreds of thousands of dollars in attorneys' fees.",
  "Yes, he can deny him bankruptcy, but that doesn't solve the underlying problem that Mr. Law would still have $75,000 in assets that he is trying to seek under his exemption and the trustee has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to unravel that scheme.",
  "Well, we're not advocating for a limit, but I suppose if one ­­ if the Court wanted to find one, they'd find it in Chambers itself, which said that the inherent power of the court is something that could be exercised sparingly and only in extreme cases. And if ­­ if there is a situation in which ­­ you know, if some sort of forfeiture was a massive amount compared to the underlying fraud on the court, that wouldn't be appropriate. That would be reviewed under abuse of discretion. All we’re suggesting here ­­",
  "Well, but I think that's a problem that ­­ with Chambers itself, Justice Kennedy, and I think the courts have figured out ways to deal with that problem, by saying it's only reserved for the exceptional case and this is really truly that case. This isn’t just fraud on the Court, it's fraud on the Court squared. They're lying about the lies themselves. And the bankruptcy court can't work, it can't function if you don't have the trustee incentivized to under ­­ to undertake the kind of investigation that occurred here. My friend talks about denial of discharge or criminal penalties being ways to try and deal with this, but all of those sanctions depend on the action of the trustee to uncover the fraud in the first place. And when you have someone like Mr. Law, who's a serial liar to the Court, this isn't just bad faith, Justice Kennedy. This isn't just ­­ you know, one document that is wrong by 5 or $10, this is repeated perjury to the Court. And that is the quintessential thing Section 105 is about when it talks about abuse of process. If you don't permit equitable forfeiture here, you are essentially giving effect to Mr. Law's abuse of process. With respect to the underlying ­­",
  "For two reasons, Justice Breyer, because Section 105(a), as well as the inherent power of the Court deal with specifically this type of situation, abuse of process, fraud on the Court itself, not any type of prepetition conduct or anything like that. It's targeted to this. And, of course, the language in 522(q), which we were talking about earlier, is only about that prepetition conduct. It doesn't have ­­ so absolutely. Congress is free, if they want, to abrogate 105(a) or the inherent power of the Court and to say, look, if you've engaged in bad faith, fraud on the Court, whatever, you're still entitled to your exemption. That's not what it says. To the contrary, and this picks up on Justice Kagan's point earlier, 522(l) and (v) provide a mechanism to reject an exemption that is being sought. And here, that happened. 522(l) says ­­ and this is laid out at our brief at pages 38 and 39 ­­ if someone raises an objection to an exemption that a debtor is seeking, that exemption can be denied.",
  "It doesn't ­­",
  "522(l) doesn't say that. It refers to a party in interest, which could be a trustee as well. And so here, we think both the trustee objected in filing the motion for ­­ in 2006 as well as the Court itself. Section 105 has to be read alongside 522, and it provides the Court the sua sponte power to do so. There is a time limit, Justice Ginsburg, in Rule 403, but that time limit can itself be extended if, under the terms of the rule, if there's been a subsequent amendment of the underlying schedule. And here we think effectively, there was a subsequent amendment of the underlying schedule; that is, Mr. Law lied. And I think there's a very strong reason why the time limit shouldn't apply here. Imagine that a debtor took a fake set of exemptions and bribed the trustee to look the other way for 30 days. If that were discovered on day 45, I think it would be thoroughly implausible to think that you could ­­ that the debtor could get the underlying exemption, something that he bribed and lied about just because it didn't meet the 30­day requirement.",
  "I think that ­­",
  "You might be able to go after the trustee as well, but I don't think that the underlying exemption would be given in that circumstance. It's a paradigmatic instance of both the 105(a) power as well as the inherent power of the Court.",
  "Sure. There's been a ­­ there have been a number of cases, the red brief talks about them at page 32 going all the way back, in which the exemptions have been denied altogether for purposes of bad conduct. And we think this case falls within that.",
  "I don't. I don't think anything in the language of 522(l) so restricts it. There are other provisions in the Code which say if an objection has been made, for example, to a creditor under Section 502, that the Court's power to deny that relief is circumscribed in 9 different ways. But there is no restriction on the power of the Court here. And that's why I think Justice Kagan's question gets at this point, which is 522(k) assumes that an exemption has been given, and there's a strong reason under the Code the Court is given the power to deny an exemption in the first place.",
  "I think just the text at 522 itself says so. If there are no other questions.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Federal Circuit applied a de novo without­deference standard to objective baselessness in Section 285 cases. That was wrong for three reasons. First, this Court has already held that a unitary abuse­of­discretion standard should be applied in closely analogous cases in the Pierce and Cooter cases. Those cases, like this one, were ancillary appeals over attorneys' fees concerning the supervision of litigation, which is precisely what Section 285 addresses. Second, the text of the Act, and in particular its key words, \"may\" and \"exceptional cases,\" imbued district courts with discretion. Indeed, up until this case, that was the way the Act applied for 60 years. And, third, the other factors this Court has looked to, such as a lack of law clarifying benefits, the positioning of the decision­maker, efficiency in avoiding distortion, cut in favor of unitary abuse­of­discretion review. For those reasons, the case for such review even stronger here than it was in Pierce and Cooter. In Pierce and Cooter, this Court looked to ­­ for ­­ in Pierce, for example, this Court looked to EAJA and determined that, even though the text of the statute didn't compel a result, nonetheless, unitary abuse of discretion review was the appropriate standard. And here ­­",
  "I think this Court answered that both in Pierce and Cooter. It said if it's a truly pure legal question, then it is a ­­ that it is a ­­ that ­­ that there isn't deference given to that in that circumstance. Now, here the question presented is objective baselessness. And in the context of Section 285 determinations, that kind of retrospective look ­­ was the attorney acting reasonably or not ­­ Pierce and Cooter both say that's something that is always context­dependent. It always depends on the facts.",
  "We would not, Your Honor. So certainly on the merits, if the question of claim construction went up to the Federal Circuit ­­ as it did here, for example, in 2009 ­­ the question there would be there would be no deference under the Federal Circuit's precedent in a ­­ most recently, Friday in the Lighting Ballast case. But when the question is a 285 question, the retrospective look at objective baselessness of which claim construction forms a part ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "As it goes up to the Federal Circuit under existing precedent, they treat that as a legal question. We think this Court's decision in Markman suggests otherwise. It said it was a mixed question, a mongrel question of law and fact. And so when ­­ if the Court were ever to get into that ultimate question on the merits, we think that ­­ that the Markman analysis would control. But here the question is a 285 question.",
  "For ­­ for exactly the reason that I think Pierce says, which is the question in a retrospective attorneys' fees case is not what the ­­ is not what was the law; it's rather, was the position that the party took reasonable. And so, for example, in Pierce the question was under a certain statute, EAJA, do the words \"shall\" and \"authorized\" ­­ do they mean mandatory? And Justice White in dissent said that's a pure legal question. That's something courts of appeals deal with all the time, district courts don't deal with it; we should give no deference to that. And Justice Scalia's opinion for the Court said, No, even there, that is something we're looking at that legal claim as situated within the particular contours of the case overall in deciding was that a reasonable argument or not.",
  "We agree that's one of the things the judge is doing there, but it's not the only thing. Just as in Pierce, certainly the Court was interpreting the meaning of the statute, but they were doing it within the context of litigation. This case I think is a helpful example and ­­ to remove it from the abstract and just bring it down to here. You've heard and you've read the brief on the other side saying this is a claim construction dispute. It's not a claim construction dispute. What the district court found seven different times when it imposed fees is that this is actually a dispute about infringement and their inability to come up with any theory whatsoever for why ­­ why there was a infringement violation. And what I think the logic of Pierce and Cooter is, is that if you give clever appellate lawyers like my friend the ability to go to the ­­ to go to a court of appeals and repackage what were essentially factual claims and claim they're legal ­­ here, claim construction ­­ then you're going to ­­ you're going to waste an enormous time of ­­ time and resources of the Federal Circuit as they seek to disaggregate, is this really, truly factual or is this really legal. And you wouldn't want to have that, I think, for the reasons that this Court has said repeatedly, which is the whole goal in attorney fees cases is to avoid a second major litigation. And that's precisely what the Federal Circuit did here. It minted a whole new theory under this de novo without­deference standard. And that's the harm. That's the evil that I think all of the attorney fees cases are trying to address. I'd also say that, you know, even if ­­ beyond Pierce, beyond Pierce, we do think this is essentially Pierce­plus; that this is a case in which the text of the statute and its key words, \"may in exceptional cases,\" give the Court, I think, further reason to return the standard to the way it has always been interpreted for 60 years. And for 60 years: From 1946 to 1952, Abuse of discretion deferential review was used in objective baselessness cases; in 1952, the ­­ the Congress codified, essentially, those ­­ that interpretation; from 1952 to 1982, the regional circuits used it, like the D.C. Circuit in the Oetiker case; after 1982, the Federal Circuit used it time and again in cases such as Eon­Net. It's this case that really is a dramatic departure from the way Section 285 has been interpreted, and indeed the way all attorney fee litigation has been interpreted.",
  "We think that it is hard in that circumstance, and that's the one­way ratchet. We don't place a lot of emphasis on that in our brief. It's our last argument. But we do think, essentially, it is hard to overturn a district court's decision not to award fees, whereas under the Federal Circuit's interpretation, it's really quite easy for the Federal Circuit to mint some new theory as to why the position was reasonable that ­­ that the attorney took. And, Justice Breyer, you said in the last argument, you said clever patent attorneys can always come up with a colorable argument, and you were referring at the district court stage ­­",
  "We do think implicit in an abuse of discretion standard or Congress committing this to district court discretion will be some variation. We think this Court answered that problem in Koon, I think most particularly, in a case where the stakes were ­­ you know, not to belittle this case ­­ but the stakes were even higher there, criminal sentencing. And what the Court said is, yes, there will be some disuniformity, but district court judges are better able to determine the mine­run case than will the court of appeals because they're able to assess the entirety of the litigation, rather than ­­ than one piece of it.",
  "Well, it would certainly depend on how ­­ on how you did it, but our brief at pages 34 to 37 say that if you adopt any variant of the petitioner's theory in Octane, the case here only gets stronger. You have to, I think, ultimately reverse what the Federal Circuit said at page 9a of the petition appendix, which is objective baselessness must be determined de novo. We think that that's wrong for all the reasons we've been talking about. And even were you to change the standard in Octane, so long as objective baselessness formed any part of the Section 285 inquiry ­­",
  "We think it never becomes a pure question of law. There ­­ there are ­­ we don't doubt that ­­ to answer the Chief Justice's question from before ­­ we don't doubt that there are some circumstances in which there are pure questions of law in Section 285 cases. For example, what does the Patent Act ­­ the Patent Clause in the Constitution mean, or what does a particular statute mean? But when you're dealing with, for example, claim construction, that looks very much like the EAJA question that the Court was dealing with in Justice Scalia's opinion in Pierce. It's a retrospective collateral question about how reasonable was this argument at this particular time, in this particular case, with these particular parties, with this particular patent. And what Justice Scalia's opinion in Pierce says is that's not the type of question that we should be spending a lot of court of appeals' resources on. That's something that is dealt with on the merits, as it was here. The Federal Circuit dealt with the question on the merits in 2009 ­­ but not something that you should have a second major litigation over. If there are no further questions.",
  "Thank you. I ­­ I'd like to pick up on Justice Sotomayor's question about the facts of this case, because I think what you heard from Mr. Dunner illuminates our position on why the Federal Circuit's de novo standard is so problematic. We warned, of course, that the de novo standard would become a magnet for litigation and encourage 285 losers to roll the dice, hoping that they can repackage a factual dispute as a legal one in the court of appeals. And Pierce and Cooter warn against that and say that's a waste of resources as, Justice Breyer, you're picking up on. And, Justice Sotomayor, they say, you've already had a merits determination, as their one here. This case proves that. You heard Mr. Dunner say, quote, There were no factual issues in this case, and he talks about the Trigon ruling from the Eastern District of Virginia. As the district court here found, Petition Appendix 63A, Trigon was irrelevant because the question was infringement, not claim construction. And that was why sanctions were imposed. And if there's any doubt, here's what Allcare's own lawyer told the Federal Circuit in 2009. These are his opening words, quote: Summary judgment was granted at the district court in this case for two reasons. First, it was held there was a lack of evidence from which a reasonable finder of fact could determine the step of 52(c); and secondly, the district court held even if there was evidence that step 52(c) was performed, there was insufficient evidence of direction or control. Question from the Court: This really seems like it's a claim construction issue for us as to the meaning of this claim. Answer from Allcare's lawyer: I would disagree that claim construction ought to be revisited at this level. In 1999, this court expressly stated it was inappropriate to sua sponte revisit it. Now, I'm sorry to belabor the facts here, but I think they illustrate the wisdom of Justice Scalia's opinion in Pierce, as followed by Cooter and Koon, which is clever lawyers can always make arguments on appeal, make them look ­­ make them look legal when they were factual. This case is example A of that. Now, my friend on the other side has said that ­­ that there wasn't history from 1946 to 1952. We encourage the Court to look to the ­­ to the cases cited at pages 11 to 13 of our brief, and in particular to look at Orrison v. Hoffberger, a Fourth Circuit case, which says that in evaluating whether there's, quote, no reasonable ground for the prosecution of a motion, the court says it, quote, cannot be said there was abuse of discretion. In many of these cases, they refer to the Abuse of discretion standard. And, of course, Mr. Dunner is right, that if it's a pure issue of law, that is something as to which there isn't deference. But when the question looks, as it does here, as it does in 285 cases about objective baselessness, whether a litigating position was reasonable after the fact in collateral attorney fee litigation, this Court has always said in all of these cases that abuse­of­discretion deferential review is appropriate. Now, Justice Alito, you had referred to the size of the award here, and to be sure, it is different than Pierce. It's not different, of course, than Cooter because in Cooter we're talking about Rule 11 sanctions which can devastate an attorney's livelihood. And nonetheless, the Court in Cooter said they would apply ­­ apply deferential abuse of discretion review there. I think the best answer to that is Koon itself. In Koon, the stakes were really high, jail time, and what the Court said is defer to the district court because the district court has the best perspective, the kind of bird's eye view, a front seat on litigation. And that's why this case is different, than for example, Scott v. Harris or, Justice Alito, the qualified immunity cases. Because in both of those, those questions involved things as to which the district court doesn't have a courtside or ringside, whatever term we want to use, seat. They are not present. They are not there at the scene of the crime. They are not there when law enforcement is conducting whatever operation or something like that. Scott v. Harris, same thing, it's not a qualified immunity case; it's a summary judgment case. And the words, as our brief points out at page 24, say, If there is no factual dispute, then you evaluate it on the law. We ­­ we agree with that. The question is here, where there are factual disputes, as there are in all objective baselessness cases, what is the appropriate standard. This Court's answered it several times in Pierce, Cooter, and Koon, unitary abuse of discretion review. If there are no further questions.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A man is being put to death under jury instructions that are so confusing that there is a reasonable likelihood that some juries would interpret those instructions to bar consideration of the mitigating evidence and others would not. That ambiguity and inequity is impermissible under the Eighth Amendment. Now, the State's answer is the instructions allowed the jury in a catch­all provision to consider everything as mitigating. That's irrelevant. There are two fundamentally different questions. The first is the \"what.\" What kinds of circumstances count as mitigating? And second is the \"how.\" How does a jury determine if those circumstances exist in a given case. So ­­",
  "Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice. We agree that, for example, the jury was instructed that Reginald Carr's child abuse, if it existed, could be a mitigating factor. The question is: How was a jury to determine whether Reginald Carr was abused in the first place as a child? So the catch­all provision doesn't answer that question. Now, General Schmidt's answer is, well, look at the language of instruction 2. And, Mr. Chief Justice, I think you were referring to that. This is what they say ­­ what he says in their reply brief at page ­­",
  "Okay.",
  "In 7 ­­ in 7 ­­ in 7, I don't see quite the same thing. But ­­ but I ­­ I think our ­­ out general point here is that this Court has said repeatedly in Abdul­Kabir and in Braverman that the mere presentation of evidence is enough. The evidence has to be given full effect as a mitigating circumstance. And I understand that different people can look at this ­­ these set of instructions as a whole and come up with different ways of interpreting them. But this Court's decision in Boyde says as long as there is a reasonable likelihood that a jury could read them in a confusing way and bar the consideration of mitigating evidence, that is enough. Now, Justice Scalia, you said, well, that doesn't square with common sense. What about an example like, quote, \"interest­free loans for people with good credit\"? Now, our argument is not simply that the jury instruction said beyond a reasonable doubt, though they did 9 times. It's that they coupled the beyond a reasonable doubt with the language found to exist, that mitigating circumstances must be found to exist 9 times. And so, Justice Scalia ­­",
  "I was just going to say, that is not death for the worst offender, Mr. ­­ Justice Alito, that's ­­ that's ­­ that's the death penalty to be imposed for the worst interpretation of jury instructions.",
  "Well, Justice Alito, I think this Court has never said that if jury instructions are, by silence, confusing, that that silence alone is enough to rise to an Eighth Amendment violation. Here, our point is that the instructions themselves injected the confusion. And so I don't think this Court is going to police every possible thing that the jury might thought in their heads. The point is here they mentioned only one standard, beyond a reasonable doubt. They mentioned it 9 times. And they said that the mitigating circumstances had to be found to exist. If the jury interpreted it this way, then this Court ­­ then the Court would be blessing a jury instruction on beyond a reasonable doubt for the first time ever in its history that said that a jury, all 12 of them, might have believed mitigating circumstances actually existed and could not give it effect. That is what the effect of ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "And Mr. Chief Justice, they were clearly instructed that mercy was a, quote, \"a mitigating factor.\" And so they were then told 9 times that they had to find a mitigating factor.",
  "Absolutely, Your Honor. I think this Court has said many times that we presume a jury follows its instructions, and this is a perfect example of that ­­",
  "I don't ­­ I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice. I think this is a perfect example of how mercy would have been applied beyond a reasonable doubt. If there was case for mercy after reading all of the ­­ all the sentencing proceedings, it was that Reginald Carr had been abused badly as a child. And that's why mercy should have extended. We are ­­ we're talking about death­qualified jurors here who already can't extend mercy just simply because death is on the line. There had to be something additional. That something additional, in the context of this case, was all about the child abuse of Reginald Carr. And, Justice Kagan, that's exactly what the State, time and again, Joint Appendix pages 250 to 256, said that ­­ that Reginald Carr did not meet his burden of proof on. And so this was front and center at the mitigating phase of the trial. This was extremely confusing, I think, to a jury. And, of course, this Court's decision in Boyde has a far lower standard than that. It's simply just was there something more than a possibility, it doesn't even have to be 50 percent, that the jury interpreted the instructions the wrong way.",
  "Exactly. And just like in Maryland v. Mills where this Court, under the Eighth Amendment, looked to that, here it's significant that not even Kansas is defending the rule that these jury instructions left the jury with the impression of. I mean, indeed, I'm not aware of a single State that does so. There's no amici on the State's side saying that this is going to impose any sort of harm to them. This is the most modest fix in the world. It could be done not just with an affirmative instruction, it could be done by just striking out the words \"found to exist\" out of the jury instructions.",
  "Oh, no.",
  "I don't think so at all, Your Honor. I think found to exist, that's the most natural way of reading it. And if there's any doubt, just look at Instruction No. 1. The first thing the jury was told ­­ this is at Petition Appendix page 500 of the Reginald Carr petition. \"The laws of Kansas provide a separate sentencing proceeding shall be conducted when a defendant has been found guilty of capital murder.\" That's what they're told after hearing months of testimony about whether or not the Carrs committed the crime under what standard? The beyond­a­reasonable­doubt standard. That was the only thing the jury was told, time and again, both at the guilt phases, the 9 times in the mitigating phase of this trial. It thinks ­­ it's absolutely reasonable for a jury to have interpreted the jury instructions to say that's the standard that applies here. And boy, if that's the standard that applied in this case, that is unlike any proceeding in Anglo­American jurisprudence to my knowledge.",
  "Well, I think it means that ­­ that ­­",
  "I think that ­­ in Kansas, I think that's right. Now, of course you could have minimum thresholds, evidence, and relevance, and so on, as this Court's decision in Tennard said. This is the opposite. This is the highest standard in all of law, beyond a reasonable doubt. It's never been done. And these jury instructions did so. And look, I understand that we could read these facts and say these are horrific crimes, as you said, Justice Alito. But so, too, Reginald Carr had a horrific upbringing. And I think the jury was entitled, and this Court's decision in Stringer says, that it is ­­ when ­­ when the injection of an arbitrary factor is put in and two juries could reach different results on the same facts, that violates the Eighth Amendment.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Three things are undisputed. First, that Montanile signed a form saying, quote, \"I agree to reimburse in full the Plan from any settlement.\" Second, the Plan provides that such funds are, quote, \"Assets of the Plan not distributable to any person without the Plan's written release.\" And third, under Sereboff, that the Plan would have an enforcement claim under 502(a)(3) if Montanile still possessed the funds. What we're disagreeing about is whether Montanile's decision to commit a second wrong of spending the Plan's money himself has made him judgment­proof. And the answer is no for a very simple reason: When a right under equity has attached and a defendant then knowingly frustrates that equitable claim, it is absolutely part of equity to permit that claim. This reflects the cold reality that the defendant took actions that blocked an otherwise valid claim in equity.",
  "So it ­­ it's ­­ Barnes says that the ­­ that the lien attaches at the moment that he is ­­ that he has gotten title to the thing. He gets title to the thing when there is a $500,000 settlement. Settlement, of course, that we didn't know about, but that he nonetheless did. Our only ­­",
  "To a ­­ to a lien of $121,000 on it. And so our claim is not that we have some general remedy at law that we can get compensatory consequential damages or punitive damages. It's limited by the lien itself. And that is the rule in equity, that when someone frustrates a valid claim in equity by taking actions to dissipate the fund, you can get ­­ recover the value of that fund. You can't recover more than that. So this is the bitter with the sweet that when ­­ when you make an equitable claim like this, you have to be limited by all the rules of equity. So in addition to that, Justice Sotomayor, we couldn't, for example, try and attach the asset, try and attach and file a lawsuit, until he actually took possession of the funds.",
  "So ­­ so first of all, we're not advancing that theory, Justice Breyer. You cannot get ­­ we're not advancing a damages theory whatsoever. All we're saying is that you can recover the value of the lien itself when someone frustrates an equitable claim that otherwise exists. And we point to three different traditions in equity that permit you to do that: substitutionary monetary decrees, deficiency judgments, and swollen assets. All of those reflect the basic idea that someone shouldn't profit from their second wrong, their wrongdoing of dissipating a fund. So look, there is a ­­ they're absolutely right. The general rule is that you can't recover from general assets. That is absolutely right. But there's an urban legend that ­­ that I think the briefs try and spin around that rule, to say that that general rule encompasses a situation when someone acts wrongfully to dissipate a fund, as to which someone has a claim. And that circumstance, Justice Holmes's opinion in Otis says, he says, if the complaint, quote, \"seeks the recovery of an identified fund, that complaint will not fail because the fund is gone and misappropriated by the defendants. Rather, under those circumstances, the plaintiff has a right to compensation as alternative relief.\" That's not damages ­­",
  "No, it's not, Justice Scalia. I think it's not, for several reasons. Number one is, of course, in that case, the entire fund was gone. So if it were cleanup jurisdiction, there had to be something to pend to. There had some ancillary jurisdiction, some equitable claim. There had to be some fund that was still remaining in order for there to be something to pend to. There wasn't there. The entire fund was gone.",
  "Well, I think that otherwise ­­",
  "Otherwise, Your Honor, there wouldn't have been any reason ­­ there is a requirement that, in order for ­­",
  "I don't think that there's ­­",
  "No, your Honor. If ­­ if their argument is right, and this is something that Judge Posner has said, for example, in ­­ in describing this in the Medtronic case. In order for ancillary jurisdiction to exist, there has to first be a valid equitable claim. And then, for the convenience of the parties, you can resolve a legal claim. In Otis there was no equitable claim under their theory, which ­­ which is, you ­­ you know, if the fund is gone, there's no lien that it's attached. It's gone. It's dissipated. So ­­ and then it also say, you know, it's a remarkable that they say that all of these cases are cleanup jurisdiction.",
  "Because we think that the proposition that they're trying to say is wrong, the idea that when you dissipate a fund, you lose your equitable claim. Our point is that is ­­ that's generally true; not true in a circumstance when a defendant frustrates an otherwise valid equitable claim.",
  "Well, you can't do that, of course.",
  "You can't do that, of course, as Knudson says. And ­­ and that's a standard rule. We're not here ­­",
  "Correct, Your Honor. As long as that was a knowing dissipation, that that's what happened. And that's what the substitutionary momentary cases ­­",
  "Sure. Otis itself is a case that does that. Justice Homes's opinion, Justice Story has a description of other cases in his treatise. Our ­­ our brief talks about the Baxter case and the ­­ and the Bank of Marin case. These are the closest analogue to this case, because they're not the general rule about can you recover from general assets; they're about the specific rule, can you profit from your wrongdoing when an equitable lien by attachments is ­­ or an equitable lien by agreement is already attached.",
  "So ­­ so three things, Your Honor. First, we're not grounding our argument in the policy of things. We do think that the policy consequences are ­­ are important, but we think that if the test is what's traditionally available in equity, these three specific lines of authority that we're pointing to answer that question. But as to the policy concerns, we think exactly as you said to my friend on the other side. There are two big problems with that. Number one is Plans don't get noticed about when settlements occur. In the amicus brief from NASP explains most auto accidents, for example, are settled without any public record, without any lawsuit being filed whatsoever. So you can't exactly type it into Westlaw or something like that. So that's one problem. The other is that it becomes very expensive for Plans to monitor this stuff. And Plans are, you know, some for profit entity. Every dollar that you spend that the Plan has to spend on monitoring or writing these letters or filing lawsuits or filing TROs is a dollar that is taken away from innocent Plan beneficiaries, people who have done ­­",
  "Right. I'm certainly not trying to do that. All I'm saying is that the policy arguments here, I do think, are substantial and have weight. The amicus briefs, before you say, over a billion dollars each year is recovered through these reimbursement actions. And ­­ and if you adopt their plan, then as you were saying as to my friend, you're going to just tell the client ­­ you are ­­ telling the Montaniles of the world, spend that money right away. Settle the case at 10:00, and by 10:01 spend all the money. And in that circumstance, then Plans are out of luck. Innocent beneficiaries, that means, are out of luck, and people like Mr. Montanile get a double recovery. And equity is not so brittle. There is no tradition in equity that supports this idea. As, Justice Alito, you were saying, how could this make any sense? It didn't make sense at equity. Equity has always been more flexible than that. It's always recognized the idea that people shouldn't be able to profit from their wrongdoing, and that rights have remedies, and avoiding formalistic distinctions. And speaking of formalistic distinctions, the Solicitor General's rule is as formalistic as it gets because they say you can get the remedy out of general assets as long as the lawsuit is filed in time for ­­ the lawsuit is filed ­­ is filed at a time when there was possession of the fund. That is ­­",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, as Justice Frankfurter says, equity, quote, \"assures mechanical rules and depends on flexibility.\" Every equity treatise ­­ look at Pomeroy, for example, of Section 111. All the other treatises say ­­",
  "I think very much ­­",
  "­­ very much it does. There is not a quote from Pomeroy or from any of the other treatises that deal with this situation when someone is trying to profit from their second wrong, when there is already an equitable lien by attaches. And, you know, for example, Pomeroy, just on the flexibility interchange, were saying, Section 111, \"Equity has followed the true principle of contriving its remedy so they shall correspond both to the primary right of the injured party and to the wrong by which that right has been violated. It has therefore never placed any limits on the remedies it can grant either with respect to their substance, their form or their extent, but it's always preserved the elements of flexibility and expansiveness so that they can be modified to meet the requirements of every case.\" And this is a perfect example ­­",
  "Well, they are technical when it comes to that first question, is there an equitable claim in the first ­­ first instance. And so Knudson, for example, says no, because there's no possession of the fund. Sereboff says here there is possession; therefore, there is. We don't quibble with any of that. Here as this case comes to the Court, everyone agrees ­­ that's the third point I made at the outset ­­ everyone agrees there was an equitable lien by agreement. The only thing we're disagreeing about is whether or not by spending all the funds we've lost our remedy. And with respect to that question, they have general precedents which say you can't go after general assets. We agree with that. The relevant question is, when someone has wrong ­­ when ­­ when ­­ when a valid equitable lien by agreement attaches and then someone acts to dissipate that, can they profit from their wrong.",
  "Right.",
  "Right. Justice ­­",
  "Justice Sotomayor, this is, again, part of the urban legend that ­­ that's being developed around this. There is no case that says that a substitutionary monetary decree is a legal judgment or is ancillary. To the contrary, cases that we're citing such as Baxter and Otis suggest that it is an equity not in that. And ­­ and indeed, if there's any doubt about this, I ­­ I suggest that you'd have to say it's equity, because the tradition for ancillary, which was pendent jurisdiction was, if an equity court was going to decide a legal claim, they had to label it as a legal claim because of the Seventh Amendment reasons, because otherwise, they might, you know, there's ­­ there's all sorts of jury trial issues that come up. So that's why the tradition for cleanup jurisdiction was to label those claims specifically to say, okay, first we're going to solve our ­­ our equitable claim, and now we're going to turn as part of our pendent jurisdiction ­­",
  "So with ­­ with respect to the ­­ the lawyer piece is much more complicated. And this goes to Justice Breyer's question. I mean, there's actually a circuit split on this question about can you go after the lawyer, and the reason why you may not be able to go after the lawyer is the lawyer is not a party to the underlying agreement. And that's what I think the Eighth Circuit says in contradistinction to others. And so that's ­­ that ­­ that it is ­­ that is not a great remedy. And, of course, it requires the lawyer to be on notice of the Plan and all the reimbursement obligations and the like. Under equity, Justice Sotomayor, I think the idea is that when someone has made a valid promise to ­­ for these funds, such as here, Montanile knew that he was playing with house money. He knew that these weren't his ­­ this wasn't his money; it was the Plan's money from the start. And then he goes and spends that money on other things. Yes, you can go after his general assets to recover that spending on other things. And that is something amply supported by these three different traditions in the case law. Those are the closest analogs to what's going on here when someone has dissipated and frustrated a ­­ an action that ­­ that otherwise existed.",
  "Well, I don't think that the answers are clear on that, but I do think it's when he takes ­­ I think the most this Court has said it's when he takes title to the thing. And presumably, he takes title to the thing at the moment that the check is given to the lawyers. Now if, at that moment, Justice Ginsburg, say the bank account of the lawyer was hacked and the $500,000 settlement was gone, our view is his general rule then kicks in. In that circumstance, we cannot recover. The only thing we're saying is that when a defendant knowingly dissipates a fund as to which someone else has a claim, it's in that circumstance that the exception ­­ as Justice Story called it, that peculiar exception applies to try and basically make sure that he isn't profiting a second time from his wrongdoing. That's why the claim is a very limited one at equity. It's just a ­­ it's a ­­ and again, it's only limited to the amount of the lien. You can't go more than that. You can't have punitive damages and the like, and it's encumbered by all the defenses in the equity. We have to take the bitter with the sweet, so laches and unconscionability. All of that would be standard defenses that are available to such an action. Now, my friend on the other side has said, well, this is going to reach disability situations. Absolutely not. I mean, I think you have a variety of amicus briefs before you that say that there's a specific statute, 407(a), which prohibits liens against Social ­­ Social Security Disability overpayments. He says it's going to reach pension overpayments. Again, that's not our rule. Our rule in ­­ in those ­­ in those circumstances, a pension plan is overpaying a beneficiary. And if the beneficiary spends that, well, that's not something that they're knowingly dissipating. That's very different than a circumstance like this in which someone is dissipating a fund as to which they ­­ someone ­­ as to which the Plan has an underlying lien against. And that's why it's a ­­ it's a very limited rule. It's one that tracks the tradition at common law. Both Otis talks about misappropriation, and Baxter talks about wrongful dissipation when someone has a valid lien against you. And as well, the Orr case, for the swollen assets theory and the like. Now, my friend on the other side says in his brief, well, then why in the world are we spending so much time ­­ are all these equity cases spending so much time on tracing? And our view is very simple on that. Tracing makes a lot of sense. In the lion's share of cases, tracing becomes very important because you don't have a defendant who is acting wrongfully and knowingly dissipating a fund. And so the Plan or whoever the trustee is wants to ­­ wants to go after general assets but then can't, unless they can trace them to a specific asset. Tracing is just a lien­priority doctrine. It's nothing more than that. The Restatement that my friend cites on the other side that is cited in Knudson in Section 215 is as clear as day. It just talks about lien priority. It doesn't say that there is no claim if general ­­ if ­­ if someone dissipates a fund. It says that they are not entitled to lien priority. That is it. And look, we agree with that. We're not here trying to say we have a priority over other asset ­­ over other creditors. We're just simply saying we are to use the language of the Restatement, a \"general creditor.\"",
  "Well, we are then ­­ you know, as long as we can't trace it in a world of no tracing. So there's obviously some funds here that we may able to trace, because as the interchange with Justice Ginsburg was suggesting, it's not totally clear what was spent and what isn't. But with respect to the rest, yes. I mean, we have to take the bitter with the sweet, and that means we are a general creditor out of general assets. It's not like we get first priority over those assets, which is why this remedy is at best a second­best one for us. I mean, the ideal is, of course, to prevent someone from dissipating the funds altogether. And we do think, if this Court recognized, as I think most of the circuits have, that we have a cause of action here, then I think it would deter people from engaging in the kind of behavior that Mr. Montanile did.",
  "So if ­­",
  "Well, it is in the situation of a dissipated fund. So obviously, if we can trace ­­ and this is why tracing is still important.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy ­­",
  "I would if ­­ it sounds like we could trace that fund. That is, the fund hasn't been spent in that circumstance.",
  "Right. So then ­­ and that ­­ that's exactly right. So we would have priority over that $500,000, in that circumstance, over other creditors. My only point is if we're in the Montanile­like situation in which he has ­­ let's say he spent down that entire fund and there's another creditor who also ­­ Montanile owes money to. Once that happens, we are ­­ we can only recover just like the other general creditor. And that's what the Restatement says. That's all it says. It does not say that if a fund is dissipated, that there is no claim anymore. That would be contrary to the whole idea as Justice Alito's question was, about what equity is all about. That makes ­­ that makes no sense. An equity is not that brittle, Justice Scalia. I understand that there are traditions in equity and there are certain rules. But at the end of the day, there ­­ it was never that formalistic and ­­ and ­­ and have the idea that someone could profit so much from their wrongdoing in frustrating an equitable claim that otherwise exists.",
  "So, Justice Kagan, I'd spot you that with respect to swollen assets, you know, which does come around in the 1930s, and so maybe there's an argument there. But ­­ but for example, substitutionary monetary decrees, Justice Holmes's opinions in 1897, exactly the same year as Barnes, the Chief Justice's opinion that was the foundation for Sereboff. And indeed, it has a tradition that goes back to Justice Story's 1828 treatise, which cites earlier cases even still. So I don't think that we're relying that.",
  "Well ­­ well, even if you can make that argument about deficiency judgments, which I'll respond to in a moment, you can't make it about substitution or monetary decrees, which is a distinct body in equity. And with respect to that, in 1864, absolutely. This Court promulgated Equity Rule 92, which allowed for deficiency judgments. But I think the fact that they had to issue a rule doesn't somehow make it a law claim, as my friend says. I mean, after all, Rule 73, promulgated in 1864, was a rule about preliminary injunctions. And I certainly think preliminary injunctions were available in equity, and, you know, the fact that there was a rule about it didn't somehow convert it into a law claim. So I think the very fact that this Court issued a rule called Equity Rule 10 is suggestive of the ­­ of the fact that this is a tradition in equity. Now, look, if there's some doubt about this, if there's some doubt on the traditions, and they've got ­­ I don't think they have a single case, but even if you thought they did, that said that we were prohibited ­­ that we were prohibited from making these claims at equity, I think you should err on the side of recognizing the claim. Why? For three reasons. One, because as the Solicitor General's brief in Sereboff said, the point of ERISA is to try and give effect to written plans and their determinations. And if there's doubt into the ­­ as to what the equity tradition is, you should read it in light of trying to enforce Plan terms. That is the pages 23 and 24 of their brief. It is consistent with the way this Court approaches, for example, Title VII cases and the like. The second is that, again, all we're seeking here is a remedy. We're not trying to get more than what would have been otherwise available at equity. Our ­­ our view is that when someone frustrates an otherwise equitable claim, we can only try and reinstate that claim. You can't get more from it because of their second wrongdoing. So I think we're giving effect to what equity is all about. And then, third ­­ and this goes back to your last question to Ms. Anders, you said, you know, what was ­­ what was the ­­ what does \"typically available at equity\" mean? And you know, that test comes from Mertens. Mertens isolates three examples of what was traditionally available as equity ­­ at equity: mandamus, injunction, and restitution. Now, if you look at mandamus, for example, there are precedents from this Court making ­­ that ­­ that suggest that equity ­­ that equity didn't recognize mandamus. You know, this Court twice in the nineteenth century in Hine and Downs both said that ­­ said that twice. And I think that's a good textual clue that when there's doubt as to whether something is actually traditionally available at equity or not, you should err on the side of recognizing it as traditionally available, as this Court did in the foundational Mertens test. We're not quibbling with Mertens. We're simply saying we're at least as strong as to whether something was traditionally available at equity as mandamus. Because in mandamus, two cases from this Court suggested it wasn't traditionally available, and yet, the Court still, in Mertens, used that as one of its three examples. If there are no further questions.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The facts of this tragic case place it squarely in the heartland of the sovereign tribal jurisdiction that this Court has recognized for decades. Dollar General set up shop on tribally­owned land with a lease and license from a tribe and agreed to participate in a tribal internship program. Then the ­­ then the Tribe placed a Choctaw child at the store and paid his wages. In the course of that consented­to employment of that child, in that store, on that tribal land, Dollar General's manager allegedly assaulted him.",

  "Mr. Chief Justice, that's exactly right in terms of describing ­­",
  "I don't think it's odd at all. That's the rule that this Court laid down. That's the language in Strate. And my friend, Mr. Goldstein's, best argument on the other side is your language in ­­ this Court's language in ­­",
  "Well, I think that ­­",
  "Well, Justice ­­ Justice Scalia, I think everything about this Court's precedents in this area, which are all tort cases, lead to that conclusion. Mr. Goldstein's best argument is Hicks. But remember in Hicks, the Court went out of its way to say that the claims in El Paso, which were very similar to the claims here ­­ it was a nonmember business doing business on tribal land. It was a tort lawsuit ­­ what did this Court say, citing to footnote 4 of El Paso? There is little doubt there was jurisdiction in that case. So yes, I understand that they are dicta, but it is dicta of the most persuasive sort. It is the unbroken rule of this Court, frankly, that in all of these cases, this Court has said there is presumptively jurisdiction. And indeed, the exhaustion cases would make no sense otherwise because twice this Court said, in tort cases, in Iowa Mutual and National Farmers Union, this Court said you've got to go to tribal court and exhaust your remedies. And Justice Scalia, if the rule in those cases was, hey, tribal courts don't have jurisdiction, they would have done what you did in your opinion in Hicks, because at page 369 you said, quote, \"Since it's clear tribal courts lack jurisdiction over State officials, adherence to the tribal exhaustion requirement would serve no purpose.\"",
  "No, it doesn't apply ­­",
  "Well, on tribal land we do think ­­ we don't think you have to go as far as the Solicitor General to say it's absolutely 100 percent dispositive, but we do think this Court has recognized in Merrion and El Paso that when you're on tribal lands, the tribe's powers are at their zenith.",
  "It depends a little bit more on the facts. In general, what this Court has said is that you need a consensual relationship with someone on the Tribe ­­ on tribal land. And so, you know, to the extent that that delivery service was operated by, you know, by the nonmember and that they're actually doing the delivery, absolutely. There's a nexus between the delivery and the injury. Now, if it was some exotic tort, so for example it's the delivery truck comes onto tribal land, and unbeknownst to them there's some unusual tradition that says delivery trucks have to be painted, you know, some other color or something like that that they don't know about, I think this Court's decision in Plains Commerce Bank says that's not what you're reasonably anticipating.

I think it's got to be something that's got to be reasonably anticipated, and I'm not really sure that that kind of thing is. All we're saying here is that this is a circumstance in which, as the Solicitor General's brief at Page 32 says, the law of every jurisdiction treats this kind of thing as something that is a reasonably anticipatory thing when someone's running a shop ­­ someone's running a store and having a Youth Opportunity Program. Yes, there ­­",
  "Yes. That ­­ that ­­ that I do think is something that ­­ you know, that my friend on the other side has said. But of course, as you were saying, Justice Ginsburg, removal is not constitutionally compelled. So it would require a statute. Here the removal statute requires diversity, full diversity between the parties, and $75,000 is the limit. And I don't think that we would say anything that doesn't fall within that is somehow not an incident of sovereignty. And I also would point to this Court's language in Iowa Mutual about the diversity statute, because what this Court said with respect to the diversity statute is, you know, it does require a statute. That statute doesn't really tell us anything, one way or the other, about tribal jurisdiction. And what this Court went on to say is that civil tribal tort jurisdiction is an incident to sovereignty. It's Williams v. Lee. It's about the right of the people to govern themselves. And, you know, to treat this, Justice Kennedy, like express consent is to treat a tribe the way you're treating the American Arbitration Association or JAMS, and that has never been what this Court has said. When you're dealing with the Montana I exception, which is a limited exception, it requires really ­­ you know, it requires a true relationship, an open and honest consent of the kind that existed here, in which they knew they were coming onto tribal lands and subjecting themselves to tribal law.",

  "Sure. I think that they could, on ­­ on either side. I think that's ­­ that's possible. But I think what this Court has said, time and again, is that that is not necessary. Your language, Mr. Chief Justice, in Plains Commerce Bank, is that you can consent by your words or your actions. This Court's earlier language in the path­marking Montana case is not that it requires express consent, but rather through commercial dealing, contracts, leases or other arrangements.

I don't think it's hard to do at all because the whole question is are you reasonably anticipating a certain amount of jurisdiction, and you are. And of course there's other solutions. Indemnity provisions; if you're worried about the due process ­­ lack of due process, you can have indemnity arrangements, as many leases do, including Dollar General's current lease.
