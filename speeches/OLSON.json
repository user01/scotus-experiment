  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: This case is controlled by the interaction of four principles, all designed to eliminate the danger of censorship by delay, from this Court's decisions on speech licensing schemes. First, in order to comply with the First Amendment, a speech licensing scheme that acts as a prior restraint must guarantee an applicant a prompt final administrative decision in a short, fixed period of time.",
  "Yes.",
  "It is a speech licensing scheme because it requires a license to operate an adult book store.",
  "You're correct.",
  "You're right that the Waukesha ordinance doesn't permit licensing decisions on its face to be made on the basis of content, but the Court I believe has recognized in City of Lakewood and in FW/PBS that licensing decisions that are not expressly content- based can still be used for covert content-based censorship.",
  "Yes.",
  "Not in this case. We will do that in some future case, but we have not made that argument in this case and we don't think the Court should reach that argument in this case. This is a case about procedures, not about the substantive disqualification criteria.",
  "Oh, all of those laws of general application that don't act as prior restraints targeted at speech can be enforced.",
  "They're targeted at speech in the sense that they're tied to the license, and they're tied to the permission to continue your ongoing speech.",
  "Those --",
  "If the requirement to have the electricity only applies to book stores, yes, it would be subject to the Freedman guarantees. If it applies to everybody, as all those building code requirements do as far as I know, then they're not subject to the Freedman guarantees, and that's what the Court said in Lakewood. The second principle that I think controls the Court's disposition of this case is that a speech licensing scheme violates the First Amendment if it permits the status quo to be altered to the applicant's detriment during the administrative proceedings.",
  "That's --",
  "That's absolutely correct. In Freedman and in Southeastern Promotions the Court said that a prior restraint before judicial review can be imposed only where it maintains the status quo. Where the status quo is speech, obviously you can't impose a prior restraint prior to judicial review, and in the tail-end of Southeastern Promotions the Court listed the constitutional deficiencies with the law at issue there, and one of the deficiencies listed was that it permitted the status quo to be altered to the applicant's detriment before judicial review.",
  "It was a new speech case, that's correct, but I believe the Court found that the status quo was altered to the applicant's detriment because the show in the presentation of Hair in Southeastern Promotions had to be postponed and they lost their date for the presentation. We believe that the third principle governing this case is that a licensing scheme that acts as a prior restraint must confer upon an unsuccessful applicant the right to prompt judicial review, and the fourth principle is that --",
  "We believe that's what Southeastern Promotions requires, and we believe that's the only way to prevent injury from lack of prompt judicial review.",
  "It's right that that's the rule we're urging the Court to find in Southeastern Promotions and FW/PBS and apply in this case, but it's wrong to say that it has nothing to do with the promptness of judicial review, I think, because the question on which the Court granted certiorari is does the licensing ordinance have to contain language to prevent injury from want of prompt judicial review, and the only way to prevent injury from want of prompt judicial review when you're enacting city licensing ordinance is to maintain the status quo, guarantee the status quo --",
  "Justice Scalia, it's not sufficient for five reasons. First, the timing of that sort of temporary relief is in the discretion of the circuit court and can depend on lots of factors, including docket pressure --",
  "Well, that really depends on what this Court says in this case. If the Court says in this case, as we urge it to say, that the status quo through judicial review must be guaranteed, then I suppose we could go into circuit court and get on the schedule for a motion and have the judge receive briefs and decide our motion and, after a period of time, issue an order implementing this Court's decision.",
  "No.",
  "I don't think that a stay order, the possibility of a stay order in the circuit court is an adequate substitute for Freedman safeguards, including maintenance of the status quo as written into the ordinance.",
  "Court of appeals.",
  "The court of appeals believed that the status quo would be maintained through the administrative proceedings automatically, and the court of appeals held that it wasn't necessary to maintain the status quo through the termination of judicial proceedings.",
  "Well, we wouldn't have much of a claim on a stay today except by making the arguments from Freedman and Southeastern Promotions that we're making here today.",
  "We could. That would be an argument going to the merits of the claim and, of course, it would be relevant to the issuance of a stay, because we have to show probability of success.",
  "I don't even get to whether we're entitled to an automatic stay in my thinking, because I don't think that the possibility of a stay being imposed in a discretionary manner in the circuit court is sufficient to satisfy Southeastern Promotions, Freedman,",
  "Or some provision is unconstitutional.",
  "In an as-applied challenge that would be correct, but this is a facial challenge.",
  "If that were always true, then --",
  "-- the court wouldn't have to worry about a specific guarantee --",
  "Getting that stay does require us to show a reasonable probability of success on the merits.",
  "Not -- not really, in terms of timing especially. We can't show a reasonable probability of success on the merits in an administrative review until that administrative record gets to the court, and there's no time limit on that under the unamended ordinance.",
  "That's correct, and we have no as- applied challenge here. This is strictly a facial challenge case.",
  "Our client is still just barely in business operating as a nonadult store, and intending to close even that operation within a matter of days, but as we pointed out in our brief --",
  "The case isn't moot because there's a disability from licensure that flows from having violated the ordinance by operating without a license, which I told them they were entitled to do under Shuttlesworth, because --",
  "Well, there's no showing that they intend to engage in this business, or that they have not applied for a new license and they don't have an application pending now, but they haven't foresworn any intention to apply for a license at some other location in the future.",
  "Not -- my client has a real, concrete interest in having a facially valid, constitutional ordinance on the book in Waukesha. City News and Novelty and its officers have real interests in that --",
  "Yes. The City News and Novelty is footing the bill for this case because they believe they're right, they believe in it's important principle, and they don't want the 5-year disability from licensure that will fall on the corporation and its officers. If they're determined to have been operating without a license in violation of a valid ordinance up until February 14, 2000, which is when they stopped operating as an adult book store, they'd be disabled from licensure in Waukesha for 5 years after that, until Valentine's Day 2005.",
  "Justice Scalia, they do in the following sense. If there is no valid judicial review path in this licensing ordinance, then there's no valid renewal mechanism, and the whole licensing requirement becomes facially invalid. Then they're entitled to operate without a license.",
  "My client was allowed to continue, but my client was entitled to have that guaranteed on the face of the ordinance, and we contend that the --",
  "That's right. There are some of the cases going to the requirement of, for example, explicit and specific and objective licensing standards that recognize that these could be -- these could come from usage or authoritative construction, as well as on the face of the legislation, but here there is no usage or authoritative construction that builds a status quo --",
  "Well, as far as I know, this is the only establishment ever to be licensed in Waukesha as an adult book store. There's nothing --",
  "The Court has held in more than one case that license applicants are entitled more to the hope of the grace -- to more than the hope of the grace of the Government. They're entitled to a guarantee. In other words, maybe they will. Maybe they will let the next guy stay open, too, or maybe they'll say that we let Olson's clients stay open because that was test case, raising constitutional issues about our ordinance and we weren't sure how it was going to come out, now we know, so you've got to close with our nonrenewal decision. We're entitled --",
  "Yes, I think it does. I think if we were making an as-applied challenge the -- Justice Scalia would be right in the sense that we haven't suffered any injury, because we were allowed to remain open. The fact that we're making a facial challenge, I think first of all it focuses the Court's attention on the ordinance as it stood in 1995, and that's -- in '96, and that it prevents it from being mooted out by the subsequent amendments to the ordinance that have taken place four times this year.",
  "Yes.",
  "Correct.",
  "Correct.",
  "Well --",
  "Sure.",
  "The third parties are protected from a couple of the original problems. They're protected from indefinite time -- indefinite times in the administrative procedure. But they're not protected from lack of prompt judicial review and lack of preservation of the status quo during judicial review. The third parties out there who will apply for renewal in the future under this ordinance will still face those facial problems with the scheme as it stands today.",
  "I think your cases prevent you from assuming that we are in the same boat with them. I think they prevent you from assuming that they won't be required to close pending judicial review, for example, or that --",
  "Because --",
  "We got the grace of the Government and a special dispensation to be allowed to remain open. Future applicants, there's no reason to believe that they will get that, and they are entitled --",
  "Maybe not totally out of the market. They might want to apply for a license at some other location.",
  "Setting that particular organization aside and looking at future operations that might be deciding whether or not to locate in Waukesha, I don't think it's beyond the stretch of the imagination to suggest that they might decide to go elsewhere if this Court decides that Waukesha's ordinance is just fine and you can be nonrenewed administratively for popcorn on the floor, and you have to close until you get a judicial decision on the merits that that's an unconstitutional criterion.",
  "We do contend that, and we do contend that at least on remand the nonrenewal order will have to be vacated because it was issued pursuant to an unconstitutional licensing scheme. And with the Court's permission, I'd like to reserve my time.",
  "Thank you. If I'm operating a radio station and the city takes my license away because I've let the fence around my tower get into slight disrepair, and my defense is that the provision of the ordinance that says you can lose your license for having your fence in disrepair slightly is unconstitutional, I can't even raise that defense until I get to court, and if I don't get prompt judicial review or a stay of the status quo and be allowed to operate until my judicial decision, I will in all likelihood be out of business and I won't have any effective judicial review on that constitutional defense, and the administrative process can't touch that constitutional argument. This Court's decisions are clear that delay in a licensing process can lead to content-based censorship just as easy as lack of standards, even in a situation where licensing decisions are not expressly based on the content of the material. Lakewood I think also warns us that an ongoing business is a more likely target of content-based discrimination in the licensing process at the administrative level. The --",
  "On the face of the ordinance, those violations may or may not be very serious. Nonrenewal is required for one single, trivial violation of a provision of the ordinance that may well be unconstitutional. We can't test the constitutionality of that provision on the face of the ordinance until we get to court. There are really large numbers of people out there, highly motivated, with influence in municipal affairs, who are waiting for this Court to give them an opening for the covert censorship of sexually explicit speech through delay of licensure, or through any other method that allows room for indirect action. Not only my client, as an adult book store, but other people who are engaging in unpopular speech and mainstream media ask this Court not to create that opening for covert censorship by delay of the judicial review until that delay becomes fatal to many businesses who won't have meaningful judicial review because they'll just die on the vine while they're waiting for a judicial decision. A temporary injunction that they have to take the burden of getting in circuit court is not going to be an answer. First of all, it's the kind of cumbersome and time-consuming and expensive measure that, as Justice Harlan, concurring in Shuttlesworth, said, you shouldn't have to engage in to pursue your free speech rights, and second, it's a flawed process because you have to wait for the administrative record to prove you've got a chance of prevailing.",
  "Thank you.",
  "And may it please the Court: Two weeks after the November 7 presidential election, the Florida Supreme Court overturned and materially rewrote portions of the carefully formulated set of laws enacted by Florida's legislature to govern the conduct of that election and the determination of controversies with respect to who prevailed on November 7th. These laws have been formulated by the Florida legislature pursuant to an express delegation of authority, to wit, by the United States Constitution. The election code that the Florida legislature developed conformed to Title 3, Section 5 of the United States Code. That provision invites states to devise rules in advance of an election, to govern the counting of votes and the settling of election controversy.",
  "We do, Justice O'Connor. It is a safe harbor, but it's more than that. And Section 5 of Title 3 needs to be construed in connection with the history that brought it forth --",
  "That's why I've mentioned the context in which that section was adopted. In light of the extreme controversy that was faced by this country as a result of the 1876 election, and as this Court knows, that election was very close and led to controversy, contest, discord, Congress was very much concerned about the possibility of that happening again, and one of the reasons --",
  "Justice Kennedy, I submit that it is much like a compact that Congress is offering in the form of Section 5, yes. If you do these things, certain things will happen. But among these things, what Congress wanted to accomplish with Section 5 was not only to provide the benefit to the states, but to provide the benefit to the United States of the states accepting that implicit proposal.",
  "Well, I think the fact is that it did not. What it did was it disregarded the compact. When the state adopted a code of ethics, or a code of election procedures to govern the election and the determination of disputes pursuant to the election, it brought itself into that safe harbor and guaranteed to the voters and the candidates in that state that the controversy and turmoil that infected this country after the 1876 --",
  "Well, I certainly agree that it mentioned those provisions. I'm simply saying that it blew past the important provisions of Section 5 and the benefits that Section 5 gives to the states to the voters in that state and to the people running for office in that state. That is to say that if the rules are complied with, if disputes are resolved according to the rules that are set forth, then not only will the electors chosen by the voters in that state be given conclusive effect at the time they are counted by Congress but we will not have the controversy, dispute and chaos that's been taking place in Florida.",
  "No, I don't think so.",
  "This is a great deal different because this is -- first of all, Article II of the Constitution which vests authority to establish the rules exclusively in the legislatures of the state, tie in with Section 5. Secondly, as this Court has stated --",
  "I think it -- I think it can't be divorced from Article II of the Constitution because it's a part of a plan for the vesting in the legislatures of a state, and Section 5 implements Article II in the sense that it provides a benefit not just to the state but to the voters.",
  "Well, I think that the state did not pay, the state supreme court did not pay much attention to the Federal statute. It was obviously aware of it. It did get the Federal principle --",
  "Well, there is a Federal--",
  "Well, we believe that there is, Justice Kennedy, because although the state recognized it, it blew right past it. The state legislature adopted the code that the Section 5 of Article 3 of Title 3 invited it to do. The state supreme court, which had no right under the Constitution, but I can't divorce the constitutional provision from Section 5, then overturned the plan that the state enacted through its legislature to make sure that what happened down in Florida was not going to happen. And so what the state supreme court did, knowing full well that these provisions existed, overturned the carefully enacted plan by Florida.",
  "I think that it was intend -- directed to Congress, but it seems to me that in the context in which it was adopted and the promise that it afforded, that the conclusive effect would be given to the state selection of electors, that is a somewhat empty remedy and it doesn't accomplish Congress' objectives if it cannot be enforced when an agency of the state government steps in as the Florida Supreme Court did here and overturn the plan by which the Florida legislature carefully set forth a program so that disputes could be resolved, and we wouldn't have the controversy, conflict and chaos that we submit exists today in Florida.",
  "Justice Stevens, I don't think that in this case that's even remotely arguable. What the state supreme court did is take a set of timetables, a set of provisions that --",
  "No. Not necessarily. But the 102 -- there is the two provisions, Section 102.111 and 102.112. 111 contains the shall date, 102 contains the may date.",
  "Both of those statutes, both of those provisions say that the returns must be, or shall be filed by a certain deadline. The shall and the may provisions simply relate to the possible remedy. We submit that under either interpretation the Secretary of State of Florida either must or shall ignore those returns, or may set those aside in her discretion.",
  "Yes, I believe --",
  "Yes.",
  "I don't think so. She took the position --",
  "That's --",
  "I don't know of any. I haven't thought of any, Justice Stevens.",
  "Well, the problem is that it's -- what we are saying is that either it's mandatory, in which case she could not accept them.",
  "Well, the Florida Supreme Court and what the circuit court did in that case, it said that it wasn't -- and we'll accept this for purposes of this argument that it wasn't --",
  "I think that we can answer that this way, is that whether it was shall ignore or may ignore. It was not must accept.",
  "No, under no circumstances was it must accept. Now --",
  "I don't believe so, Justice Stevens.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, what the court did was so constrain those circumstances, virtually to make them nonexistent.",
  "I think that -- yes, but I think that it has to be looked at in the context in which that was done when the state supreme court so constrained and says in its opinion shall accept these late returns until 5 p.m. on November 26th, and in the context there was no discretion left for the Secretary of State at all.",
  "Up to.",
  "The first part of the recount provision to which you're referring, Justice Ginsburg, says may conduct a recount. Under certain circumstances after the sampling part of that process is taken, if it's taken in the county canvassing board's discretion, then under certain circumstances it's supposed to go forward with a more fulsome process, but the legislature being fully aware of the recount provisions and the importance of -- this ties in with the protest period for the election, which overlaps the recount provisions, and the contest provision for the election, and the fact that all of this has to be done in the context of a presidential election. Under any other kind of election, these things wouldn't be nearly as important, but we have very important timetables, and as this Court has said a presidential election is so important to the rest of the nation, and there is such high Federal interest in accomplishing these things in the right way, what the Florida legislature did is balance the protest period, the recount period with the contest period, and state that there shall be certain deadlines before which certain things need to be done and after which, so what those two statutes say is that there may be a recount, but that there shall be compliance with the time deadline. It also says that --",
  "This is a very unusual situation, Justice Ginsburg, because it is in the context of a presidential election, and it is in the context of Federal rights. This Court has, in the areas in which we've described in our brief, undertaken to review the meaning and the effect that the state supreme court or state court decision under certain circumstances. We submit this is one. What the Florida Supreme --",
  "Yes, but then the Court has also said, then we go on to see the extent to which what the state court did, as we cited in the Lindsey case, for example, in the ex post facto context, we go on to see what the import of that is in connection with the Federal right. I would emphasize that what the Florida Supreme Court did is basically essentially say, we're rewriting the statute, we're changing it.",
  "The Secretary of State did. It doesn't -- she doesn't much anymore because what has happened -- and I would like to finish that one point, that the Florida Supreme Court said we are not going to be bound by technical statutory requirements or what the supreme court called hyper-technical statutory requirements. Instead, we are going to resort to the will of the people, the will of the electorate, the will of the voters, so to speak, and we are going to -- because we can't rewrite the statute, but we are going to partially rewrite the statute, we are going to resort to our equitable powers. So what -- and among the things that the court did, and there are a range of them, as I have indicated, they took away the discretion of the Secretary and instructed her to accept these manual recount returns.",
  "No, it wouldn't have been, but --",
  "They recited four canons of statutory construction, Justice Stevens, but when they said they use those construction -- canons of statutory construction to say that the words may and shall mean shall not, that is not a reasonable exercise of statutory construction. I think what the -- it's relatively obvious that what the supreme court did is exactly what Article -- Section 5 of Article III intends not to happen. Change the rules.",
  "Well, yes, I agree with that up to a point, but then it says that she must accept these returns that are after the deadline.",
  "That's right, but -- so there was both going on, and what the court was bound and determined to do was to get to a consequence that the court determined was consistent with the will of the people, irrespective of what the statute --",
  "I would like to answer that in two ways. In the first place, I don't mean to suggest, and I hope my words didn't, that there was a lack of integrity or any dishonesty by the Florida Supreme Court. What we're saying, that it was acting far outside the scope of its authority in connection with an exercise of power that is vested by the Constitution of the United States --",
  "But -- under almost any other circumstances, yes, Justice Ginsburg, but in this context, in this context, we are talking about a Federal right, a Federal constitutional right, and the rights of individual citizens under the Constitution and so therefore, this Court has a grave responsibility to look --",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, we are very definitely relying on Article II of the Constitution. The framers of the Constitution debated long and hard. It was one of the longest debates that took place during the formation of the Constitution. Where should this power be lodged, in the Federal legislature, in the state legislature, at the ballot booth or what. The one thing that was discussed and rejected by virtually everyone is that the power to select the manner in which electors would be appointed would be in the state judiciary, and we quote -- in the state judiciary. That was rejected. The notion that it would be vested in the state judiciary was something that was rejected, and what the framers decided to do is to vest it in the state legislature and vested that authority under Article II, not just in the state, but the legislature.",
  "Well, it is -- yes, it said that, Justice Kennedy. But what it did was supplant a set of rules elect -- enacted before the election to govern the election, for a set of rules made up after the election.",
  "Because I submit that that writes Section 5 essentially out of existence if an agency of state government, if a state legislature --",
  "If the state agency, if the state legislature empowered by Article II of the Constitution, does what it is invited to do by Section 5, and then another agency of state government, in this case the state supreme court, comes along and upsets that scheme, yes, you have ultimate resort to the resolution of the dispute under Sections 15 of Title 3, but that's precisely --",
  "Well, I'm not making myself clear, I think, is that the importance of Section 5 was to invite the state to do things that would avoid the chaos and the conflict and the controversy and the unsettled situation that this country faced in 1876, and --",
  "I don't know, Justice Scalia. I don't know the answer to that, when it was adopted. I can't recall whether it was a part of the 1887 electoral count statute or not. I can probably answer that in regard --",
  "Well, it seems to me it wouldn't make a difference, because of this. It might -- yes, it certainly might make a difference one way, but it still wouldn't make a difference because our concept here, and I think it's quite a rational and actually the only explanation for how you can put these provisions together, Article II and Section 5, and Congress' desire to avoid the very controversy, chaos, conflict, which even --",
  "Yes.",
  "But that's what the country -- what essentially Section 15, although it modifies it and structures it somewhat, it was still a situation that Congress was facing in 1876 when it was dealing with the Hayes-Tilden election.",
  "And by the time it got there, there were dueling slates of electors that were buying -- there were exchanges and a lot of things that everyone felt was very destructive to the country.",
  "Correct.",
  "I think that's a very important point, and let me make it: That Congress did say if you do these things, certain consequences will flow from it. Florida did these things, and we submit that there is, that the courts are here to protect the benefit of the bargain that Florida made when it responded to that invitation, because --",
  "No, I don't think so.",
  "That's not a fair reading of Section 5, and let me answer this question, and I would like with the Court's permission to reserve the time --",
  "I don't think that they can be read in isolation. I think that Section 5 was designed to avoid the problem created by the controversy and the having to resolve this in Congress, which is exactly what did happen in 1876, and was a very unsatisfactory situation.",
  "That's right. And it put those rules with respect to conclusiveness into Section 5. The Florida legislature bought into that scheme and now the Florida Supreme Court, which doesn't have any Constitutional authority pursuant to Section 2 to do so, upset that scheme, deprived Florida of the benefit of doing exactly what Congress wanted to have happen under Section 5. I would, with the Court's permission, reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. May it please the Court: It seems to me that it's very difficult to read the Florida Supreme Court decision as saying anything else other than the Florida Constitution in their view, in that court's view, is trumping everything else. The second paragraph of the conclusion says because the right to vote is the preeminent right in the declaration of rights of the Florida Constitution and so forth, this opinion is full of language --",
  "They are sayihng --",
  "I think that the only reasonable fair reading of the decision is that the Florida Supreme Court felt that, and it says it over and over again, that we are going to be -- attempt to discern the will of the people, the will of the electorate and discern, and enhance in whatever way we possibly can the right to vote. And because of that, these provisions of the statute which are very much quintessentially legislative, the timetables that are involved in this statute, particularly the November 14th deadline, is a part of a composite package. There is one week for a protest and certain recounts to the extent that they can be done and there are four weeks for contests. When the Florida Supreme Court truncated, when the Florida Supreme Court expanded the protest period from 7 days to 19 days, it necessarily limited the contest period to a shorter period of time. It changed the discretion. It allowed certain things to occur that couldn't have occurred and it justifies all of those things on the grounds that the Florida Supreme Court, the Florida Constitution trumps those legislative concerns, and that's why it said we are not going to be dissuaded by hypertechnical statutory considerations. So the court was doing what this Court said in the McPherson vs. Blacker case that it cannot do, allow itself to insert itself or the Florida Constitution over what is required by Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution. It also seems to me quite evident in response to what Justice Kennedy was asking earlier, that there was concern about the Federal statutory provision, the language to which I think Justice Kennedy was referring is on page 32-A of the appendix to the petition from the court's decision, and there is a footnote there that does refer to reference to 3 U.S.C. 1 through 10, which of course includes Section 5, and it says so in conjunction with the statement that the exercise of the discretion by the secretary of state could not be done in such a way that would preclude Florida voters from participating fully in the Federal electoral process. The court was assuming, it seems to me, that it did not, was not conflict -- the decision that it was rendering was not going to cause a conflict with the Federal statutory scheme, and it was, we submit, in error in that regard. So the -- the -- to sum up with respect to this, the Florida Supreme Court radically changed the legislative scheme because it thought it could do so under the Florida Constitution. By doing so, it acted inconsistently with Article II of the Constitution, and inconsistently with Section 5 of Title III, and it has brought about precisely the circumstances that Section 5 of Section 3, Title III, was designed to avoid.",
  "The very second paragraph refers to the Florida Constitution and the rights to vote. Page 36-A of the appendix to the petition.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and may it please the Court: Just one week ago, this Court vacated the Florida Supreme Court's November 21 revision of Florida's election code, which had changed statutory deadlines, severely limited the discretion of the State's chief election officer, changed the meaning of words such as shall and may into shall not and may not, and authorized extensive standardless and unequal manual ballot recounts in selected Florida counties. Just four days later, without a single reference to this Court's December 4 ruling, the Florida Supreme Court issued a new, wholesale post-election revision of Florida's election law. That decision not only changed Florida election law yet again, it also explicitly referred to, relied upon, and expanded its November 21 judgment that this Court had made into a nullity.",
  "The federal question arises out of the fact that the Florida Supreme Court was violating Article II, section 1 of the Constitution, and it was conducting itself in violation of section 5 of Title III of federal law.",
  "Justice Kennedy, the Constitution specifically vested the authority to determine the manner of the appointment of the electors in state legislatures. Legislatures, of course can use the executive branch in the states, and it may use in its discretion the judicial branch.",
  "It did not do that here because it did not specify -- it did use the executive branch. In fact, it vested considerable authority in the Secretary of State, designating the Secretary of State as the chief elections official, and as we point out, the very first provision in the election code requires the Secretary of State to assure uniformity and consistency in the application and enforcement of the election law. The Secretary of State as the executive branch is also given considerably -- considerable other responsibilities, when but -- and to a certain extent, especially in connection with the contest phase of the election, certain authority was explicitly vested in the Circuit Court of the State of Florida, which is the trial court.",
  "Certainly the legislature did not have to provide appellate review.",
  "Well, there are -- there is a breakout with respect to various aspects of Florida statute and Florida election law. There is a specific grant of authority to the circuit courts. There is no reference to an appellate jurisdiction. It may not be the most powerful argument we bring to this Court.",
  "Because notwithstanding, notwithstanding -- well, the fact is that the Constitution may have been invoked.",
  "No, I would say this with respect -- it would have been a perfectly logical, and if you read the statutes, a perfectly logical, especially in the context of a presidential election, to stop this process at the circuit court, and not provide layers of appeal because given the time deadline, especially in the context of this election, the way it's played out, there is not time for an appellate court.",
  "I think that I don't disagree with that except to the extent that I think that the argument we presented and amplified on in our briefs is a good argument, it's a solid argument. It is consistent with the way the code is set up, and it's particularly consistent with the timetable that's available in a presidential election. However --.",
  "No, I think that it is particularly in this case where there's been two wholesale revisions, major restructuring of the Florida Election Code, we don't even get close to that question at all. It would be unfortunate to assume that the legislature devolved this authority on its judiciary sub silentio. There is no specific reference to it. But in this case, as we have pointed out, especially the decision of last Friday, there was a major overhaul in almost every conceivable way.",
  "No, I don't think it's necessary.",
  "Well, I think those cases support the argument, but as we said --.",
  "I think in a different context, it's not necessarily the case, and certainly it is true that legislatures can employ the legislative process that might include vetoes by a state chief executive, or a referendum, when the state deliberately chooses to choose a legislative method to articulate a code. The point I think that's most important and most --.",
  "No, Article II -- we do not contend that Article II would prohibit them from fulfilling that process.",
  "In the context of this case we're saying that they can include the judicial branch when they wish to do so, but under no circumstances is it consistent with the concept of the plan in the Constitution for the state, sub siletio, the state legislature sub silentio to turn over to the judiciary the power to completely reverse, revise, and change the election code in all of the major respects --.",
  "That's entirely possible that that might be the case, Justice Ginsburg, but the entire text of the McPherson decision and its recitation of the legislative history or the history of legislation and acts by state legislatures to comply with it make it quite clear that the power is vested in the legislature itself.",
  "I think the context of that case is different, and that it's entirely possible for the Court to have come to the conclusion it did in that case and we believe that case is compelling for the principle that we are arguing in this case, that there is no, the entire structure of what Florida did, its election code, in its effort to comply not only with Article II, but with Section 5 of Title 3, is such that it did not intend in any way to divest itself of the power to determine how the appointment of electors would be determined in a federal presidential election and most importantly, the resolution of cases and controversies, and disputes, with respect to the appointments --.",
  "And I think that that's important. I agree with you, Justice Ginsburg. It's not the most clearly written opinion. But I think that in the context of that case, the relationship of the legislature to the Constitution in that case and the way that power was exercised, that ought to be reconciled with what we are urging the Court today, that a wholesale revision and abandonment of the legislative authority can't be turned over, especially sub silentio, by a legislature simply because there is a constitution. There is a constitution in every state. There is a judiciary in every state. The judiciary performs certain functions in every state, and to go that length, one would assume that the judiciary in every state under that argument could overturn, rewrite, revise, and change the election law in presidential elections notwithstanding Article II, at will. Now, this was a major, major revision that took place on Friday.",
  "Well, I think that the dissenting opinion and the two dissenting opinions are very informative. We are relying on what the court did. If one looks at, for example, the recount provisions, before this revision under Florida law, manual recount under the protest provisions were discretionary, completely discretionary, conducted by canvassing boards during the protest phase of the election, post-election period, pursuant to legislatively defined procedures as to who could be present, for seven days after the election with respect to all ballots in a county, that was mandatory and only available, as we heard last week, for tabulation error up until this election. After the decision of December 8th in this context, those remand provisions, I mean those recount, manual recount provisions became mandatory instead of discretionary pursuant to judicial rather than executive supervsion during the contest phase rather than the protest phase, even though it's not even mentioned in the statute with respect to the contest phase, pursuant to ad hoc judicially established procedures rather than the procedures that are articulated quite carefully in the statute.",
  "Well, to read that, to read that provision and it's written quite broadly, but to read that, one has to read that in the context of the entire statutory framework. If one reads it the way the Florida Supreme Court did, the entire process is tilted on its head. Where there used to be the decision that was in the election officials, it now becomes in the court. All of the limitations on the remand process that existed during the protest phase, where the standards should be lower because it's earlier in the process are thrown out the window. The time tables are thrown out the window. The process that exists are there and one has to -- .",
  "There is no timetable.",
  "But that's only if you untether 168 entirely from the statute and the steam by which the protest phase takes place over a period of seven to 10 days in the context of this election, and the contest phase occurs over the next four weeks.",
  "Well, I am hoping to convince you that they passed far beyond the normal limits of statutory construction. The changing of the meaning -- .",
  "It is, it is, we submit an utter revision of the timetables, the allocation.",
  "That's correct.",
  "We are not just saying timetables. We are saying that it has wrenched it completely out of the election code which the legislature very carefully crafted to fit together and work in an interrelated fashion. It isn't just the timetable. The fact that there are timetables which are very important in a presidential election, we are today smack up against a very important deadline, and we are in the process where -- .",
  "Well, I believe that the Supreme Court of Florida certainly thought that it was construing, it certainly said so this time, that it was construing the applicability of Section 5 and it was expressing the hope that what it was doing was not risking or jeopardizing the conclusive effect -- .",
  "And we submit that it incorrectly interpreted and construed federal law in doing that because what they have inevitably done is provide a process whereby it is virtually impossible, if not completely impossible, and I think it is completely impossible, to have these issues resolved and the controversies resolved in time for that federal statutory deadline. Furthermore, it is quite clear, we submit, that the process has changed.",
  "Well, because we said -- .",
  "Because we argued, and I believe that there is a very firm basis for saying that that process already had violated Article II of the Constitution. It was also already throwing in jeopardy compliance with Section 5 of Title 3 because the laws had been changed in a number of different respects and we have recited them. The timetables are important.",
  "Pardon me?",
  "Well, one fair standard, and I don't know the complete answer to that, is that there would be a uniform way of evaluating the manner in which -- there was Palm Beach, for example --.",
  "Well, the standard -- .",
  "We want -- .",
  "Well, certainly at minimum, Justice Breyer, the penetration of the ballot card would be required. Now, that's why I mentioned the Palm Beach standard that was articulated in writing and provided along with the ballot instructions to people voting, that the chad ought to be punctured.",
  "It's certainly a starting point, and the --.",
  "That is correct.",
  "I would agree with that, Justice O'Connor.",
  "She had not set one, and that's one of the objections that we had with respect to the process that -- the selective process that existed and that we discussed in conjunction with the December -- the November 21st position. Not only was there not a standard, but there was a change two or three times during the course of this process with respect to the standard that I was just discussing.",
  "I don't think there is. There is no limitation on when she can answer advisory opinions.",
  "I don't -- I think that that's correct. Now, whether or not if there was a change as a result of that, of the process, whether there would be problems with respect to section 5 I haven't thought about , but --.",
  "I think it would be feasible. Now, counsel for the Secretary of State will be up in a moment, immediately after me. As I understand, however, the election code, she would have the power to respond to that inquiry. In fact, under the very first, as I mentioned, the very first section of the election code, sub 1, she is not only the chief election officer, but has responsibility --.",
  "Well, certainly one that would -- I don't -- I haven't crafted it entirely out. That is the job for a legislature.",
  "I think part of that standard is it would have to be applied uniformly. It would have to be -- I would think a reasonable standard is, would have to be at minimum a penetration of the chad in the ballot, because indentations are no standards at all. There are other procedural standards in the --.",
  "I believe it was not, Justice Stevens.",
  "No, I don't think it's a fair inference either way. Remember in response to the question from I think it was Justice Scalia the last time we were here, this is the first time we've had a manual recount for anything other than arithmetic tabulation error. This is something that is unprecedented in the State of Florida. That's another change that took place.",
  "Well, I think we have to distinguish between whether we're talking about a prospective uniform standard as opposed to something that changes the process in the middle of the counting and evaluating of disputes. But it certainly would --.",
  "But we submit in the context of the entire election code itself. Now, the intent of the voter standard, the one that's been cited and relied upon by our opponents most, is a provision that's contained in the provision of the election code that deals with damaged or spoiled ballots.",
  "I don't think it would be a violation of Article II provided that -- I mean, if the first part of your question --.",
  "If we went from the standard that existed before, the dimpled chads, that that had not been a standard anywhere in Florida, if that change was made, we would strongly urge that that would be a violation of Article II.",
  "It would be a complete change.",
  "That's absolutely correct, Justice Scalia.",
  "That's correct, they've been euphemistically -- this has been euphemistically referred to as legal votes that haven't been counted. These are ballots where the system created by Florida, both with respect to the initial tabulation and the preferred system for the recount, the automatic recount in close elections, is to submit those ballots to the same mechanical objective scrutiny that the initial count was done, and those were not counted either because there were votes for more than one candidate, which would make them overvotes, I guess they're calling them, or that they read as no vote, which many people do, many people do not vote in the presidential election even though they're voting for other offices.",
  "Yes, that is our contention, and that has to be done. That contention is based upon everything else in the Florida statute, including the contest provisions. The manual recount provisions --.",
  "Because there is no reference to them, even though that process is referred to --.",
  "In the context, in the context of the statute as a whole, manual recounts are treated quite extensively as a last resort for tabulation error at the discretion of canvassing officials.",
  "That's correct.",
  "We submit -- and I would like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "I'm sorry, I missed --.",
  "I don't think it's critical. What we're saying is that the court expanded upon its previous decision that was vacated in this case, it used the time period that it opened up to do this manual recount to then build upon in the December 8th opinion.",
  "Yes, Your Honor, but this Court in its opinion that it handed down in the initial Harris case pointed out that it was clear that there was a desire in which by the legislature to preserve the safe harbor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I would like to start with a point or two with respect to the equal protection due process component of this case. The Florida Democratic Party on November 20 was asking the -- november 20th of this year, was asking the Florida Supreme Court to establish uniform standards with respect to the looking at and evaluating these ballots, a recognition that there were no uniform standards and that there ought to be. Last Tuesday in the 11th Circuit, unless I misheard him, the attorney for the Attorney General of Florida said that the standards for evaluating these ballots are evolving. There is no question, based upon this record, that there are different standards from county to county.",
  "Certainly the standard should be that similarly situated voters and similarly situated ballots ought to be evaluated by comparable standards.",
  "You're certainly going to have to look at a ballot that you mark in one way different than these punch card ballots. Our point is, with respect to the punch card ballots, is that there are different standards for evaluating those ballots from county to county and it is a documented history in this case that there have been different standards between November 7th and the present with respect to how those punch card ballots are evaluated. Palm Springs is the best example. They started with a clear rule which had been articulated and explained to the voters, by the way, as of 1990. Then they got into the process of evaluating these ballots and changed the standard from moment to moment during the first day and again, they evolved from the standard that the chad had to be punched through to the so-called dimpled ballot standard, indentations on the ballot. There was a reason why that was done. It was because they weren't producing enough additional votes so that there's pressure on to change the standards. And that will happen in a situation which is where the process is ultimately subjective, completely up to the discretion of the official, and there's no requirement of any uniformity. Now, we now have something that's worse than that. We have standards that are different throughout 64 different counties. We've got only undercounts being considered where an indentation on a ballot will now be counted as a vote, but other ballots that may have indentations aren't going to be counted at all. The overvotes are in a different category, and in this very remedy the ballots in Miami-Dade are being treated differently. Some of them have been all examined and the balance of the process, the remaining 80 percent will be looked at only in connection with the undercounts.",
  "I'm not sure I know the answer to that question, whether that would render academic the challenge. There is a clear constitutional violation, in our opinion, with respect to Article II because virtually every aspect of Florida's election code has been changed as a result of these two decisions.",
  "The only thing I can say in response to that is that what this Court said one week ago today, that as a general rule the court defers to a state court's interpretation of a state statute, but not where the legislature is acting under authority granted to it by the Constitution of the United States. The final point I would like to make is with respect to section 5. It is quite clear that the court in both the earlier decision and the decision last Friday was aware and concerned about compliance with section 5. It construed section 5 in a way that allowed it by labeling what it was doing as interpretation to change in dramatic respects the Florida election law, and we submit because it did, so misconstrued the applicability not only with respect to finality but the other part of section 5 requires a determination of controversies pursuant to a set of laws that are in place at the time of the elections.",
  "I don't believe so because we know different standards were being applied to get to that point, and they were having different results.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The colloquy that we have just heard illustrates why this Court has said over and over again in the context of ratemaking, in precisely the context we're talking about here, that the Court evaluates results not methodologies; impacts, not means; and consequences, not techniques.",
  "Well, there might be --",
  "This Court has said that the challenger of a rate has a heavy burden to make a convincing case that the outcome is confiscatory. Now, that burden can't be achieved -- Justice Ginsburg's questions at the end of this colloquy illustrate that there are a number -- and -- and the questions about depreciation and cost of capital illustrate all of the things that -- the reasons why this Court has avoided deciding whether a methodology is acceptable or not.",
  "Well, the -- the person who challenges the way the commission is setting rates has to -- has to present to this Court an explanation for why that the system that's developed, whether it's spinning a wheel or whatever -- and I -- I won't engage in that hypothetical because we've got a several hundred page record that looked into various different arguments with respect to various different methods of recovery. It listened to various -- the FCC listened to various different experts. It listened to the incumbent local exchange carriers' various different theories. It has explained why it did. It developed a forward-looking technology, a method of evaluating the entry fees that would be based upon the statute.",
  "Well, no, I don't agree.",
  "No, it does have to be. And this Court should wait to see whether that really happens or not. In the first place, this Court has said over and over again that the ratemaker has the responsibility and obligation and right under the Constitution to consider the goals of the statute, different theories, mixed -- mixed methodologies, and all of those things so that the Court -- we can't determine -- there's a lot of allegations in the briefs and in this entire case about the draconian impact of this methodology. But as the colloquy that took place here with respect to both depreciation and return of capital illustrated, in the precise paragraphs that my opponent cited with respect to these things illustrate the point. Once the forward method -- forward-looking technology method is applied, the State -- the States are determining the rates which these carriers will receive for the elements. And they may be only elements of the system. They get to continue to operate the system, to make profit, to reimburse themselves for whatever costs they've embedded. They've said that they're not challenging the rates. They're not challenging the outcome because once the forward-looking technology that the FCC specified in detail after long, detailed, methodical consideration -- said that then the States will look at questions of depreciation and cost of capital. The paragraph that you read back, Mr. Chief Justice, the sentence in paragraph 702, which is on page 396 of the joint appendix, specifically says, States may adjust the cost of capital if a party demonstrates to a State commission that either a higher or lower level of cost of capital is warranted, et cetera, et cetera.",
  "By the circumstances and -- and the constitutional obligation to set a reasonable rate under the statute considering this methodology and limited by the constitutional standard that this Court has articulated as the lowest reasonable rate, a rate that is not confiscatory.",
  "Well, this Court --",
  "Well, this Court has repeatedly said that it has refused to constitutionalize the embedded cost or historical cost formulation. Most recently it said that in the Duquesne case.",
  "That argument is made, but it's not substantiated by anything in the record in -- in this long, elaborate TELRIC articulation of -- of numerous standards, both with respect to cost of capital and depreciation because the very next paragraph --",
  "Well, but that says --",
  "Well, it must say that because that's precisely what it said in the statute. Section 47 U.S.C. 252(d)(1), which is replicated on the joint appendix at pages 21 to 23. Congress specifically said now that based upon the cost -- and by the way, it is cost of providing, not cost. It says cost of providing -- parentheses, determined without reference to a rate-of- return or other rate-based proceeding. So, the fact that the FCC put that in its calculation of cost of capital was required by the statute.",
  "Well, you may not, Justice Scalia, but the -- but the cases presented on alternative bases -- the heavy burden that the local exchange carriers must carry here is proving that the embedded cost, historic cost requirement is either in the statute or in the Constitution. We demonstrate in our briefs -- and it's relatively clear that it's not required by the statute, and we submit it's not required by the Constitution either because --",
  "I'm not saying that. I'm saying that ultimately this Court may have to decide whether it gets a fair rate of return for what it is losing, the detriment it gives up when it allows competition to utilize some small portion of their networks under various different, carefully calibrated circumstances. They cannot make that case yet. And by the way, this TELRIC system has been in effect for several years already. It has been applied with depreciation rates. And I was going to point out that there is latitude in the State commissions to set a depreciation rate -- this is in paragraph 703 -- that reflects the true changes in economic value of an asset and a cost of capital that appropriately reflects the risks incurred by an investor, and so forth. Once you've seen the application of that, then you can determine whether or not there's been anything lost. This is -- and Justice Ginsburg's point I have to return to. This is for use in certain markets by certain competitors of certain elements of the incumbent exchange system. If they're interested in recovering whatever the number is of $120 billion or $150 billion worth of embedded costs, are they expected -- do they have a reasonable right to expect that they will recover that out of the -- the fees paid for the elements that are used in a system that is intended to fulfill the congressional goals -- and if these are unconstitutional, that's a separate question, but the congressional goals that the commission was required to dedicate itself to is to promote competition, reduce regulation, lower prices, and encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies. This Court has said over and over again that when the ratemaker --",
  "It -- it -- that's correct. The statute says nothing about compensating investors. It says a just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory rate based upon the -- the various factors of the cost of providing the service. Now, the Eighth Circuit looked at that and said something to the effect that, well, the -- the cost of carrying the extra load with respect to these elements -- that would be an -- something called an incremental cost or a marginal cost. It might be considerably lower. It might reimburse them in some way for some portion of their capital costs. And by the way, Congress does know how to deal with this issue when it -- when it's necessary. In the Pole Attachments Act, which is 47 U.S.C. 224 I think, that the Court considered last week, the -- the statute specifically refers to an allocation for a cost of capital of the telephone pole or the conduit or the right-of-way. It didn't say that in this statute. It said, costs of providing the service. And then it had that exclusion that you mentioned, Justice Scalia, about rate of return, suggesting that the traditional embedded cost rates, to the extent that they are often used in ratemaking, wasn't necessarily what the Congress had in mind. What this Court said in its decision, when it visited this case 4 years ago, is that this statute is in some respects a model of ambiguity, and the Court went -- went on pointedly to say, at the end of that decision, Congress well knows what it's doing when it writes ambiguous provisions. And the word cost, and the word value, and the word rate of return, and things like that in ratemaking cases are ambiguous, and they mean lots of different things under lots of different circumstances. Those ambiguities will be clarified and implemented and filled out by the regulators to whom authority has been given. What happened in this case, I submit, is what Congress properly did. What this Court said in -- I think it was in the Duquesne case -- that these are hopelessly complex calculations that have to go into making rates and deciding what is a fair, just, reasonable, nondiscriminatory rate of return in the ratemaking context. Especially something as complicated as this, especially where you're trying to bring in new competition in a regulated market, especially when you're giving in exchange in part in the statute for allowing competitors to come into the local telephone markets, giving the local telephone companies, which up to that point had been precluded from being in the long distance market and they were being precluded from competing from other local carriers, they were given access to those two markets in exchange, when all of those complexities are taken into consideration, Congress was not going to be -- able to resolve all those things. So, what it did is it turned it over to an expert agency which exists for the very purpose of solving these problems, just like State commissions have the authority. In this case a methodology was developed by the FCC doing exactly what it should have done, listened to the experts, listening to the competing concerns, and the developed a methodology which is forward-looking, which this Court -- Court has never rejected. In fact, in the Duquesne case, in footnote 10 at the very end of the Duquesne case, the Court suggested that that may be an entirely appropriate methodology. In footnote --",
  "Yes.",
  "The problem, Justice --",
  "The problem is --",
  "-- a fair --",
  "It is not taken into account what their embedded costs are with respect to portions of their network that may or may not have anything to do with the provision of the service or the network element involved here. We're talking about loops. We're talking about telephone numbers. We're talking about information used for billing. Whether or not those facilities or those network elements have anything to do with an embedded cost for a plant that was built 30 years ago for X billion dollars is something that's not discernible at the time the statute is written.",
  "Well, I can't determine what those are. I don't know how the telephone companies have been allocating those costs on their books. I suspect that they do not allocate those costs on an element-by-element basis on their books with respect to this thing. At the end of the day --",
  "That has always been the case, and that --",
  "No, Justice Scalia. You said in your concurring opinion in the Duquesne case, we look at -- we look at consequences, not techniques. The balance of the Court said in that case, we look at the impact, not at the methodology. We don't know what the consequences are yet. We don't know what the -- what the impact on the local exchange --",
  "No, I'm not saying that spinning a wheel is okay. What I'm saying is that neither the Constitution nor the statute put prudent investment -- prudent investment rule in this ratemaking statute or the statute that authorized ratemaking and --",
  "Precisely. In fact, that's why I was going to say -- and put in a footnote, which I think is extremely footnote -- footnote 10 said, constitutionalizing the prudent investment rule would foreclose a return to some form of the fair value rule, just as its practical problems may be diminishing. Now, TELRIC is a version of the fair market rule. The emergent -- as the Court went on to say in the Duquesne case, the emergent market for wholesale electric energy could provide a readily available, objective basis for determining the value of utility assets. In other words, the Court was foreseeing in a way the same argument that we were having today. That's why the Court rejected constitutionalizing the prudent investment rule, and that's why the Court signaled that there were other methods that would be available, including fair market methods that -- that might, in fact, be very practical and functional. This is a situation where I -- I -- and I want to emphasize that we're dealing with a statute that didn't require the prudent investment rule. We're dealing with decisions that go -- by this Court that go back 100 years that have said, don't constitutionalize any particular methodology. But that is precisely what the -- the local exchange carriers are arguing for. There are a number of premises in their argument to you --",
  "Well, that -- that's one of the things that I was -- that Mr. Barr said that I think the Court would take issue with. And I think one of the Justices in a question did. I think it may have been you, Justice Scalia. They weren't required to spend the money. They were given an opportunity to invest in an industry, in exchange for which they received a monopoly for a long period of time. Now, the Congress of the United States has decided that we have to have competition, it would be wise to have competition in the local telephone market. They were never promised in any constitutional sense or any contractual sense -- and they don't even allege that, and Mr. Barr said he didn't allege that there was a contract -- that they would recover every nickel of their investments. In the Duquesne case, for example, the argument was made these were reasonable and these were prudent investments in nuclear facilities, and yet the State of Pennsylvania developed a system that did not allow them to recover those prudent investments unless they were actually being used in the delivery of energy products. And the argument was made we have a promise or you have a constitutional obligation or you have some sort of requirement to allow us to recover those costs. The State of -- the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania said no.",
  "They're --",
  "The baseline constitutional standard, at the end of the day, once you can look at the results, is this a non-confiscatory result. Is the lowest -- this Court has said -- it's the Hope Natural Gas case, a number of cases before that, a number of cases after that. It's in the Smyth case. In -- in that the ultimate outcome is a -- the lowest reasonable rate which is the lowest non-confiscatory rate. That is what they are entitled to in the Constitution under the decisions of this Court. Now, what the Court also --",
  "Or the Court -- the Congress might have said, with respect to a transportation company, you had it -- you've had the taxi service all to yourself for all these many years and now we're going to allow other -- some competition in there, and -- and you've got some monopolistic facility, and we're going to let your competitors use some piece of it. Now, you're not going to be -- and -- and we can determine what the value of that is in a competitive market, and we're going to allow you to recover some portion of the value. This Court has repeatedly said under the Fifth Amendment, to the extent that that is applicable -- and I believe it is fundamentally -- to the ratemaking cases and the utility cases -- that it's a fair market value at the time of the taking. Mr. Barr says the taking occurs is -- when we were required to expend the money. Now, that is not when the taking occurs. The taking occurs, if at all, when they have to surrender some portion of their system to allow someone else to use it.",
  "What they wanted to do with the -- they wanted to accomplish a number of goals, which are set forth in the preface of the statute, which I alluded to before, which is to reduce prices, to inspire competition --",
  "Well, they -- they explained that one of the important considerations -- and it's hard to not deal in some generality --",
  "-- this area does. But one of the important objectives that they hoped to achieve was to develop a pricing methodology that would encourage new entrants to come into the market and pay fees that would allow them to enter the market at competitive rates and encourage them to develop new technologies --",
  "Yes, I think that's a fair premise.",
  "Well, it seems to me that they did try to answer that question, Justice Breyer.",
  "All right. But as you pointed out in your -- in your dissent, your partial dissent in the other -- the other time this case was before this Court, there are a variety of different methodologies that various different economists look at and think that they can accomplish those kind of objectives. But this Court has said that we leave that to the regulators to do, and if at the end of the day, there's some level of confiscation, then we can adjudicate that.",
  "All right. Now --",
  "Well, in the first place, we're not talking about replicating an entire firm. We're talking about replicating particular elements that are available to the -- to the firms that wish to interconnect. And the FCC made it clear that we're not talking about -- we're not talking about hypotheticals any more than the embedded cost system would require allocating hypothetical portions of something that happened 30 years ago to a rate for -- for a particular small portion of a product that may have nothing to do with that. What the FCC's order does -- and it explains this in relatively elaborate detail that it's talking about a reasonably available, efficient product in the marketplace that's comparable that can perform a service that's equivalent to the -- the element that may have been built 5 years ago and may be obsolete today or partially obsolete today and may not be efficient. Because if we don't do it that way, we will encourage non-competition or -- or prices that are inefficient based upon old services. And this was actually addressed by Justice Brandeis in the -- in the famous concurring opinion. And he says at the very end of his -- his opinion, he says that -- that surely the cost of an equally efficient substitute must be the maximum of the rate base if prudent investment is to be rejected as a measure. Now, what the FCC did in this case, it made a compromise. It took the wire centers as they existed, and they used the other elements based upon these reasonably efficient, effective, available alternatives. Now, the FCC has been criticized. Well, you're -- you're theoretically inconsistent. You should have done it all this way or all that way. The fact is that this Court has said again and again that the ratemaker may make compromises, may have to balance one benefit to the incumbent with one benefit for the competitors. It may -- it doesn't have to be -- the Duquesne case and I think the Hope case involved challenges of methodological inconsistency, and the Court brushed right past that properly because the ratemakers, to solve this hopelessly complex problem, might have to pick something from column A and column B. Now, at the end of the line, I want to make one important point, that even after the State commissions get finished with the process, the FCC included in its order a provision -- it's paragraph 739 -- that specifically said -- and this is page joint appendix 422. This is after the application of TELRIC and after reasonable depreciation rates are set. And they haven't been -- so they have been set in some places, and they haven't been set in others. And there have been takings -- cases brought by the -- the incumbent carriers. No court, as far as I know, has upheld a taking yet. And costs of capital. There's lots of flexibility. At the end of the day, paragraph 739 says, incumbent local exchange carriers may seek relief from the commission's pricing methodology if they provide specific information to show that the pricing methodology, as applied to them, will result in confiscatory rates. So, TELRIC and the FCC's regulation provided lots of opportunities to get to the end of the day the right result in a manner that achieved these various conflicting goals of Congress. It did it in a way which might not be the best way, although it looks to me like a very conscientious effort to import competition, bring down prices, and to promote technology. But at the end of the day, after the commissions do their job, the expertise that you were talking about in your dissenting opinion -- at the end of the day the incumbent commission -- exchange carriers can come to court and say it was confiscatory, and they have a remedy. Or before that, they may go to the FCC and they have an opportunity to present their case to the FCC. This, it strikes me, is the way it should be done. It may not be perfect. But in this ratemaking area, this is the way it should be done. The expertise was given to the agency that has the expertise, and they were given an opportunity to fulfill the goals of Congress under the constitutional standards set by this Court. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I certainly will. I believe there has been no showing of any bobbing and weaving of any sort on the part of the Government here. What we have, first of all, the Subcontractor Compensation Clause is no longer a part of this case. To the extent that Adarand had standing with respect to it, that provision of the law was declared unconstitutional. The Government has not challenged that provision. That -- there is no evidence in this record that that provision is being used with respect to Adarand at all. With respect to the --",
  "Yes, Justice O'Connor. Now --",
  "Well, if we distinguish between that the Federal aid program and the direct Federal procurement program and the Subcontractor Compensation Clause the United States Government has abandoned in all respects, those provisions have not been justified, and the United States Government is not employing those. With respect to the clauses --",
  "On the basis that -- that they've been determined to be unconstitutional. And the United States is not pursuing that. Now, what -- where the bobbing and weaving has occurred is, as this Court has identified, Adarand has changed its position. It now has decided to challenge the subcontractor clause provisions of the direct procurement actions by the Department of Transportation. But as this Court noted and -- and the Tenth Circuit specifically held, there was no indication that Adarand at the time was challenging those provisions or that Adarand has or will continue to bid for contracts or subcontracts covered by those paragraphs, the race-conscious provisions of those paragraphs.",
  "They were mentioned.",
  "The challenge was to the compensation clause provisions. All of the litigation, up to the point of the reply brief in this Court, had to do with the subcontracting compensation provisions which are not -- no longer in this case. The clause that Adarand now challenges cannot be and is not being applied in the areas in which Adarand does business pursuant to --",
  "The --",
  "It was -- it was mentioned in -- at the beginning of the brief and not addressed -- those provisions were not addressed in the arguments of the brief. But, more importantly, pursuant to the Department of Justice guidelines issued in 1996, those race -- any race-conscious provisions in the statute may not be applied in any area of the country unless they're justified by the Department of Commerce benchmark study that shows a disparity in effect in those districts. The Department of Commerce made its study, and in all but eight States, which do not include Colorado, those measures have been ruled out of bounds, and they're not being applied. And the Department of Transportation has confirmed that.",
  "They're to be conducted every year, but they're not actually being conducted that -- that often.",
  "Well, it's one of those -- one of those Government programs that it is hoped will be conducted more often than they actually get conducted, Chief Justice Rehnquist.",
  "Well, it's conceivable, yes. That's -- that's entirely possible. But there is no evidence that that will occur. There is no evidence that that is likely to occur. That is not usual.",
  "There is no evidence in this record that the subcontract clause provisions, which Adarand is now discussing, have been applied ever in Colorado or in those States precluded by the benchmark study.",
  "Well, and also they are required by the holdings of this Court to apply and interpret that statute in a constitutional fashion. Precisely what this Court discussed in Adarand is to implement whatever programs it has in a narrowly tailored fashion. What the Department of Justice did, after this decision in Adarand, is enter into a lengthy study, determined that race-conscious programs or provisions of Federal statutes could not be applied in ways that were not narrowly tailored, responding directly to this Court's guidance. As a result of that, the Department of Justice study indicated that they would only be applied -- only -- even at the outset -- in areas where there was evidence of the direct effects of discrimination in Federal contracting. The Department of Commerce thereafter conducted a study, did not find these disparate impact in terms of effects of discrimination in the areas in which Colorado exists. In fact, in 42 -- 42 States. And as a result of that, the Department of Transportation has not used and has not employed the -- the race-conscious provisions of those clauses in those areas.",
  "Yes.",
  "They are in the contract forms, but the Department -- that is again another carryover of instances where they probably should be removed from the contract forms, but they're not being implemented or enforced to impose any race-conscious remedy --",
  "Well --",
  "Well, he -- well, in the first place, the three contracts that were mentioned in the reply brief -- Adarand was not the high bidder in those three contracts. And Adarand has not alleged --",
  "I mean the low bidder. Excuse me. In fact, in the submission that it -- that it put before the Court --",
  "Well, he has got to demonstrate -- as I understand this Court's holdings with respect to standing, he's got to show some immediate impact or the potential for actual harm. Now, what is -- the Department of Justice has said race-conscious remedies will not be applied in these areas. The Department of Commerce has delineated the areas. The Department of Transportation has again, on August 24th as submitted to this Court, made it absolutely specific that it is the policy of the Federal Highway Administration that separate percentage goals shall only be required in those areas where the --",
  "Yes.",
  "This case --",
  "Well, no, no. What the Government has said in this August 24 memorandum is entirely consistent with what the Department of Justice guidelines require and what the Department of Justice and -- and the Department of Transportation has been saying all along. To the extent that those provisions appear in the contract, this -- this document, that was issued on August 24, says contracting officers shall disregard those goals in --",
  "Justice --",
  "The -- the Department of Transportation and the Department of Justice have consistently adhered to the provision that those race- conscious provisions will not be enforced in the direct procurement program in these areas. And there's no evidence that they ever have been.",
  "Yes, they have, and they reaffirmed --",
  "Well, this -- this memorandum --",
  "Well, Justice Scalia, it strikes me -- and I -- I respectfully submit that -- that you're switching it around. It seems to me that Adarand has the responsibility to suggest or demonstrate to this Court that it's actually being hurt or that there is some evidence that -- that race-conscious decisions are being made in the contracting process. And Adarand has not demonstrated, with respect to even the three contracts it mentioned, that it was the low bidder.",
  "Well, I -- I wouldn't contradict that, but I would say when the Government has made it absolutely clear that it is not enforcing race-conscious remedies, as instructed by this Court in the first Adarand decision, except in a narrowly tailored fashion, and there's been subsequent legislation of a compelling need, but that that response to that compelling need has been narrowed down to the areas where it is necessary and --",
  "The provision was not removed in some of those contracts, and I -- I can't tell this Court how many. But it is -- it is explicitly clear and there is no evidence to contradict that they're not being -- those race-conscious provisions are not being enforced with respect --",
  "If they were being enforced and Adarand could suggest that it was somehow affected by that. And it has not been able to do that either because with respect to the three contracts, its own lodging -- and I would refer the Court in part to C1 of tab M in the yellow -- the first volume of the yellow submission, which is a sheet in which -- this is the Adarand submission. And tab M refers to one of those contracts, just as an example. And it says in that document -- this is an Adarand document -- who was awarded the work we bid? And then it circles the company who was awarded the bid. If not us, why not? And it's scribbled in here from Adarand, we were not high -- we were high. Excuse me.",
  "They were the high bidder and therefore they didn't get the contract because they were -- were not the low bidder. And that's true if -- it takes a little bit of combing through the record, but it's demonstrably true with respect to those other two contracts as well.",
  "It's -- it's -- well, Justice Scalia, it has been the documented, articulated policy of the -- since the Department of Justice study. The guidelines went out to all Federal agencies not to employ these programs, except under certain conditions. The Commerce Department implemented that decision, and there's no evidence to the contrary.",
  "Well, if you look at the Government's --",
  "No. But the -- what there is is a Department of Justice requirement imposed upon all Federal agencies not to employ race-conscious remedies in those areas --",
  "That was in 1996.",
  "Well, it -- well, the memorandum in August of -- of 2001 reiterates the policy that the Department of Transportation had been operating under.",
  "I don't agree with you. I -- I --",
  "I can't -- I can't give you cite to the record, but the -- the Department of Justice memoranda is in the Government's appendix. It's a -- it's a lengthy document, and it makes it clear that race-conscious remedies cannot be used except in those areas subject to the Department of Commerce benchmark study.",
  "It would not have applied in 1989 when this case first arose. The -- that's -- that's a very good point, Justice Souter. When this case first arose, Mountain Gravel was not -- was a small business enterprise itself. At the appendix to the Government's brief at pages 202 to 203 to 204, the actual contract is listed. The box is checked, are you a small business enterprise. That's checked. And then on the page which contains the subcontractor -- subcontracting clause itself, the language in there specifically says, this shall not apply to small business concerns. Now --",
  "Well, as I say, they were not the low bidder on that contract. They weren't disadvantaged --",
  "-- by that contracting situation.",
  "Well, all I can say is that the Government has announced its policy, and there's no evidence in the record that it's acted inconsistently with any application of race-conscious remedies in the area in which Adarand --",
  "This --",
  "Well, I think it's very important to emphasize that this is a facial challenge to the statute and to the system. And this Court has consistently said that unless there are no set of circumstances under which the regulation and the statute could be enforced on a constitutional matter -- that's the Salerno case.",
  "I -- I respectfully disagree with respect to whether Adarand was adversely affected by the program. They have not demonstrated that they lost a single contract as a result of -- of the provisions which they're -- which they've decided now to challenge.",
  "Yes, and they were affected by -- we're not contending that they did not have standing to challenge that subcontracting compensation provision.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Yes, and -- and to the extent that -- that the program, as it exists, requires people to -- in order to be designated as a disadvantaged business enterprise, must file certificates articulating that they have been the victim of a social and economic disadvantage.",
  "Well, it's defined in the statute.",
  "Well, it's --",
  "It's -- it's explained in the statute both with respect to ethnic and racial prejudice because of their identity as a group without regard to individual qualities, and that economic disadvantage -- the ability to compete in the free enterprise system has diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the same business area --",
  "Both -- well, that's a social -- the use of the term in the statute described a victim of -- of prejudice or bias, and that has had economic effect on the individual. Both of those points are required. The regulations themselves --",
  "No. That -- that form is a --",
  "That is not the right form. There is a -- that's a -- that's a part of a notice of proposed rulemaking. That form has never been adopted . I'm -- I'm reasonably confident that it never will be adopted. The -- the regulations which explain in further detail social and economic disadvantage are contained --",
  "The forms -- the different States use different forms. There's no uniform form. But the regulations explain --",
  "But that is --",
  "But the -- but the -- but that has to be looked at in terms of the -- what the statute defines as social and economic disadvantage and what the regulations, which are in -- at pages 70 to 72a of the Government's appendix, which define -- which -- which are the regulation -- Department of Transportation regulations. And it's a -- it's a rebuttable and challengeable position, Justice Scalia. It has to be signed before a notary. The agency --",
  "Any adversely affected party can rebut it. The State may challenge it. In fact --",
  "Well, what you have to show to be entitled to certification, according to the regulations, is substantial and chronic social disadvantage in the business world and that -- and that credit has been impaired due to diminished capital or opportunities have been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities, as compared to others in the same or similar line of business. I submit --",
  "Social -- social disadvantage, Justice Scalia, is defined in the statute as having been a victim of racial or -- or prejudice of that nature, and that it has produced economic disadvantage based upon --",
  "Well, I believe that we're correct.",
  "Once you -- once you --",
  "And I hope I said it persuasively.",
  "I think the regulations are relatively clear. Once you've reached a certain plateau of economic category, you're out. And these -- these certifications are -- again, the regulations explain the State must conduct a relatively careful investigation of applications for certification. In fact, I understand -- it's not in the record, but I understand in the last 12 months in Colorado, out of 160 applications, only 65 or --",
  "That's correct. That's our position. And I -- and I don't -- well, that is our position. I don't understand the analysis that would come out the other way because I think the statute is relatively clear with respect to that. The -- the -- so, the -- in the first place, the certification process requires someone asserting under oath, because that -- that affidavit requirement is there, that subject to challenge -- Adarand itself said in its cert petition in the most recent case before this one that it was not prepared to sign a certification about social and economic disadvantage because it was afraid of being prosecuted for fraud, perjury, and disbarment charges and things of that -- that sort. So, there's plenty of evidence that people take these things seriously, that the statutory threshold and the regulatory threshold must be met. It may be challenged by people. There are field procedures in place and so forth. So, that's another step of the narrow tailoring requirement that takes place with respect to this process. So, we submit that with respect to the subject of a compelling governmental interest, this Court addressed that very point in its first Adarand decision, and -- and made it clear in the last paragraph of part 3(d) of that opinion that the unhappy persistence of both the practice and lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country is an unfortunate reality.",
  "Well, in the first place, there's about 30-some years of study by Congress of disadvantage and discrimination, which this Court recognized in Fullilove and in Croson and in Adarand, that is taking place in the contracting industry. Those -- those categories --",
  "People -- people of a certain racial background and a certain color are discriminated against and those --",
  "Well, I -- I submit that when you -- if you were to describe different people of different national backgrounds or racial backgrounds that have been guilty of discrimination, they may fall in any of those categories. They may come from a certain country in Africa or -- or a certain country in Southeast Asia or a certain Hispanic community. That doesn't change the fact that what the racial discrimination is has been on the basis of the characteristics of skin and nationality, of which those are simply subgroups.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, what -- what the Congress said over and over again, on the basis of detailed analytical studies which are -- which are described in considerable detail in the -- in the court of appeals opinion, and what this Court has said is that there has been the lingering effects, unfortunately, of publicly financed discrimination in the construction industry. What you're referring to, Justice Scalia, is an effort by the Government. Now, we have all three branches of Government recognizing a significant, serious problem that Government has a responsibility to address. What the -- what the executive branch did with respect to the regulations in its programs is put a number of measures in to attempt to meet the very points that this Court suggested that are ways to narrowly tailor the remedy, which is certainly something that the Government has a responsibility to do, to make sure that only individuals that fall into cases where there's actual -- actually been discrimination are the beneficiaries and limits on the program to make sure that it does not go to a broader area or longer temporally than it should. I submit that what we have here is the executive branch attempting to respond to a legitimate serious problem that all three branches of Government have been concerned about in a highly responsible way. And in the face of a facial challenge, it cannot be said that there are not ways that this -- these regulations can be implemented in a constitutional fashion. And therefore, to the extent that there is a facial challenge, the petitioner has not met, by any stretch of the imagination, its burden. If anything, this case should be dismissed as improvidently granted, but if the Court rules on the merits, these programs are constitutional against a facial challenge.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: All three branches of our National Government have repeatedly determined that pornography causes substantial, incalculable damage to our children, that assisting parents in protecting children from that damage is a compelling national interest, and that pornography is widely available and readily accessible to our children on the Internet. The Child Online Protection Act is Congress' response to that urgent national problem. It was drafted after testimony, hearings, and findings in direct response to explicit and detailed guidance in this Court's 1993 Reno v. ACLU decision explaining how to solve the problem of Internet pornography in a constitutional manner. COPA directly responds to several of the Court's explicit suggestions in its 1997 Reno v. ACLU decision. In the first place, Congress gave explicit, substantive meaning to the terms, harmful to minor, utilizing standards developed over several decades by this Court describing what would be prohibited in the terms used by this Court in the context of minors. I will not get into the specifics of that, because those are before the Court, and the Court is quite familiar with them. The Court also added, however, in response to this Court's explicit suggestion, the third prong of the so-called Ginsberg-Miller test, that the material taken as a whole would have to lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors, an objective standard developed by this Court to protect the producers of communications. Congress limited the statute to commercial pornographers at this Court's suggestion, those whose trade or business, in an effort to produce profits, are engaged regularly in the production of explicit sexual material for profit.",
  "Well, as -- the reference to community standards in the statute is in the first and second and prongs of a three-part test. This Court has introduced that community standard provision to protect the communicator from individualized determinations by jurors, and from particularly sensitive, or particularly insensitive communities. The Court has explained again and again that it is an average standard. It is an adult approach to what might be prohibited from the standpoint of damage to minors. The Court has repeatedly said that it might be -- it doesn't refer to any specific geographic limitation. In fact, in the Hamling case and in the Jenkins case decided by this Court several years ago, the Court made it clear that the community standards prong does not have to apply to any specific community.",
  "Well, this Court has repeatedly said -- for example, in the Hamling case the Court was looking at a geographic standard that covered the entire State of California. The Court said in Hamling and Jenkins that the standard doesn't have to have any specific geographic limitation.",
  "Well, yes, because the Court was in that case applying the two -- the other two prongs that this Court --",
  "It wasn't in the definition in the statute itself. It was what this Court read into --",
  "Well, it may be, but what the Congress was attempting to do was to develop and put into the statute the protections which this Court over the years have said are very important to protect the communicator.",
  "Well, what this Court has decided is that something to prevent jurors from deciding -- imposing their own individual standards, or imposing the least sensitive standards of the community, or the most sensitive standards of the community.",
  "Well, there is two parts to that. The serious value standard is an objective standard that this Court and other courts are entitled to examine closely, and have examined closely to make sure that there aren't any aberrational prosecutions or limits imposed. With respect to the community standards, what the Congress was attempting to do was to make sure that people didn't impose individual limitations with respect to how they were judging the material with respect to the other two prongs of the statute. I hope I have answered your question, but --",
  "That was a finding, so to speak, by the House committee that there is not with respect -- years have changed since the Miller and the Hamling case. We're now in an era of national television, national media -- some of those standards were articulated at a time when the community of the United States was much more isolated and insular in various different parts. We are now talking about a national media, national television, national communication, the Internet reaching millions and millions of households. What Congress felt, that there would not be substantial variation between what the average adult would feel would be harmful to minors under the very specific, itemized, detailed standards, prong 1, prong 2, and then with the value-added prong 3 --",
  "Well, the House report that specifically talked about that did not explain. I should hasten to -- did not explain what the individual elected Members of Congress were thinking when they came to those conclusions. I think it's a reasonable thing to conclude, is that Members of Congress are reflecting the judgments that they develop as a result of running for office and being in a national legislature. That's exactly what we expect Congress to do, and what Congress did in this case was apply those standards, and those instincts, and those judgments in a way in which it was in every conscientious way attempting to comply with the instruction that came from this Court in Reno v. ACLU as to how to do it.",
  "Well, the courts have permitted expert testimony with respect to that, but there's a great deal of supervision that the trial courts and the appellate courts impose with respect to that to make sure that these definitions are being applied in a nonaberrational --",
  "I would submit, Justice Kennedy, that yes, that would be possible. The Hamling instruction I think is instructive. The Hamling instruction was the standards generally held throughout this country concerning sex, and matters pertaining to sex, the average conscience of the time, the present critical point in the compromise between candor and shame at which the community may have arrived at here and now. In other words, that standard -- and the defendant in that case argued to this Court that that is a national standard which this Court in Miller said was not required as a matter of the First Amendment. Interestingly, in Hamling, the defendants in that case argued just as the plaintiffs in this case do, that a national standard is both required and would be prohibited. In other words, they want to have it both ways.",
  "They want to have it neither way. Either way, it would be unconstitutional, and this Court has specifically addressed that by saying that it -- that jurors are allowed to draw from their experience, which necessarily comes from the community in which they reside, but that Congress felt in this case that there would be relatively constant standards throughout the country. This is a facial challenge.",
  "There's no evidence --",
  "I think that this Court has said that that is not a requirement of the First Amendment, but from the --",
  "Yes, sir.",
  "I think I would, Justice Breyer, and I think --",
  "And I think that would be a -- the statute is readily -- to use the words of this Court, the statute is readily susceptible to the narrowing construction, if that's how you would regard that, or a leveling construction. I --",
  "I don't think so. I think that what Justice Breyer is suggesting is a jury instruction or a judicial construction which would apply to prongs 1 and 2, and that what you're saying is absolutely correct also, we submit, that that is precisely what this Court has said that third prong is there for. I should --",
  "Well then, I agree with your construction of what I'm saying.",
  "I think it's a very important point to make, that the Court has said that that is another way in which we protect the speaker from aberrational, highly --",
  "Well, I suspect, Justice Stevens, that the people who assisted the Members of Congress in drafting the statute read this Court's decisions, as there's every indication in the two committee reports and in the hearings that were taken, that the Court was attempting in every way to live up to the standards of this Court. This Court was saying that the First Amendment does not require a national standard with respect to community standards, but this Court has not been entirely --",
  "Well, what I think -- no, I don't necessarily think that the Court -- that the Congress was intending to impose a national standard, because this Court had said that it wasn't required under the First Amendment, and that the community standards did not have to be judged by any particular geographical area.",
  "Well, I think what Congress was attempting to do was come as close as possible to adopting what this Court had said in the context of obscenity. Now, I should hasten to say that to the extent that the Third Circuit felt that the community standards makes it unconstitutional in the context of the Internet, that -- those community standards are -- this statute prohibits obscene material on the Internet, too, and community standards don't work for material which is harmful to minors. They don't work probably for obscenity, either.",
  "Well, yes, Justice --",
  "Well, I would submit that the judge would instruct the jury, and the judge examining the decision of the jury afterwards in appellate courts would do exactly what this Court has said. As long as the juror is attempting to apply his judgment or her judgment with respect to adult perceptions, based upon all the input that the juror may have with respect to what is generally harmful to minors -- the dilemma that this has caused, causes here, both for Congress and here in this Court, is that we want on the one hand to make sure that idiosyncratic judgments are not being imposed on the transmitter of information. On the other hand, we don't want such wide variations that there would be difference in community --",
  "I think the defendants can put on expert testimony with respect to what general standards are, to use the phrase in Hamling, country-wide. Now, I should say --",
  "I'm not objecting to that. If that is the readily accessible --",
  "I think that is a reasonable solution to the problem, and is consistent with what Congress was saying. Congress was also aware that this Court has said over and over again that the same material may be judged differently by different juries from place to place, and that that is not a constitutional impediment. This Court has also said --",
  "Yes. That's what this Court has said again and again, and we of course accept that, and that is -- Congress accepted that as well.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, that's right, but remember that -- it seems important to emphasize that these definitions are highly specific with respect to the material which is prohibited. It's not just saying to jurors -- the obscenity statute doesn't have any of these limitations in it. 18 U.S.C. 466 just talks in very, very general terms, so what Congress was trying to do here is be much more specific than the obscenity statute, which this Court has accepted for 30 or 40 years by importing these kinds of definitions into it. What Congress felt it was doing responsively was not only defining what was prohibited very specifically, but then incorporating those specific standards, just as you suggest, Justice Ginsburg. The other thing that this Court has said is that those who are choosing a medium to make available to children material which is harmful to children, over which the person who is disseminating that information, those who wantonly decide to pollute the stream from which we all drink have a responsibility to take the minimal steps necessary to reduce the harm that's being caused by putting that material into the stream. What we have as a result of this are substantive standards that Congress developed based upon the teachings of this Court with respect to obscenity, applying those standards to minors, as this Court suggested is appropriate and a part of a compelling national interest in the Ginsberg case, the Ferber case, and Sable case, and other cases where the Court has suggested that something has to be done, and is entirely appropriate to be done with respect to minors. And then the third thing that Congress did was adopt a solution to the problem which is consistent with what 48 or so States have in these blinder laws, magazine racks displays, the books, materials that this Court considered in the American Booksellers case with respect to what would be permissible to prevent children from seeing damaging materials in bookstores. Now, that is -- so what we have as a result of COPA, Congress listening to this Court, lowering the age to 16 and under, making it apply to commercial speech and noncommercial speech, returning parental control, adopting a device that this Court has considered in the Sable case and considered in this case. The language of this Court's decision in Reno v. ACLU said that the age verification system is technologically and economically feasible, is already in use, and would provide a defense to those commercial purveyors of pornography, so Congress listened to that, adopted that system, put into place for the Internet the same standard that already exists in the 48- State blinder laws with respect to access of minors to these materials, so --",
  "Well, the Congress did explicitly consider that. COPA applied to material in interstate or foreign commerce. The Government will prosecute where it can material that comes in from abroad where it's capable of doing it, but Congress also recognized that it would not -- was not going to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. It was going to deal with those problems, or those portions of the problem that it could address. Now, we understand and we have acknowledged that it may well be that there are circumstances under which these limitations can be avoided. There may be certain foreign purveyors that Government are not able to track down or obtain jurisdiction over, but what Congress was trying to do is deal with as much of the problem as it could in as constitutional a manner as possible.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, I think -- and the Court considered a case earlier this year of the damage that that industry does, earlier this term. Yes, there's two parts to that, Justice Scalia, the damage of the industry, the domestic industry itself is incalculable, but the damage to the recipient, to the children, are also incalculable, so that might address part of the problem, but Congress in this --",
  "Yes. We're not talking about that aspect of the issue that you're considering in that other case, but what I was simply trying to address is Justice Scalia's question, that this is a major problem. We understand from the legislative history that explicit, adult material, not just on the Internet, is an $8 billion industry. According to what Congress decided in this case, there are 28,000 sexually explicit commercial pornography sites on the Internet. This is readily accessible to children. It is almost -- anyone with any experience with the Internet will tell you that children can find it readily, and find it as long as they can type and read they will find it, and will find it by accident, and once they find it by accident -- the House committee points out that if you type in the words, White House, www.whitehouse.com, you will find offensive, explicit pornography, and it's very hard to get rid of.",
  "Possibly.",
  "Well, one of the ones that we were concerned about is a series of very explicit pictures, and I think the Court knows which ones I'm talking about. We -- I went and did some additional research on that. That is -- that are photographs of an art exhibit, and one art gallery that was several years ago that is a small portion of a large compilation. Justice Ginsburg, I think that -- I don't know how that would come out when all of the evidence came in with respect to that. Those photographs were pulled out of context and put in the exhibits. That's why this material has to be looked at as a whole, under these specific standards. I'd like to reserve the remaining part of my time for rebuttal, except to say that this is a facial challenge, and we are dealing with the possibility of striking down or not allowing the enforcement of a statute which we -- this Court and Congress and the executive branch is a necessary, narrowly tailored, carefully crafted solution to a desperate problem.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Ginsburg, this Court has specifically said and held in the Ginsberg case that the Government does have a responsibility, and this Court has repeatedly said there's a compelling national interest in addressing that responsibility. It is not just helping the parents. It's an independent, as this Court put it in the Ginsberg case, independent responsibility to do something to prevent damage, which everybody agrees is damage to children. What we're hearing from the plaintiffs in this case is the same sky is falling defense that everything possible is going to be precluded and taken away from adults, and that some of the same parties were making in the American Booksellers case, and this Court sent that back to Virginia and asked the Virginia court to examine whether all of these publications and materials were going to be covered by the statute, and it turned out that none of them were, and then the case wended its way back to the Fourth Circuit, and it resolved itself in these statutes that were used, that Congress uses as an analogy, the blinder statute. Now, what our opponents say now is that this blinder statute applied to the Internet is somehow intrusive, expensive, intolerable, burdensome. But when you go into a bookstore to look behind the rack, you have to do that in person. Sometimes, if it's a 7-11 or one of these convenience stores, it may be on a camera. In the Internet, you have to identify yourself with a credit card, which many people do anyway. These screens already exist, as Justice Stevens' questions focus on. It is the teasers that are in front of the screen that Congress was attempting to get at, so in many cases these screens already exist. There's a privacy provision built into the statute that prevents the adult identification services from sharing the information as to the identity of the person using it. I would submit, or the Government would submit it's quite obvious that this is less intrusive. As this Court said in Reno v. ACLU, the system already exists, and it's already in use, so what -- and the definitions -- oh, and the other point that several of the questions have focused on is if community standards are not permissible on the Internet, which is what I understand our opponent's position to be, those go out the window with respect to obscenity, because those are the same standards that this Court developed. Now, what will happen then, as a result of affirming the Third Circuit's decision, is that all of the obscene material which is now behind the screen will be in front of the screen, and all these children will now not just be seeing the teasers, but the effect of the Third Circuit decision is that they will be seeing everything that anybody, any of the commercial pornographers want to put on the Internet. Now, the definition of commercial, that is the same definition. Congress understands what those words mean. It made it clear that it was talking about people that are in the business of making a profit as a regular trade or business in dealing with the provision of material which is sexually explicit, and damaging to minors. It's a definition that already exists, that this Court is quite familiar with. It's in 18 U.S.C. 1466, the obscenity statute. The same definition of commercial is in that statute that Congress adopted for this statute. Finally, with respect to the national standards point, I don't think Congress intended to adopt a national standard. I think what they were trying to do is develop a standard based upon what this Court said in Hamling, and specifically in Jenkins, which was decided the same day as Hamling. The jury instructions need not specify what community, and so forth. I won't repeat the whole definition there, that the definition of community standards does not have to be geographically limited. Congress suggested that there wasn't going to be much variation. They didn't -- Congress didn't feel that there would be much variation anyway, and this Court has said there can be some variations from place to place and time to time --",
  "-- and if you're in that business you're taking your chances.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The colloquy so far today seems to me to illustrate the wisdom of Justice O'Connor's comment in her concurring opinion in the Palazzolo case last June that the Court should avoid per se rules in the area of regulatory taking. Petitioners knew per se rule of takings jurisprudence, taken to its logical end, would make every freeze in the status quo, however brief, during a permitting, planning, or rezoning process equivalent to a condemnation, to use their words --",
  "It seems to me that's a very difficult distinction for him to make, because it requires an analysis of the nature of the Government's interest in each particular permitting process. We know that they can be short, we know that they can be long, we know that they can be comprehensive.",
  "Well, what we would submit is that that zoning permitting process is part of the background principles of land use, land regulation, just as temporary moratoria have always been, that when there's rezoning process, a process referred to by this court in the First English case, that process may have to come to a halt. The purpose for the temporary moratoria here was to allow the agency to develop a sensible plan and, as Mr. Roberts has already noted by reference to the record, there's no indication that it was not in good faith. The length of the period, 32 months, was held by the district court to be a reasonable time to accomplish the objectives. The purpose of the plan, as acknowledged by the petitioners themselves, is that the purpose for the plan was to prevent the degradation of the lake and they indicated that a slowdown -- in their brief, they mentioned in their brief that a slowdown in building permits was an appropriate governmental response to that measure. Now, in each instance the question is going to be, how long did it take, was it in good faith, what was the Government up to? Here, the Government was attempting to preserve the value that Mr. Berger's clients wanted. They themselves purchased their property and planned to build a home on it because of the pristine quality of the lake. They make the argument in their brief that it was being degraded, that something had to be done about it. A limit on development they say -- I think it's on page 3 of their brief -- was the logical objective to solve, approach to solve that particular problem. So what Lake Tahoe, the regional board that we're dealing with here today, was doing was saying, wait a minute, before we destroy the lake let's stop, let's have a process in which we evaluate how to solve the problem that every landowner around the lake, including the petitioners, want to have solved.",
  "It may be unusual, but it is not so rare. In fact, page 5 of the petitioners' brief refers to the two --",
  "Two instances, and the first one that they refer to is to aid the preparation of a comprehensive plan by precluding developers from obtaining permits that conflict with the plan being drafted. That is precisely almost the same words that were used by the legislator in connection with the compact that suggested that there ought to be a moratorium. This is the compact itself in the 1980 amendments. It specifically said that it was necessary temporarily to halt works of development in the region which might otherwise absorb the entire capability of the region for further development or direct it out of harmony with the ultimate plan. Now, if there is some challenge to the good faith of what was going on here, that is not this case. If there's some challenge to what happened afterwards -- I think the questions Justice Stevens asked point out that, well, if there was something that was done improperly to take these people's property with respect to what happened afterwards, or how far it went, or how it affected a particular property owner, that is the Penn Central test. Now, for tactical reasons, the property owners in this case decided not to pursue a Penn Central case. We heard here today that because it would be too expensive and too complicated for any individual property owner to bring that case. Well, that is going to be the case every time anybody challenges Government action as a taking of a piece of property. These property owners decided to pool their interest and decide not to show what the Government's interest was, the degree of invasion in individual property rights, how much it hurt, whether or not it was in good faith and so forth, so they eschewed tactically all of those considerations. Now, instead --",
  "They couldn't use their property at all as far as this case was concerned, and the question presented in this case, for a limited period of time while a Government agency was acting to address the problem that they acknowledge, because they acknowledge that continued development along the lines that was occurring at the time this moratorium was adopted was degrading the lake and destroying their property.",
  "Well --",
  "I submit it's the teaching of this Court that not every delay, not every intrusion on the use of property, not every incursion on property rights constitutes a taking under the Fifth Amendment.",
  "Well, Justice --",
  "Well --",
  "They haven't established that they have bore the whole brunt. They haven't established the degree to which their individual property rights were violated, or the extent of their intrusion. They haven't done all of the things that this Court --",
  "Because the use of that property, as they acknowledge, would have destroyed the very property rights that they're here seeking to vindicate, and what we're saying is that in many different situations the Government might have lots of reasons, local governments, State governments, Federal Governments, to cause a pause in the development. Now, what --",
  "That's right, and --",
  "And that's why this Court in the Penn Central case gave an opportunity to use a reasoned decisionmaking to solve the problem, to find out how far is too far. To ask that very question that Justice Holmes did is to entertain the answer. We need to know how -- in order to determine how far is too far, this Court has said repeatedly we need to look at the circumstances. What -- the rule that petitioners are proposing interdicts that judicial fact-finding, reasoned decisionmaking process. What it also does is cause the permitting agency, the Lake Tahoe Regional Planning Board, to try to do this on a permit-by-permit, quasi- adjudicative process, as opposed to what they did do, as instructed by Congress, a legislative process in which things would stop, reasoned decisionmaking would take place --",
  "Well, I understand that, Mr. Chief Justice, but what I'm saying is that the Government agencies that looked at this problem decided that it had to be solved in a global way. This was Government acting in a way we want it to act, in a legislative process with transparency to look at the whole problem and, if there had been a taking because it was too long, or too much of an intrusion, there is a remedy under the Fifth Amendment and it's described, how you get to that remedy is described in this Court's jurisprudence in the Penn Central case. The petitioners here sought not to pursue that remedy.",
  "A taking -- well, a curfew --",
  "Well, I think that they're arguing that any momentary suspension of the use of property would be a taking.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to follow up on the point that was just being made. This Court has taught repeatedly that the history, the context, and the purpose for programs like this are a very, very important part of the determination of what the endorsement test or the effects test would be. There is no question that the purpose that inspired, and the history and the context that inspired the Ohio pilot program could not have been more compelling and more focused on the needs of children.",
  "Well, perhaps, Justice Stevens, I might, but this -- as this Court has taught repeatedly, the background history and the context informs the decision which this Court has endorsed with respect to what the effects or endorsement test would be, measured by what a reasonable, objective observer would believe the State or the Government was doing, is the Government endorsing religion, and that has to be considered in the context of what was going on. Here we have a manifestly failing system in which -- no one disagrees with that. Efforts had been made, and a Federal court had decided the system had to be taken over.",
  "I would invite the Court's attention to page 41 of the Taylor petitioner's brief, which contains a chart which shows the various choices which were made available to the students as a result of the composite, the context of the program that we're considering. It shows -- that chart shows, along with the other statistics in the brief, that there are 57,000 students in the school system. 16,000 went to the magnet schools, 2,000-and-some are going into the community schools -- these are present facts -- 3,700 accepted scholarships to use in religiously affiliated schools, 1,400 accepted the tutorial program, and another 100-and- so took scholarships with respect to nonreligiously affiliated schools.l There were more nonreligiously affiliated schools available, but two of those, the major ones, decided to become community schools. I would like to invite the Court's attention --",
  "No. I -- what I meant --",
  "I stand corrected. What I mean to say, the choices were -- there was a broad range of choices, but the program itself was made available to all of the students.",
  "That's correct, and the record is quite clear on this, also. Any student who wanted to go to a nonreligiously affiliated private school, no student who wanted to do that was declined the opportunity to do that, so your child, Justice Breyer, could have gone to a nonreligiously affiliated school.",
  "Well, I think that's an impression that you may have, but --",
  "No, no. There's no record evidence to support that. Remember, this is a pilot program, an experimental program. The best evidence may be found in the affidavit or declaration of Howard Fuller, who was the former superintendent of the Milwaukee system, who watched the Milwaukee system develop and get put into practice. That's at the joint appendix pages 228 to 236. During the period of time that the Milwaukee program has been in existence, the number of private, nonreligiously affiliated schools have increased from 7 to 30, the number of students in those private, nonreligiously affiliated schools has increased tenfold, from 337 to 3,025. He also points out that the existence of the alternative has improved the public school systems as well. Parents are involved in the choice of the educational opportunities for their children. He demonstrates they get more involved in the school system.",
  "Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, absolutely, but the record here goes even further than that, because the record that is available shows these many alternatives. It shows that when the program has been allowed to exist free of constitutional objection, it has shown improvement at the student level, and improvement at the public school level as well as the private school level. Let me emphasize that in response to the question Justice Souter raised at the very beginning of the argument, it isn't just neutrality, but there is clearly neutral criteria here for opting in or out of the program. Another factor that the Court has thought was important in the past was, the parents have an option not to participate in the program, and that's a part of the optional choices that are available.",
  "Yes, Justice O'Connor, I believe that is the correct context.",
  "I think the court made a legal error in failing to do so, because this Court has taught over and over again that the context is extremely important --",
  "It affects both the amount of money to be given and the preference. To the extent that there are any limitations on the program at all, the priorities are given to low income students on the theory --",
  "Well, that's always the case, of course --",
  "-- in any Government program, but the priorities are given to the low income people. The evidence that's in the record demonstrates that the vast majority of these scholarships are used by people at the poverty level. The rationale for that, of course, was that people in the higher income level can afford the alternative.",
  "That's correct, Justice O'Connor, but the Court has made the point in connection with those types of programs that there's a significant difference between a direct aid program, where funds are going from the Government to the school, as opposed to the private, genuinely independent, purely private choice programs where the choices are being made by individual parents, and being made by individual parents motivated by the best education for their children. So to go back to the reasonable observer test with respect to endorsement, would a reasonable observer believe that the Government's putting its thumb in favor of religion on the scales here under all of these circumstances, the wide range of choices --",
  "I think applying the standards this Court has adopted, that if the criteria are neutral -- and I'm answering -- I'm saying yes.",
  "Which we're also offer -- yes. Yes.",
  "I think if there was a purely neutral criteria in terms of eligibility for the program, and it's a purely private choice, that the -- because this Court has emphasized that we're looking at whether the Government's being -- going to be perceived by a reasonable observer as endorsing religion, if it is a purely private choice program, the teaching of this Court is, it's not unlike a Government check that goes to an individual who then spends it, all of it on his church.",
  "It's purely neutral --",
  "Well, I would probably be making that argument in another case. I don't have to make that argument here, because we have all of these other alternatives, including private schools.",
  "Well, I think that what this Court has taught, that because these establishment Clause cases are so difficult, that they are made in the context of the particular facts of the case, and that the facts and circumstances in history illuminate what the Government was involved in, because we're not talking about --",
  "Well --",
  "That was the same factor in the Mueller case, and one of the other cases that has been cited, the Court said that is not of constitutional significance. We're not going to --",
  "Because those choices this Court has said are the result of purely private choices, and that that will not be associated by a reasonable observer with a governmental decision.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 5 years ago in its Glucksberg decision, the Court urged utmost care in creating new substantive due process rights because doing so removes the matter from the arena of public debate and legislative action. That admonition is acutely compelling in the field of Government-to-citizen communication. Respondent's theory would not only constitutionalize the Freedom of Information Act and create a constitutional pre-litigation discovery right against the Government, but would also affirmatively discourage an unquantifiable, but immense volume of valuable informal Government communications that take place thousands of times every day. As the Court held in OPM v. Richmond in 1990, the natural consequence of a rule imposing liability for Government statements would be a decision to cut back and impose strict controls upon Government provision of information. Government officials respond to informal requests for information every day in -- in an infinite variety of contexts with infinite -- with an infinite array of answers, candor, off-the-record disclosures, and occasional polite evasions. One of the most commonplace of those governmental responses to requests for information is the equivocal and innocuous I will get back to you that forms the core of respondent's constitutional theory. Today, the respondent urges that that I will get back to you, when accompanied by an easy to allege and hard to disprove, in the words of this Court, allegation that such responses were intentionally false for the purpose of discouraging a potentially productive litigation will become the trigger for expensive, burdensome, and distracting personal suits for damages against the offending officials. The -- the consequence will be a drying up of informal Government-to-citizen exchanges and a regime of no comment or brush-offs or brusk refusals to discuss, the precise antithesis of the open Government the Framers of the First Amendment intended. So, to constitutionalize the responses in an informal context where the response was not required by any provision of law, no response was required at all, the response violated no law or affirmative duty to respond, it promised no specific action or any specific time table -- I will get back to you didn't promise any --",
  "That is the allegation, and that's a conclusionary information and belief, easy to allege, hard to disprove allegation that can be made in every one of these cases. It's easy to imagine an infinite number of situations. I think it was Justice Ginsburg that was asking about the sting operation. The sting is a falsehood that's created by government to accomplish some law enforcement objective, but if it's a false storefront or something like that, it's a falsehood to a lot of different people. There are lots of different situations where the Government quite legitimately may have reasons to give false information out. We're not defending all the circumstances in which that might occur because there are duties and responsibilities and statutes that are imposed for that sort of thing. But to constitutionalize this subject would just put this broad blanket of inhibition over the whole disclosure of -- this was an informal oral communication. It wasn't a written communication. It wasn't where writing was occurred. She had at any time -- the respondent had at any time the opportunity and right to bring an action under -- to -- to bring a request and then an action under the Freedom of Information Act, which is Congress' carefully structured regime for receiving information from the Government. If she had received an evasive or nonresponsive answer in connection with the Freedom of Information Act, that would have been remedied or remedial in a court under the strictures that Congress carefully developed and this Court has implemented over the years. There's --",
  "Well, Justice O'Connor, even if she had gone -- well, she -- if she -- I wouldn't put it as exhaustion. What I'm suggesting is that because there is this regime in place already, there are other ways to get information from the Government. There -- there could have been a lawsuit brought at any time, although this would have been very, very remote, this lawsuit. And -- and the answers to questions could have been policed by a court. We're not suggesting that there's necessary an exhaustion requirement, but that to constitutionalize these exchanges and to create remedies for damages under these circumstances, when the legislature has developed an infinite -- I mean, not an infinite, but a substantial array of opportunities to both obtain information and to police the type of information that's obtained, if a Government official lies, there may be certain circumstances where they are subject to discipline. There -- there may be -- and we're talking about all levels of government, State, local, and the National Government. There may be remedies that are available. Many of the cases cited by the plaintiff were violations of underlying provisions of law. There was manufacturing of evidence in some of those cases. What we're saying is that there are ways to deal with Government-to-citizen communications that don't have the --",
  "Well, precisely.",
  "We believe that there is not. We believe that in each of those cases, there were circumstances where there were other rights that were violated, and that to take the step that those courts took, to the extent that they go beyond the violation of other underlying rights, would create this very problem that the Court urged caution about. The consequence could be the drying up of information. The creation of an additional right in those areas is problematical in the first place in terms of what it would accomplish beyond the rights that are already in existence. And the down side consequence to the Constitution, to the regular exchange of information, and the limitation, as this Court said in Glucksberg --",
  "Well, they --",
  "Of course. As a matter of -- as a matter of fact, Justice Scalia, what they did say is that -- and this is on page 20 of the transcript in the oral argument, and there is something similar in the -- in the brief, that they had -- that they -- we can't get back to you or we're not able to respond to you -- they suggested that that would be a perfectly constitutional response, or as you say, a no comment would be a perfectly constitutional response. That could have been a lie too. We can't -- I'm sorry we can't get back to you. Well, in fact, they could get back under the theory pleaded in the complaint. So, that would have been a lie too. It illustrates the slipperiness of the slope that the respondent's theory would ask the Court to embark upon. Any of those infinite varieties of exchanges under --",
  "Pardon me?",
  "No comment might not be a lie, Justice Stevens, but -- but the -- the respondent specifically says it would have been constitutional to say I cannot get back to you, or if there is information, we're not in a position to give it to you. There are -- that's -- those specific things that are in the brief itself and in the transcript of the oral argument could easily be lies as well, and they could easily be characterized as lies.",
  "I -- I hesitate ever to say anything of that sort. There are circumstances when it conceivably could. There could be legal duties triggering a requirement. In the habeas situation that one of the Justices asked about, there are rights of the individual which may be asserted by -- under appropriate next-friend standing, but it's the rights of the individual in custody.",
  "Absolutely, and that's another situation, Justice -- Chief Justice Rehnquist, in which if something is delayed -- and I think Justice Scalia asked that question. There's a tolling remedy. There's additional damages because of the delay. There are remedies in virtually all of these circumstances. One last point, if I still have time, is that the causation, the actual harm element of this so-called cause of action, is extraordinarily remote. The respondent is taking the position that if the Government had just answered constitutionally by saying no comment, somehow she might have filed a Freedom of Information case. It might have been in time. It might have been in time then for her to file some sort of justiciable, nonfrivolous cause of action, which she doesn't really ever fully identify except calling it some sort of injunction, and that that sort of injunction would have caused a court somehow to provide the opportunity to save the individual's life that she was attempting to save. That all is extraordinarily remote when -- when compounded with the various aspects of the elusive nature of the right being articulated here, the elusive nature of the remedy that could be -- possibly be given and the damage that constitutionalizing this right would create. We submit that this a course that this Court should not and would not under its precedents want to go.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The Census Bureau has consistently utilized the imputation technique for drawing inferences about a tiny fraction of damaged, discrepant or missing population data for the past five censuses.",
  "We agree that it is a statistical methodology, Justice Kennedy, and it's very important in that context to focus on the words of the statute. The words of the statute are that the statistical method known as sampling is the one that's prohibited with respect to the apportionment. That statement in the statute suggests that other statistical methods are not prohibited by the statuted, and that one particular statistical method, that is the one that is known as sampling, which is in quotes in the statute, which imports that it's a term of art that was known by Congress to be a term of art. It was a phrase that was suggested by the Secretary himself in 1957, when that statute was added, that exact phrase came from the Secretary. The Secretary was presumed to know what that phrase meant. It is a term of art that statisticians know what it is. Furthermore --",
  "It does not say that. In fact, the import of the statute, Justice Kennedy, is that statistical adjustments, and I will refer to what my colleague Mr. Dellinger just referred to, at page 22 in the Wisconsin decision which was unanimous decision by this Court just six years ago, distinguishing the sampling method that the Court was talking about in that case from statistical adjustments known as imputation, which is described on pages 4 and 5 of the Respondent's brief, referred to on those pages of the Supreme Court, this Court's unanimous decision just six years ago as being an entirely different thing. We would go back also to the fact that this Court unanimously held in that case that the Constitution vests virtually unlimited discretion in Congress respecting the manner in which the census shall be conducted, and that Congress has delegated its broad authority to the Secretary to take the census in such form and content as he shall direct. Now, the Congress has exercised that discretion by passing it on to the Secretary with the one limitation with respect, with respect to one statistical method known as sampling. Now, at the same time, the Secretary was proposing the prohibition of the sampling method; with respect to the apportionment of the census in 1957, the Secretary was planning the 1960 census, which was the first computerized census and the first time that the imputation method which we are talking about today was used. So it's obvious that the Secretary did not believe that hot-deck imputation was sampling, because the very next census three years later imputation was being used in that census. And it was used again in 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000. And with respect to 1970, and 1980, it was actually considered by this Court in connection with the Wisconsin case. It is widely understood in the industry that sampling is a collection of, a collection technique whereby a sample, a fraction of the whole population is used to deduct -- deduce the actual whole population. It seemed to me that a metaphor that might be considered outside the context of population gathering would be if the Court asked the library of this Court to ascertain the number of books, to conduct the number of books in the Court's library, and the, but sampling was not permitted to do that, so that the librarian could not go to every third shelf, multiply, count the books, multiply by three and get the census. But if the librarian went to those shelves and counted every particular volume and found that there was a space here on that shelf, a space this big on the next shelf, and a space this big on another shelf, for example, the imputation would be saying well, all the books or the books right next to this are this size, and therefore that space a book is missing, so we know we have a book, and we will impute one book to that space or two books to this space. So that the sampling technique is completely discrete from the imputation technique. We know that because the Secretary has always regarded it that way. The Congress has given the authority to this expert agency which has been conducting the census for years and years and has drawn various different types of inferences which is what imputations are.",
  "Well, yes, I think that's an extension of it. In the example that I was giving you look at the space and impute the size of the space by the book that is immediately next to it.",
  "Well, I'm not sure. That's a good question. I don't know the answer to why it should be called statistics, because in my thinking of it, it is drawing logical inferences from the data available. Now Justice O'Connor, it is not creating phantom homes. Most of these cases in, the statistics indicated that with respect to one of the forms of the imputation, and this is in the record at the joint appendix, the information may be found in pages 445 through 448 of the joint appendix, that 98 percent of the household size imputation forms were enumerator forms with the status of occupied homes. Now, the problem is that with respect to any, and the statistics are different, but in 93 percent with respect to occupancy imputation, 75 percent with respect to status imputation. Each of these are attempting to find actual people drawing from the closest comparable unit and it's one unit for each inference. It's not extrapolating from one unit to the whole population. The problem with the census is that there are billions of pieces of paper as Mr. Dellinger indicated. Some people refuse to return the forms and their known addresses. Some people fill out the forms incorrectly. They may say occupied but zero. The enumerators might get bad information. In 1850, a substantial portion of the entire State of California the returns were actually burned, and the Census Bureau in 1850 actually used a process to replace the 70,000 people that were not there. And one of the questions indicated, neighbors have been used as proxies. Heads of households have been used as proxies. Postal service has been used as proxies. These are all means by which the postal, the Census Bureau attempts to develop the most accurate count it possibly can.",
  "That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and that was the way it was done in 1790.",
  "Well, it's not necessarily statistical. And I guess that, the fact is that as far as the statute is concerned, there is only one technique that's prohibited. The technique of drawing inferences through sampling is prohibited. It's prohibited probably because Congress feels that it might be subject to manipulation.",
  "Well, Justice O'Connor, the expert agency to which Congress delegated this broad authority doesn't believe so. That seems to me that there should be a substantial deference to the expertise of the agency. Not only that, but Congress with full awareness that hot-deck imputation has been used over the past --",
  "Hot-deck imputation is distinguishable from cold-deck imputation in the sense that information from the most current census and the actual neighborhood, the most current available information for the actual census that's being developed is being used. Now where that term came from, I don't know. But that's what it means. But this methodology has been used with the knowledge of Congress, with the full knowledge of Congress, for the past five censuses. There was litigation over this matter, it's referred to as the Orr case in the briefs, where a seat may have been allocated to Indiana or Florida, depending upon how the imputation process came out. So that litigation took place. Congress actually changed the terminology, Section 141, which provides the Secretary with the authority to conduct the census in a manner that the Secretary thinks appropriate, in 1976. After imputation had been used in two censuses already.",
  "Well, as a matter of fact, in the unanimous decision of this Court in the Wisconsin case six years ago, the court said substantial deference should be owed to the agency.",
  "But the reasoning of the Court, I would submit, is --",
  "Justice Scalia, not only the Wisconsin case, but the other decisions of this Court which have considered census have suggested that the framers of the Constitution by using the word enumeration didn't mean a particular method by which the census would be conducted, nor did it wish to constrain both the Congress and whomever the Congress may delegate to --",
  "Presumably. Possibly.",
  "Possibly, Justice Scalia. But that's nowhere close to that and this is not remotely sampling.",
  "This is not remotely estimation. This is drawing an inference with respect to one particular piece of data. We would agree that the gross estimation --",
  "In each of these cases, Justice Scalia, the words can be changed and added to, but the process by which the framers analyzed this in framing the Constitution, the very first House of Representatives was assigned according to an estimation, and the words actual enumeration were used to compare an actual count, an effort to find the actual number of people by indulging in a process --",
  "What I think the Constitution and courts with respect to the term actual enumeration, is an effort to go out and find a count. We, we pointed out that the, the enumeration can mean listing by particular items as used in the Ninth Amendment, the enumerated powers. It may be a process by which a count might be taken or it might simply refer to a census, find the population. We submit that the Capitation Clause as we have referred to in our brief, which uses the word census and enumeration indistinguishably as synonyms, and in fact the Appellants in their brief, in their reply brief at page 15 acknowledge that the words enumeration and census are used in the Constitution interchangeably. Justice Scalia, it didn't seem, it does not seem that the framers of the Constitution actually specified a method. And in fact, what the Appellants were saying here today and are saying in their briefs, every census conducted by asking people who may have lived next door or drawing inferences from other pieces of information would not have been the individual by individual count that --",
  "I think --",
  "Well, we are not remotely close to that here. But with respect --",
  "From the standpoint of the Constitution, I think a reasonably good argument could be made and the Government has in the past made it, that sampling if it is consistent with the process of an attempt to find an actual count utilizing sophisticated accurate and nonmanipulatable techniques --",
  "I believe it does and I think, Chief Justice, the District Court in this case distinguished actual enumeration from the conjectural apportionment that actually occurred in the Constitution itself with respect to the first House of Representatives. What we are talking about here today, though, is an effort to, an effort to produce extremely conscientious and meticulous, to count all of the households in the United States starting with a meticulously prepared master address list. All of those people were submitted post office forms which has been authorized by Congress for a certain --",
  "Well, we --",
  "If this Court is to, determines that the process by which the 2000 census was conducted was inconsistent with the statute or inconsistent with the Constitution and orders the Secretary to take out the imputed numbers --",
  "-- and deliver a different piece of information to the President --",
  "-- the President will transmit that certificate or that certified, those certified results to Congress for the process. In other words, in answer to your question, the President will do what this Court assumed in those cases that the President would do.",
  "The President will --",
  "The President is willing to accept the import, not only of the Franklin and the other decision that we referred to, but also if this Court decides that the process was unconstitutional or inconsistent with the statute, the President will accept that, this Court's judgment in that respect.",
  "Well, if, for that reason, if Mr. Chief Justice, the Court decides that that is not the kind of result that this Court can issue, because of that possibility, we'll accept that result as well.",
  "But we think -- we think it is very unlikely for that to occur, because it is quite clear that the Constitution intended to give considerable flexibility, did not want to freeze in a system the ability of the Government.",
  "Yes, Justice Stevens.",
  "I'm not sure of the answer to that question. I guess the answer is that is correct. Or no. That it has been certified and I would gather that it would have to be a revised certification if that should occur.",
  "What we are saying --",
  "I only can answer it this way, Justice Scalia. If this Court determines that the process before was unconstitutional or in violation of the statute and the Secretary must redo it and if that information is transmitted to the Secretary, he will transmit that.",
  "Then I misunderstood your question.",
  "If it is based upon a decision by this Court that the Court has the power to issue --",
  "I think that that would only occur in the context of this Court's decision.",
  "I don't think we need to give anything away, Justice Scalia. We would be talking about a context in which this Court came to the conclusion it could render a jurisprudentially binding decision in a case in which there was redressability in that context.",
  "Let me just summarize because my time is about up. This Court's words again, that the Constitution gave virtually unlimited discretion to the Congress with respect to the manner in which the census would be --",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. There is no evidence that the framers of the Constitution wanted to bind themselves to a particular method of counting people. All of the evidence suggested that what the framers wanted to do was to have a reasonably reliable accurate, reasonably accurate count of the citizens in the manner that the, that Congress would determine. Congress in the words of this Court has delegated all of that broad authority to the Census Bureau. The Census Bureau, conscientiously using a technique that they have been using consistently for 50 years with the awareness of Congress, the General Accounting Office, oversight committees and the actual awareness of this Court, as reflected in this 1996 decision, has demonstrated, developed a method that is reasonably accurate, uses statistical methods other than those known as sampling to get an accurate court. We urge the Court to sustain that outcome.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit has created a new constitutional rule for guilty pleas that is neither required by the Constitution nor warranted by this Court's previous decisions. Its inevitable effect would be to complicate and expose to collateral attack confessions of guilt which -- which account for approximately 95 percent of all convictions in the Federal system and to stifle the market for plea bargains, which this Court has described as an essential component of the administration of justice. The Ninth Circuit held that an accused cannot enter a valid guilty plea unless he is first given all evidence in the prosecutor's possession which would have a reasonable probability of discouraging him from pleading guilty. The Ninth Circuit's rule, new rule, is not a logical extension of the Brady -- Brady v. Maryland, which is premised on concern over the constitutional fairness of criminal trials. Brady and its progeny require disclosure only when necessary to ensure a fair trial. In fact, in Brady itself, the Court was explicit to point out that it -- that decision was premised on the avoidance of an unfair trial to the accused. The subsequent cases, which have expanded upon or interpreted or explained Brady, have been even more specific with respect to the limitations on the scope of Brady. In U.S. v. Agurs, the Court said the prosecutor will not have violated his constitutional duty unless his omission is of sufficient significance to result in the denial of a fair trial. Something similar was said in U.S. v. Bagley. Brady's purpose is not to displace the adversary system as the primary means by which truth is uncovered. If it did not deprive a defendant of a fair trial, there is no constitutional violation.",
  "Yes, Justice Ginsburg. The agreement to which Justice Ginsburg is referring is set out -- the two paragraphs of that agreement --",
  "Yes, and I also have it on -- on page 12 of the joint appendix.",
  "Page 12 of the joint appendix. It's the --",
  "It's -- it's on page 14a of the petition -- of the appendix to the petition for certiorari.",
  "The answer to that, Justice Ginsburg, is that both in the Sanchez decision and in this case, the Ruiz decision, the Ninth Circuit went further and made it clear that it was applying the rule that it applied in this case to all exculpatory material which, if known to the defendant, might cause the defendant not to plead guilty. Now, the undertaking that was made in the particular proposed agreement here went a little bit further in the direction of the defendant, which often happens. Prosecutors frequently will decide, for one reason or another, to give exculpatory information of some sort to a defendant. But the Ninth Circuit went further than that and made it clear that the rule that it was enunciating applied to all exculpatory material, including impeachment material, and that is the rule that's going to be applicable in the Ninth Circuit. So, even if this Court determined to limit its decision to the -- the narrower scope, as articulated in the second paragraph of that proposed agreement, we'd be back here next year because it's quite clear what the Ninth Circuit intends to do with its rule.",
  "No, it was not, Mr. Chief Justice. This was a -- simply a -- a draft agreement which was, in fact, prepared in response -- as a result of and in response to the earlier Sanchez decision, which -- which the Ninth Circuit had articulated. This was an effort by the prosecutor --",
  "It's -- it's not in the record, Justice Scalia, but it's my understanding that it's something that is -- is developed particularly to deal with the Sanchez case which the Ninth Circuit had already decided, and the presumption that the Ninth -- the Ninth Circuit's Sanchez decision went so far and not as far as the -- that that covered the impeachment material, but not other exculpatory material in the reverse. So, however inartful this is, it was not in response, Mr. Chief Justice, to a court order or any other legal requirement, nor does it purport to articulate what the law is. It purports to undertake what the prosecutor voluntarily was willing to do with respect to this particular form of plea --",
  "No.",
  "This is -- this was developed just in the San Diego -- the Southern District of California, although other versions in other places, but there's no standard national form for plea agreements.",
  "The Ninth Circuit -- let me answer the jurisdictional point first. The Ninth Circuit perceived that it had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. 3742(a)(1).",
  "A -- that the sentence was imposed or the --",
  "And -- and that the Ninth Circuit perceived that the district court felt that it was barred by law from departing --",
  "And -- and that the Ninth Circuit felt that because this was a constitutional right that the defendant was -- had that was being withheld from the defendant because of the -- of the circumstances of this case, that the -- the district court erroneously presumed that it was prevented from going in a -- in a direction that the Ninth Circuit felt that it could go. And I think that then ties in with your second -- your second question with respect to the sentencing guidelines and section 5K2. The -- the court felt -- the Ninth Circuit felt -- and it's not very clear, but -- and -- and the Government is not objecting to the -- the way the Ninth Circuit exercised jurisdiction at this point and is not opposing the court's decision with respect to jurisdiction at this point. The Ninth Circuit felt that under section 5K2 of the sentencing guidelines, this would be a -- mitigate -- the -- the entry into the so-called fast track program was a mitigating circumstance of a kind or a degree not adequately taken into account by the guidelines in formulating the guidelines. It should result in a sentence different --",
  "Well, but -- yes.",
  "It -- it -- I think the answer to that latter point with respect to the individual consideration is covered by the fact that this particular program, under the circumstances of this district, are -- they may be -- it may be frequently occurring, but it's individualistic in the sense that entering into this program alleviates a substantial amount of work and -- and provides a substantial benefit to the prosecutor in that district without which the prosecutor may not be able to enforce the law on all of the responsibilities of the law. This is one of the most busy districts of the United States because of the tremendous number of narcotics crimes coming in across the border, multiplied in a sense by the number of immigration violations that take place. So that this was an individualized circumstance in that district. Now, one could quibble about the appropriateness of that, but that's how the Ninth Circuit perceived it. It perceived that it had jurisdiction on that basis, and we're not objecting to it. It seems clear that not only, therefore, that not -- that this right is not required by or implicit within Brady, but that the language of the Court's decisions interpreting Brady make it clear that Brady is not supposed to go that far, that it only has to do with the rights at -- at trial. Furthermore, the solution that the Ninth Circuit proposed with respect to this is both overly broad and underly inclusive. If the Court was concerned, as it said it was and as the respondent contends it should be, with the potential of innocent persons pleading guilty, the test itself, which is set out in the court's -- the -- the Ninth Circuit's opinion on page -- I think it's 15a of the appendix to the petition for certiorari. About midway through the page, the court says, the evidence is material under the test announced in this case if there is a reasonable probability that but for the failure to disclose the Brady material, the defendant would have refused to plead and would have gone to trial. In other words, the test is not couched in terms of the potential innocence of the defendant or the risk that a defendant was -- was innocent. It's couched in terms of the tactical decision a defendant might make with respect to whether or not to go trial.",
  "Precisely. In fact --",
  "Exactly, Justice Scalia. In fact, this Court has frequently said that -- that there are lots of risks involved in the -- in the defense of a case, a criminal case, and -- and there are risks and benefits and burdens and evaluations that must be taken into consideration.",
  "Well, I think it's taken care of in several ways. If the -- the Constitution gives the defendant a right to trial or a right to confront witnesses, a right to counsel, reasonably competent, informed counsel. Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure require a relatively exhaustive procedure where the court makes sure that the guilty plea is voluntary and intelligent and that the elements of the crime, of course, are involved in whether or not --",
  "The standard -- the standards for prosecutors in the United States -- for the United States are set forth in the -- the U.S. Attorneys Manual. It requires prosecutors not to bring a case unless they believe in good faith that there is a reasonable basis for the case that's being brought, in fact a reasonable basis for believing that there could be a conviction based upon evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. That's not a constitutional standard, Justice Kennedy. The constitutional standard is set forth in the -- this Court's decisions with respect to the right to counsel, the right to trial, the right to intelligent information with respect to that. Rule 11, which is a -- which is a joint product of the courts and the -- and the legislature, sets out elaborate procedures pursuant to which a Federal judge will inquire with respect to the basis for the plea, explain the rights that the defendant has violated, and specifically requires the Federal court to find that there's a factual basis for the plea. Now, so that what I was saying was that is the remedy, the so-called remedy, that the Ninth Circuit has come up -- is -- is under-inclusive to the extent that if it's concerned about -- it's over-inclusive to the extent that it's concerned about innocent people pleading guilty because it doesn't go to the -- the factual innocent. It goes to the tactical decisions, the rolling of the dice, with respect to what are the chances of winning or losing in court.",
  "Well, no, there's nothing unethical about the lawyer trying to figure out what the odds are. In fact, rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure give fairly elaborate rights of discovery to the defendant's counsel. And at that plea agreement, the judge will inquire with respect to whether there's a factual basis for the plea agreement. In fact, the judge in this case specifically addressed that question to the defendant, asked the defendant is it, indeed, true -- asked the defendant and then the counsel interceded and said, yes, she was bringing in her car 60 -- 60 pounds of marijuana. And then the judge turned to the defendant and said, is that true? And the defendant said, yes, I knew that it was --",
  "Well, I don't -- I'm not sure either. It would all depend upon the circumstance. There is -- there is a possibility that this Court's recognized in the Alford decision a possibility of making a plea which is -- which is not incompatible with a defendant's assertion of innocence. But I think that in most cases the defendant is the one who will know more than anyone, the prosecutor or anyone else, whether the defendant is guilty.",
  "Well, I understand that, Justice Stevens. That may happen in a particular case. This Court said in Bagley that Brady's primary purpose is not to -- Brady's purpose is not to displace the adversary system as the primary means by which truth is -- as the primary means by which truth is uncovered. And I think that the answer to your question is that this system, no system is perfect or ever will be perfect, but we do have a panoply of constitutional rights. We insist that the defendant be adequately counseled. We insist that the judge through rule -- through rule 16 --",
  "Absolutely. And I must -- I must say that with respect to -- we're not talking about that case here. We're talking about a blanket rule which would apply in 57 -- you know, 57,000-some guilty pleas in the Federal system every year.",
  "The Court said that explicitly.",
  "Well --",
  "And I would answer that in two ways. In the first place, I think the Chief Justice answered it by referring to the Brady v. United States case.",
  "I understand, Justice Breyer, I understand what you're saying. And there's a certain -- there's a certain logic to it. But if that is -- if that was the case, then the Ninth Circuit's rule is under- inclusive because if the defendant really wants to know what the best chances are, rather than the exculpatory material or the impeachment material, what he is going to want to know is the inculpatory material. And you made the point about the other -- other prosecutions that are being held over the defendant's head. He's going to want to know what -- well, what evidence do they have on the greater offense that they're about to charge me with, because I'm going to take my chances now and plead to this lesser included offense. So, if the Ninth Circuit wanted to accomplish what you're talking about as the thrust of your question, it would have gone -- and I suspect that it will --",
  "No. I'm not --",
  "This Court -- this Court has said that it's perfectly appropriate in the adversarial system for the prosecutor to find legitimate ways to encourage guilty defendants to plead guilty. Now, we -- you're absolutely right. It's --",
  "But there's --",
  "-- Justice Scalia --",
  "-- nothing in this case that involves that issue at all. We have a guilty defendant who has acknowledged under oath -- I think it was under oath. Usually it is, in the Federal court systems -- that this person was guilty. So, you are faced with the possibility of drafting a rule -- or the Ninth Circuit drafted a rule for a hypothetical situation not involving the case before it, which was over-inclusive because it includes the vast number of people that are indeed guilty, and under-inclusive because it doesn't provide a remedy -- the best remedy which we would definitely not encourage, but I would suggest would be the next step, possibly from the same circuit, with respect to giving additional information. And it would be inconsistent not only with that, but it would be inconsistent with what this Court has said over and over again with respect to the value of competent counsel, the fact that certain chances have to be taken, that a defendant is not entitled to set aside a plea because he may have misconstrued the weight or balance of the prosecution's case, or there may have been mistakes of law. In one -- in -- in Brady v. the United States, in fact, it was a misconstruction of whether or not the defendant would -- could be -- could be put to death if the defendant went to trial. So, this Court has recognized that there are those balances in the system. But what the -- what we urge upon the Court is that there are so many protections, including the discovery right, the fairly exhaustive --",
  "That would -- that would come out through rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which is set out in the appendix, I think 3a to 5a, of our brief on the merits. The defendant is given pretrial considerable discovery rights to find out those sorts of things, and if the defendant is not sure and, after consultation with his counsel, wishes to go to trial, there's -- the Brady rights do kick in at an appropriate time to allow the defendant to prepare for trial. What I'm saying is that -- that the combination of the constitutional rights to trial and -- and confrontation, the constitutional rights to counsel, the -- the statutory rights to discovery, the statutory obligations on a judge to make sure there's a factual basis for the guilty plea, the obligations -- and we have to assume under -- as this Court suggested in the Mezzanatto case, a -- a good faith behavior by our public officials that a prosecutor is not going to withhold evidence in -- on -- where it knows that the -- this is an innocent defendant. Those are ample assurances, especially in the context, as this Court has said over and over again, that the best person to know whether there's a factual basis for a plea of guilty is the defendant himself or herself. I will say one more thing that is -- that seems to me important with respect to the -- this -- the posture in which this case comes. If this Court were to determine that there is a constitutional right -- and we think that neither this Court's decisions nor the Constitution would lead the Court to that conclusion -- the constitutional right could be waived. The Ninth Circuit said that a defendant cannot, even if the defendant wanted to, plead guilty. Knowing that the defendant was guilty, the defendant could not waive the right. Now, that has several implications. It -- it creates problems for the criminal justice system. The Brady -- the Brady right that the Ninth Circuit would engraft on the system here would force prosecutors to develop cases and use resources at the defendant's initiative, on the defendant's time table. It creates -- turns Brady -- the right, from a fair trial right into a fair trial preparation right. With respect to certain types of cases, it would compromise conspiracy cases, racketeering cases, organized crime drug cases, white collar cases where there may be substantial warehouses full of documents. In other words, many prosecutors won't be preparing their case for determining what witnesses they're going to use until they're ready to go to trial. Once they -- if they had to disclose this information on the defendant's time table, which the defendant -- if this rule were adopted by this Court, the first thing a defendant would do is offer -- say, \"I'm thinking about pleading guilty. Give me everything in your files.\" Now, a prosecutor in complicated cases is not going to want to do that and -- and will refuse to engage in that process or will -- once -- once it does so, there's no more incentive for the -- for the prosecutor to enter into the plea bargaining process. So, it could be damaging to the benefits of the defendants over and over again that's received the benefits of the plea bargaining system, which this Court has sanctioned and encouraged.",
  "The --she -- she --",
  "-- she -- I don't -- I don't know whether she's served the entire -- the sentence that was given to her was 18 months in incarceration and a 3-month -- a 3-year --",
  "-- probationary period. I think that that would continue to go on. That was at the very low range, low end of the guideline sentence.",
  "Yes, I believe so, Justice Kennedy, but I'm not sure, 100 percent sure, factually I know the answer to that. If I may reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. What the respondent is proposing and what the Ninth Circuit adopted is an unworkable and undesirable rule to solve a nonexistent problem. And it's illustrated by the facts of this case. The footnote or the -- the pages in the respondent's brief cite some cases in which theoretically it might be that some driver who crossed the line earlier might create a problem, but that is not this case. And there's no empirical evidence or any other evidence in the record that would show that there's a significant problem here. The --",
  "I think that is not an easy situation, but I think that the Ninth Circuit believed that however inartfully the district court expressed it or incompletely the district court expressed it, that the -- that the district court was saying it didn't feel that it had the capacity or the ability under the law to depart, that it didn't have the discretion to do so. That's what the Ninth Circuit decided. We argued otherwise to the Ninth Circuit --",
  "It could mean that. That's how the Ninth Circuit -- Circuit perceived it.",
  "We -- we believe that we -- after looking at it carefully, we've decided that the Ninth Circuit probably was right under the circumstances, although you could argue it the other way, and that this -- this is an issue that is presented clearly with respect to the -- the legal standard that's been adopted to the -- by the Ninth Circuit and which is in play today. The -- the respondent says, well, pleas are proceeding apace in California notwithstanding -- or in the Ninth Circuit, notwithstanding the decision in this case. There is no evidence in the record to suggest that this hasn't created a problem, and in fact, I'm informed that there are cases that have not been brought and cases that have been dismissed because of a concern about complying with the rule in this case, because once that's done, those cases are -- are potentially over with. But the fact is there's no evidence either way. Justice Breyer, you raised some questions about whether we would be constitutionalizing a rule which would change Jencks and change the discovery rules. There -- there -- on page 26 of the Government's brief, we talked about the fact that there have been efforts to change and accelerate the discovery requirements and that those have been soundly rejected for the very reasons we've been talking about here. And the Jencks standard is what it is because there's very much concern over the safety of witnesses when those statements are produced earlier in the case. And that's -- Congress has made that decision quite consciously that those statements don't have to be produced until the witness is actually called in trial for that reason. Let me finish by saying that with respect to Hill v. Lockhart, that's a case involving a requirement that a defendant have, under the Sixth Amendment, competent counsel within the range of -- of competence expected for counsel in criminal cases. That's a Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. It is not a -- a constitutional right to effective assistance of the prosecution in deciding whether to plead guilty or not. What we have in this case is a rule which is not required, which -- which would cause considerable problems. It would undermine the plea bargaining system, which is important to the administration of criminal justice in this country, and affect the finality of guilty pleas, which is an important consideration as well.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The questions today, especially the initial questions, suggest one of the many insurmountable obstacles to petitioners' petition in, position in this case. That is that the first Congress explicitly gave copyright protection to the authors of any books already printed as well as explicitly the owners of existing copyrights. Thereafter, in 1831, 1909, 1976, and 1998, and in numerous private copyright bills and temporary extensions of the copyright law and in repeated patent law revisions, Congress extended the terms of Federal copyright and patent protection of subsisting works. As this Court explained 100 and some years ago in its Burrows-Giles opinion, such constructions are accorded very great weight and, as that Court went on to say, when consistent and unchallenged for over a century are almost conclusive that consistent construction by Congress of its authority under the Copyright and Patent Clause now has lasted from the 105th -- from the first through the 105th Congress. It has been sustained by Justices of this Court and early decisions of this Court. It is consistent with what the law of England was from the Statute of Anne --",

  "It contains -- the clause itself contains limitations, limited times, authors, exclusive rights and things of that nature. I don't think -- and the petitioners expressly disclaim the assertion that there are any substantive limitations in the \"Promote the- Progress\" Clause. What the Framers were saying is, we want to give Congress the authority to promote the progress of useful arts and sciences, and --",
  "Well, it may provide additional incentives for the patentee to exploit and promote and disseminate that particular work. With respect to creative works like works of art, books and that sort of thing, it may provide many ways --",
  "It isn't inconsistent, I submit, Justice Stevens, for the Congress to exercise its juris -- its responsibility under this broad grant of power to determine that there could be many ways in which the holder of an existing right may benefit the public by continuing to have that right for an additional period of time, the same reason that Congress -- same reasons that Congress had when it created the right in the first place. It's not just the right --",
  "Well, but I -- we submit that specifically with respect to the Copyright Clause, but I think it applies to the patent portion of the clause at all, it isn't just the invention, it isn't just the writing of the work -- and this relates to the questions that were asked of my colleague a moment ago. It includes the dissemination of the work, not necessarily --",
  "Not necessarily the dissemination alone --",
  "That something is already in the public domain.",
  "I would not want to rule that out, Justice Breyer, for the very reason --",
  "Well, I think that it could very well be yes, for the reason that in the 1790 statute the Congress specifically was aware of -- that there were State copyright laws which didn't last as long as the Federal statute. Several of the States hadn't finished enacting those copyright laws, and a couple of States hadn't enacted them at all.",
  "It's --",
  "It may --",
  "Well --",
  "Well, because I don't think that a per -- I don't think there is a per se rule that should apply here because this is a grant of Congress, to Congress to exercise its judgment as to what may be beneficial. There may be other constitutional provisions that come into play, or there may be other existing --",
  "Well, I also see compliance with international competitive markets and the laws that are being adopted, and the incentives --",
  "Well, that's not just uniformity. It's providing incentive to people to publish here, as opposed to publish in Europe, where longer terms might be available. There is an incentive to distribute existing works that may be necessary. It's the consistency that Congress is promoting by saying to individuals, as they might have said when they enacted the Copyright Clause in the first place, we will not only give you 14 years, but if we change our mind tomorrow, and think that a better, a longer period is necessary, we're -- this is consistency, but it's also a matter of fairness, and it's --",
  "Well, I think that that's a very good illustration of why the authority is granted to Congress, because if you are an 80-year-old writer, that may make a considerable difference in terms of what you decide to do.",
  "It may -- because you may -- if you have no incentive, if you know that this is going to go into the public domain sooner rather than later, it may affect your judgment with respect to --",
  "It might also affect whether the publisher -- what the publisher pays for your prospective work, Justice Breyer. We -- the Copyright Clause incentive provides incentives not just for -- not just to the creators, but to the disseminators, the publishers, the broadcasters, the film companies.",
  "Well, I think again that illustrates why the authority is vested in Congress to make these judgments rather than in courts to make these judgments, because we're not talking about the effect on an individual author, or an individual creator. What the Framers of the Constitution were concerned about is a gross judgment with respect to what might generally provide incentives to the population --",
  "Well, that's a -- that is a difficult question to say whether there is any limiting principle when such a broad grant of power, authority is given to Congress and has been exercised so repeatedly that --",
  "What I submit -- well, first of all, even the petitioners acknowledge that, as far as prospective limits are concerned, that isn't a judgment that this Court is being made to ask and, in fact, the petitioners acknowledge that it isn't a judgment that this Court should make, so the only point that the petitioners --",
  "That would seem --",
  "I acknowledge that. And anything that --",
  "Well --",
  "It is -- well, it -- let me say with respond -- in response to both of those questions, an unlimited time would violate the Copyright Clause. Something that was the functional equivalent of an unlimited time would violate the Copyright Clause, but the Framers specifically did not put in numbers. They had the opportunity to do that. Thomas Jefferson suggested that a number should be put in. We submit that it would be -- even -- since the petitioners don't suggest that it's an appropriate function of this Court, certainly in this case, to pick a number, 133 years or something of that nature, but it is quite clear that Congress from the Statute of Anne, 1710, we have 300 years of history, of Congress thinking that it continues to benefit the process, not just of the productivity, of the creation of the work itself, but the dissemination of it to provide --",

  "Yes, but all of the history of the development of these clauses suggests that -- and this Court has indicated in its decisions with respect to copyright, that the Framers were concerned and the Congress is legitimately concerned not just in providing the spark of creativity, but to make sure that that's distributed widely and available, and there may be many reasons why -- we're -- we --",
  "Yes, and what -- but the definition of the term was a responsibility vested in Congress, because it has the power -- the legislative history of the 1998 act itself suggests what was going on here and suggests why the Framers gave this authority to Congress. There were numerous hearings, there were testimony by the folks that represent the same position as petitioners here as to why this shouldn't be done, why it should be done. Congress weighed -- as this Court, the phrase that this Court used, I think it was in the Feist case, the delicate balance that was so difficult for Congress to --",
  "Well, the --",
  "The -- as we described in our brief, in pages 34 through 36, I believe it is in our brief, that the concerns about the limitation on exploitation and the limitation of a copyright period in Europe is based upon the country of origin of the work and the shortest time available. So that there may be differences, and we describe that, but that illustrates, Justice Breyer, the difference between 1 cents and 10 cents and $100 with respect to this particular author who's this particular age, or a particular author like Melville, whose works weren't -- weren't -- didn't -- or Schubert, whose works weren't properly appreciated or exploitable until many years after their death. All of these variations are quintessentially legislative judgments. It would be very difficult for the Framers to have eschewed deciding 14 years was a constitutional limitation, and for this Court to say 99 years is, and again, even the petitioners aren't asking the Court to make that judgment. The petitioners are only saying that there shall be a per se rule that the word \"limited times,\" means unchangeable times.",
  "Well, the issue before this Court, I hasten to say, as I said before, is only whether, once the Congress makes that judgment, it can ever change it retrospectively. The issue before this Court is not whether, in the future, a certain length of time would be appropriate. That -- but the answer to that, Justice Ginsburg, I submit, is found in the Necessary and Proper Clause, and this Court's interpretation of the Necessary and Proper Clause as to the extent that this Court would find or not find that the judgment made by Congress with respect to the implementation of this very broad power is convenient or useful in terms of the achievement of the goals.",
  "That is among our arguments, Justice Souter.",
  "I think that's a fair statement of an argument that we have made and articulated in the brief --",
  "-- that unless there is a -- the Court is -- because the circumstances change, that we are living in an era now where piracy is a significant problem, there's question of administrative ease, of administering a system where copyrights may be different for one set of authors, or different for another set of authors, there's changes that are taking place internationally, so that what we're saying is that not only could this Court conceive of reasons why Congress thought it was accomplishing the objectives of this clause, but that there are numerous objectives that are entirely legitimate in --",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, Justice Scalia, and the examples that are --",
  "The implicit promise that --",
  "I think that's not an unreasonable expectation at all, Justice Stevens, because that was the premise of the --",
  "That's --",
  "That is correct.",
  "That is correct.",
  "You could arguably -- you could conceivably make that argument, Justice Souter, but there is a bright line there. Something that has already gone into the public domain, which other individuals or companies or entities may then have acquired an interest in, or rights to, or be involved in disseminating --",
  "This is a rational --",
  "Oh, I concede that it's a bright line, but it's a bright line that would have --",
  "Congress --",
  "I agree, and this Court has -- we're not just talking about the judgment of the Congress of the -- the 105th Congress in 1998. This is the way the Statute of Anne was written. This is the way the State copyright laws were written when this country became a Nation. This is the way the 1790 copyright statute, the number of --",
  "Well, there was an interest in having a uniform rule, and that's precisely why the Framers created the Copyright Clause in the Constitution, but there was copyright protection in some States, there wasn't copyright protection in other States, and what we know from the decision of this Court in the Wheaton decision is that there was not a common law copyright in existence. This Court explicitly held that. Now, the petitioners make this quid pro quo argument that somehow implicitly the initial 1790 copyright statute was saying to people, you get a copyright if you exchange whatever existing rights you have. That simply does not make any sense. There is no language, and it's a relatively late-discovered argument, because it sees its full --",
  "I wasn't finished, but I'm happy to come back.",
  "Well, I was going to say there's no language whatsoever of preemption, abandonment, abrogation, or exchange in the 1790 copyright, but compare -- Copyright Act. But compare that to the 1793 Patent Act under the same clause, where there is that exchange there. The other thing, as this Court has said, there is no implied abrogation of common law rights which would be a doctrine which would be inconsistent with what the petitioner is arguing. Now --",
  "Well, it --",
  "Justice Breyer, it's conceivable that the Court might do that if that situation was present, but it's not remotely the situation here. We have the adoption of copyright terms which are consistent, generally speaking, with copyright terms which exist in the European Union, our principal competitor, and in connection with international treaties. We have a copyright term that's consistent with the concept of the creator plus the creator's first generation heirs. We have a copyright term, remember, which supersedes the earlier copyright provisions that were added to the period between creation and publication, so that the limited number of years in the first, the 1790 and the 1831 statute were the number of years plus the relatively unlimited period of time between creation and publication, so we don't have anything remotely like that in this situation. We have a process which, as you suggested, or one of the questions suggested, is -- may not have been the policy that you as a Member of Congress would have supported. You might have made the balance, that delicate balance that this Court has referred to, in another way, but that is something that Congress, through its ability to gather facts and make balances, is quintessentially capable of doing, and that is where the Framers vested the responsibility, and what this statute does is to favor, if at all, the creator with respect to the utilization of these rights, as opposed to the person who wishes to copy the creator. That's an entirely rational distinction for Congress to make. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: General Blumenthal conveyed three very important aspects of this case in his opening sentence. In essence, he said the people of Connecticut seek access to concededly truthful, public record and otherwise public available information concerning convicted sex offenders. These individuals have no constitutional right to conceal these public truths from interested public citizens. The Second Circuit examined the registry and said not only is the information about every individual concededly true, but the registry -- and this is set out verbatim in page 6 of Connecticut's -- the blue brief. The Department of Public Safety has not considered or assessed the specific risk of re-offense of any individual prior to his or her inclusion within this registry and has made no determination that any individual included in the registry is currently dangerous.",
  "Exactly.",
  "Well, that's true, Justice Ginsburg. It is not repeated for every name in the registry, but it's clearly set forth in the registry itself. It's put in italics. And the -- and the State goes on to say, individuals included within the registry are included solely by virtue of their conviction record and State law. The main purpose of providing the -- this data on the Internet is to make the information more easily accessible and available, not to warn about any specific individual --",
  "Well, what they do say is that the public is entitled to and should make specific judgments about specific individuals.",
  "Precisely. And the point that you were making earlier, Justice Souter, is that there are different types of crimes that may be of interest to different individuals. If you have small --",
  "Because they are -- they are responding to the people's request in 50 States -- and the people of the United States through the Congress -- to make information available to us about people who have been convicted of sex crimes.",
  "Well --",
  "If -- if -- there -- that's -- the Federal statute allows the State to exercise judgment with respect to the use of its resources with respect to this public record, truthful information. Now, the State of Connecticut -- the question that you're raising, it seems to me, falls squarely within the concept of a substantive due process challenge, not a --",
  "But the State --",
  "The label that the State is putting on is that you have been convicted of a sex crime and that the -- and you must draw -- we have not decided that you are dangerous.",
  "Well, the -- the Court has said repeatedly that the -- this Court will examine challenges with respect to the -- the -- in that category on a substantive due process basis if the classification is reasonable --",
  "Well, and -- and our submission is that the determination -- and this Court has stated it as recently -- recently as a year ago that sex offenders are more likely to be recidivists than other categories of individuals, but that that does not mean, Connecticut goes on to say, that any individual is necessarily dangerous. That classification is rational. Now, it is also rational for Connecticut to have determined, as it did, that we'll accord opportunities for people to address in -- in certain circumstances the nature of their conviction. But it's also rational for --",
  "We think that that would be a very difficult situation, Justice Stevens, in that -- the -- and -- and I would be concerned about that. But --",
  "Well, because that requires the individual to carry that notification himself to convey the government's message.",
  "It also requires that message to be brought into every situation that the individual is involved in. The Internet is a reasonable and relative -- minimally intrusive way of responding to a question that a citizen may ask of a State and to which the citizen is entitled to an answer. The citizen here has to ask the question. It isn't carried around with the individual everywhere the individual goes. And this is public record information. As one of the questions in the earlier argument implied, if a private citizen -- Cox Broadcasting, for example -- decided to make this information available to the public, it would be -- have an absolute constitutional right to do so. It seems anomalous to suggest that the State of Connecticut cannot impart to its citizens the same information that Cox Broadcasting would have an absolute constitutional right to do so. It seems to us --",
  "Well, it seems to me, Justice Souter, that that conflicts directly with what the Court said in Paul versus Davis, that in the first place, there is not defamation here because it's a truthful imparting of information.",
  "Well, I don't think it is, but -- but even if it were defamation, it is not -- there is no stigma plus, as this Court required in Paul versus Davis. There's no confinement of liberty. There's no denial of any individual on this list of a right to a job --",
  "There may well be.",
  "It -- it -- we submit that that is a minimal, reasonable way for the State to keep track of people who have committed crimes and then --",
  "Yes, they are because the State has made a determination, as have 49 other States and Congress, that the people are entitled to certain public record information. That does not apply --",
  "It's -- well, it is -- it is incomplete information as to everyone, we submit. But it does -- it is complete information with respect to whether individuals have been convicted of a sex crime. That is public information. That is information to which the citizens are entitled. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress and the legislatures of 50 States have agreed that citizens should have access to truthful information concerning the identity and location of convicted sex offenders.",
  "I don't agree with the characterization of this as a megaphone. What I -- what I would characterize it instead of saying it is the least intrusive, most passive way to provide information that is already available to citizens, and can be obtained by citizens, but to make it more accessible to them because the people have decided that they want this information.",
  "Yes, but it's --",
  "But it's -- but it's minimally passive and -- and minimally --",
  "Well, Justice Kennedy, we have to register to vote. We have to register to marry. We have to register to get a driver's license. We have to disclose our homes when we buy a car, when we get a divorce, when we fill out a census form.",
  "Well, the -- that is a separate question. I'm -- what I'm saying is that the burden of registration or of keeping information current is a minimally intrusive burden. Now with respect to the question of shame, that arises, to the extent that it exists at all, from the conviction of violating a sex offense. There is due process in connection with that -- that -- to the extent that process is due -- and we'll get to that I know in the subsequent case, but --",
  "Yes, but that -- that is true of many regulatory measures. You can lose your right to practice in the securities field -- and that's been held -- because of a conviction or to practice banking or the right to vote. There are other consequences. This Court has repeatedly said --",
  "Well, I don't -- I -- I don't -- the Court has never addressed that question, but the Court has held that after the fact, it can -- the -- the legislature can prevent those persons from practicing that profession, including the practice of medicine, being a fund raiser for a union, losing the right to vote. The fact that this -- what the -- this --",
  "Well, the -- well, the fact of registration and disclosure relates to the conviction of a sex offense. The public in 50 States and the legislature and Congress have determined in response to the requests of the people -- as Mr. Roberts said, the test, according to this Court's jurisprudence, is the intent. The intent here is not to punish. The intent is to respond to citizens who have --",
  "Yes. This Court has said that only -- you would go beyond that only if the evidence was the clearest proof, unmistakable evidence that the intent or effect was punitive as opposed to regulatory. In this case, there is no affirmative restraint on motion. There is no confinement. There is no restriction on travel or employment or recreation, no obligation to submit to searches, intrusive supervision or questioning.",
  "Well, the empirical evidence is not great that that is indeed a significant statistical problem, but the problem, to the extent that it may exist, results from the conviction of a -- of an -- of an offense --",
  "-- about which an employer may want to know.",
  "Well, to apply the seven -- to the extent that the Court would apply the Kennedy Mendoza- Martinez factors, there is no affirmative disability or restraint. Registration or publication has never been considered historically as punishment. The -- the -- there is a regulatory purpose. The -- even the Ninth Circuit --",
  "I do not know the answer to that, and perhaps Mr. Roberts does. But what this is -- and I think this is a proper way to think of this statute -- in connection with a class of offenses, where the -- where the rate of recidivism is significantly higher -- as this Court has held very recently -- than any other crime, people are asking their government please allow us to know when we have someone in our neighborhood. When we -- when we're hiring a new --",
  "No, I -- well, I don't know, Justice Kennedy, but I would say that would be considerably different than what's here because that would --",
  "Pardon me?",
  "I -- I respectfully submit that it's a great deal different. That mark on your license plate, or mark on your forehead would go wherever you would go. It would require you to carry the government's message rather than the government supplying the message.",
  "It only -- it doesn't require you to make the government's message four times a year. The government's message, I respectfully submit, is made when a citizen submits an inquiry to the State through the Internet listing. All -- it is required four times a year is to advise the government of a current location or current information so that the information on the registry is accurate and -- and up-to-date. This is information that citizens have requested from their government. Their government has the information of people who have committed certain types of crimes, who society has perceived as particularly dangerous. It's a self-protective mechanism. The -- not only the --",
  "It -- it would seem to -- well, I think the answer is that yes, it would because the Federal statute simply prescribes a floor. It's going to be virtually impossible and quite burdensome for the State to supply what you suggest would be complete information about any individual. What the parents and the --",
  "Well, and that is all that the registry does, and I submit that to the extent that your question goes to any of the seven Kennedy Mendoza-Martinez factors, it's excessiveness is -- on -- on the scale.",
  "And I would submit that this registry and this information, providing truthful, public record, readily accessible information is -- is minimal.",
  "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The right to control a business, whether or not for profit, is a well-recognized and longstanding interest in property. When that control is surrendered in response to unlawful force, whether motivated by economics, politics, or ideals, the extortionist has attained his objective, and the Hobbs Act has been violated.",
  "If --",
  "If there's an unlawful use of force or threats or violence, Justice Kennedy, whether it be in the form of trespassing -- and the aim -- which this Court recognized 8 years ago in this -- in this very predecessor case was to shut down the clinics. If that aim is achieved, the control of the property has been transferred from the owner of those clinics to the extortionist.",
  "As Justice Souter said in -- in the dissent, which you joined, in the earlier case, the First Amendment is not an issue in this case, and it can be dealt with in particular circumstances in particular cases where it arises. The issue here is if the use of force --",
  "Well, it was the question that was presented that was not accepted by this Court. Question 3, I think it was, or 4 in the -- the one Scheidler petition was not accepted by this Court.",
  "I submit, Justice Scalia, that that is not going to be the -- the problem that this Court or any courts are going to have to face. First of all, the definition of property as controlling a business has been accepted for a long time. Now, the only question that is --",
  "Under some circumstances, it could have if illegal force or threats were used to prevent a business from operating.",
  "In many --",
  "Well, they --",
  "This -- this Court specifically carved out an exemption in -- in the Enmons case with respect to legitimate labor objectives --",
  "-- and made it --",
  "What -- what this Court --",
  "Well, I -- I can't pull a specific piece of the language out of the statute, but this Court said nearly 20 times in the Enmons case that the Hobbs Act was not intended to cover achievement of legitimate collective bargaining demands, and because the Court did not want to --",
  "No, it --",
  "I -- I take that the Court, because it said over 15, nearly 20 times legitimate collective bargaining demands, legitimate union objectives --",
  "I -- I can only submit, Justice Scalia, that it seemed to me a clear implication of the words used by the Court and the fact that the Court emphasized that it was -- that we were dealing with -- the Court was dealing with the extraordinary -- the potential extraordinary change in Federal labor law, that that phrase was emphasized over and over again. Neither this Court --",
  "In the -- in the context of the history --",
  "No, not out of nowhere, Justice Scalia. There was a long history of --",
  "What -- what the statute -- what the language of the statute does -- and here's -- here's where -- what I would emphasize. The language of the statute specifically makes it unlawful and makes no exception for -- for whether the -- whether the -- the petitioner -- the -- the protester, or the -- or the alleged extortionist is motivated by ideals or politics or wanting to shut down a business or a -- or a boycott of Israel or -- this is a classic use of force and extortion in the organized crime setting. The use of force or threats to take over a labor union or a business --",
  "Yes.",
  "Let me --",
  "It -- the question, it seems to me, was answered in part by this Court in the earlier NOW case by saying that the extortionist doesn't have to gain a financial benefit or take possession. Now, the -- the robbery and larceny statutes at common law required the taking and acquiring of possession.",
  "That's -- that's part of it, yes. And the answer to the question about obtaining --",
  "Well, there -- there is a stopping point, is whether at the end of the day, through the threats or the -- the actions of the extortionist, that property interest that was held by the victim of the extortion has been transferred to the hands of the extortionist in the sense that the aim has been accomplished. The aim was to shut down the clinics. That was the attempt, and to the extent that that was or was attempted to be accomplished, that control --",
  "We -- we have not addressed that, Justice O'Connor. I do --",
  "I do -- I do agree. I think that it would have to be sent back to the Seventh Circuit for a remand to examine that question. The jury instruction did have the component to which you refer which we would characterize as a liberty interest of a right of an individual. And that was --",
  "I think that -- I think that at the end of the day, although we haven't briefed it and the Government is interested in the definition of extortion, at the end of the day that might have to be the result because the general -- generalized verdict does not make a distinction between that which we contend is property right which was obtained by the extortionist or -- or was attempted to be obtained --",
  "That's -- no, I --",
  "Well, I -- the question presented, in connection with the Hobbs Act, I think is answered this way. Where unlawful -- which this Court should articulate, we hope, in its opinion. Where unlawful force is used to arrest sufficient control of a business to stop the performance of its services, the Hobbs Act has been violated because control of the business, a property right has been acquired. I -- I may have 1 minute left to just mention one thing with respect to the -- the RICO provision. Congress created a private right to damages for RICO violations by intentionally copying language from the antitrust laws that this Court had repeatedly held did not confer a right to seek injunctive relief. This Court has said that Congress was aware of the antitrust history, was copying it, intended to copy it, and was presumed to know the consequences of what Congress was doing.",
  "Section 16.",
  "Well, may I answer that, Justice Stevens?",
  "It seems to me that in the context of the language that the -- that Congress knew would not create a right, and knowing -- Congress knowing that section 16 did specifically create such a right, and knowing that this Court had said that when a right is created and remedies specifically provided, the Court -- the Court will not expand. The Court will accept what Congress has done. And Congress did not adopt and in fact rejected the opportunities or -- or failed to accept the opportunities to adopt precisely the remedy that would have had that result.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Based upon years of experience, study, hearings, and overwhelming persuasive evidence, Congress concluded that the prompt removal of aliens convicted of committing serious felonies was essential to the Nation's ability to control its borders. Detention of these aliens during removal proceedings was considered vital by Congress to effectuate that policy, to prevent flight, to evade removal, and to prevent harm done by recidivist criminal aliens. This is a facial substantive due process challenge which cannot succeed unless there are no sets of -- no set of circumstances under which the congressional policy would be constitutional. As this Court has repeatedly --",
  "Justice Scalia, it's the Government's position, as held by three courts of appeals, that that provision does not apply to a habeas corpus challenge to the constitutionality of the statute itself, that the language of that provision relates to challenges to an action by the Attorney General or administrative action and does not preclude a challenge.",
  "It's -- it's our submission, after careful examination -- the Government originally took that position that you've suggested in court proceedings. It was rejected by three courts of appeals. We studied it further. The Government studied it further and came to the conclusion that those decisions were correct and it would not preclude -- and we're not contending here today --",
  "Well, we're relying on the language that it refers to, and a reasonable construction of the statute refers to actions, administrative actions, by the Attorney General or immigration -- administrative action by administrative officials, and this Court's construction of statutes against precluding constitutional challenges to other statutes.",
  "That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and while it would be in the Government's interest to preclude this challenge at all, we think a fair reading of the Court's decisions, including the -- the Court -- the decision that the Chief Justice mentioned, would to -- would be to construe that statute as not to preclude this action in this case. Of course, that would lead -- your construction would lead to a -- a victory on behalf of the Government in this case, but we've carefully examined it, and we think that we're not advocating that position here today.",
  "Well, we -- we may be --",
  "We -- we may be wrong, Justice Scalia, but we're referring to and relying on the second sentence which says, no court may set aside any action or decision by the Attorney General under this section. It does not state -- and -- and we think the Court would construe it as not precluding a challenge to the constitutionality of the -- of the policy made by the Congress itself in enacting --",
  "I understand, Justice Scalia, and the Government did, indeed, make that assertion, take that position in early proceedings in this case. It was rejected by three courts of appeals. We came to a different conclusion after reexamining it, and that's our position here today. As this Court has repeatedly stated, Congress has exceedingly broad latitude in dealing with aliens, immigration, and the Nation's borders.",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, the -- the case has not been litigated on that basis from its very beginning. I refer the Court to page 9 of the joint appendix which is -- which, at the bottom of that section, articulates the requested relief by the -- by the respondent in this case. Petitioner seeks a declaration that this provision is unconstitutional on its face as violative --",
  "Well --",
  "Well, it --",
  "If this -- not only is it in the petition for habeas corpus that the individual was challenging on its face, the district court considered it on that basis, and the Ninth Circuit considered it on that basis, and it's been litigated here all the way through by the -- by the respondent on that basis. If there was to be an as-applied challenge, there would be a great deal of other considerations. And -- and this -- as this Court has said, the facial challenge must be rejected unless there are no set of circumstances under which the congressional policy would be upheld.",
  "There -- there's been no --",
  "Yes, and the Ninth Circuit -- the Ninth Circuit did say that both on page 6 -- 6a and -- and on page 30a. But what -- what the Ninth Circuit did was issue a broad, sweeping declaration of unconstitutionality of the statute with respect to a broad class of individuals, that is to say, all lawful permanent residents. That's the equivalent of a facial decision as to unconstitutionality as to a broad spectrum of the people covered. And -- and --",
  "Yes, Justice --",
  "That's -- that is correct, Justice O'Connor. That's --",
  "That's correct.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Mostly facial.",
  "That's -- that is what the Ninth Circuit did, and it's our position that this -- this case must be considered under those circumstances as a facial challenge. As I was saying, the Court has repeatedly said that in connection with immigration and protecting the Nation's borders, there is no power at which there is more deference to congressional judgment, no authority under the Constitution granted more to the political branches, particularly to Congress. Congress regularly makes rules, this Court has said, applicable to aliens that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens.",
  "Well, the statute --",
  "Here there was a conviction, and that is specifically what is said in the statute itself. It's my understanding --",
  "Absolutely. And -- and what happens in practice, Justice Kennedy, is that either the removal proceeding is brought, as Congress has suggested, if possible, during the period of incarceration of the individual, or immediately upon release from incarceration. So we were talking, to summarize, a -- this -- this provision under 1226(c) applies only to the period of the removal proceeding itself, which was carefully distinguished by this Court in its Zadvydas decision of 2 years ago. This is on -- compared to that Zadvydas decision, not an unlimited, potentially permanent detention period, what, as the Court suggested in -- in a distinguishable situation a number of years -- years ago in the Carlson case involving members of the Communist Party, a temporary, limited detention for the purpose of keeping the individual in custody, an individual who's had a full panoply of due process, having been convicted beyond a reasonable doubt with full due process of --",
  "It's my understanding, Justice Stevens, that it applies to convictions after the statute was passed. I may be misunderstanding that, and if so, I'll try to correct that during -- during rebuttal. But that to the vast -- that would all -- to the extent that that might be true and I might be mistaken, that would only illustrate why this is a facial challenge. The statute itself should not be declared unconstitutional, particularly in connection with individuals convicted afterwards.",
  "This was after the statute was passed, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Well, I think Justice Souter, the answer to that is that the test that the Court has consistently applied in this area is there -- is there a rational basis, is the congressional objective rationally likely to advance a legitimate governmental purpose. Those statistics that we set forth in our brief and which were before Congress when Congress enacted this statute, provide the purpose for which Congress acted.",
  "Well, under certain circumstances, the Court has used that language.",
  "The -- the means to achieve the objective --",
  "-- will be looked at possibly separately.",
  "But it seems to me -- and it seems obvious particularly in this case -- that the means are wrapped up in the objective itself. What -- it is clear Congress is dealing with a very difficult problem of a certain category or groups of aliens that were committing serious crimes in this country.",
  "Well, it is -- yes, Justice Souter, it's all.",
  "What the statistics tell us is that there were large numbers of aliens committing serious crimes and that those -- those individuals committing those crimes were highly likely to be recidivists and that they were -- that class of individuals or those groups of individuals were cultivating a criminal class that was engaging in organized --",
  "Well --",
  "Well, 80 percent --",
  "Well, the -- the statistics have to be looked at very carefully because that 20 percent -- 20 percent of the --",
  "Well, no.",
  "In that -- that -- well, actually the -- it's -- it's worse than that, Justice Scalia, because that figure of 20 percent who absconded were people that had been, during this period of time, been given individualized hearings. They were the ones that, after a hearing, the authorities thought were probably likely not to flee and 20 percent of that group did. When you look at --",
  "Yes, Justice Souter, but there's no question that there were large numbers of lawful permanent resident aliens that were evading the deportation proceeding itself. Once the deportation --",
  "No. The figure jumped to 40 percent for people who were never detained at all, Justice Stevens, and that's explained in the brief. The 20 percent to which you're referring are people to which an individualized hearing was -- was given. In 1992 alone, we're talking about 11,000 aliens, criminal aliens, who had absconded. And we're not talking just about showing up for the hearing because if that alien isn't in custody, he won't -- and -- and the figure jumps to 90 percent of people that will escape the deportation order itself if there --",
  "I -- I respectfully disagree in this sense, that if you have the alien in custody during the -- the removal period itself, he will be in custody at the time the order is issued.",
  "If he's not, it's very difficult for the Government --",
  "Well, that -- that is not the way the process works, Justice Stevens. There is a potential appeal that the individual can take --",
  "No.",
  "Yes, it is, and the Government -- and the Congress --",
  "Well, but this -- let me answer it this way. That 20 to 40 percent -- and the statistics are difficult in this area. There are such large numbers of individuals. We're talking about 15,000 criminals convicted of serious crimes per year that are -- go through this process. If -- if we're losing 20 -- even 20 percent of those individuals that are absconding from the process and not available for deportation or removal, that is the -- that is what Congress regarded as a very serious problem.",
  "But that 20 percent, Justice Stevens -- and it's explained in the brief. That 20 percent were the individuals for which there had been an individualized hearing given during that period of time when that process was taking place. If you don't have an individualized hearing, of course, the numbers go up higher.",
  "One of the -- one of the problems that Congress had is that it had experimented with that process. It was not being successful. The individuals were absconding notwithstanding --",
  "Well, it -- it appeared -- it appeared to Congress and it appeared to the immigration authorities to be a reasonably tough standard. The problem with criminal aliens is that once -- once they enter this process, once they've been convicted after due process of having committed a serious crime and once they're in that process, which is virtually certain to lead to removal -- I mean, this is -- removal is automatic --",
  "Pardon me?",
  "That's -- that's correct, Justice --",
  "That's -- that's precisely correct.",
  "If -- no. If you have a -- if you as --",
  "-- and I think it's on page -- pages 26 and 27 of the Government's brief sets forth the -- the regulations of the -- of the Immigration and Naturalization Service that provide that you may have an immediate hearing if it is not you, if you are a citizen, if you contend that you didn't -- weren't convicted of a crime --",
  "It's my understanding that what happens is that there's an immediate, or a relatively prompt individualized hearing. I'm not positive of the answer to that question, but there is the hearing that the Ninth Circuit talked about --",
  "-- an individualized hearing, which -- which would have applied all the way across the board --",
  "-- in those cases under those regulations.",
  "Well, we're -- I'm not quarrelling with your characterization of what --",
  "No. No, Justice --",
  "No. I'm simply --",
  "This -- we may well be here on another occasion defending a broader policy. But let me emphasize the facts that distinguish what you're suggesting and what the Court considered in the Zadvydas case, an immense difference that exists between the circumstances here, and the circumstances under those circumstances.",
  "The statute makes no distinction. The Ninth Circuit, of course, did with respect to excludable aliens, said that with that category of aliens, the statute -- even under the Ninth Circuit's reasoning, the statute was constitutional. What we -- the statute doesn't make that distinction, but what it does do is it provides for a brief, limited detention, which is not unlimited and not potentially permanent, of aliens, an area of Congress' authorities at its zenith, convicted beyond a reasonable doubt with --",
  "That's the question that I believe I addressed earlier that's referred to, the regulations -- and I hope I'm correct -- at pages 26 and 27 of the Government's brief. The -- the regulations provide for someone claiming who is claiming that they are a citizen as opposed to an alien, or claiming that the crime for which they've been convicted was not a covered crime, may -- may have an accelerated hearing, which is -- which is --",
  "That -- that is correct.",
  "What they are is what -- they are -- they are lawful resident aliens until there's an order of deportation, but --",
  "They -- however, they have -- they have been convicted after due process of a crime that Congress considers serious, and they're being held for a limited period of time --",
  "That's correct.",
  "That's correct, Justice Scalia.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, if -- if I may reserve the remainder --",
  "No. Now, we haven't briefed and studied that and -- and I have to rely on the answer that I gave before. But I think that that would be a correct with -- it would be within the power of Congress to do that under certain circumstances.",
  "Well, then I would've have to answer the question differently. Well, if -- I guess no, I guess I would -- that -- that's a good answer. Let me -- let me --",
  "Let me just deal with a few things that were raised during my colleague's argument. First of all, the date of the offense that's involved in this case was after the enactment of this statute. On page 8 of the respondent's brief, it is asserted that he was convicted of petty theft with priors and sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment in 1997. That was when that conviction took place. Secondly -- and I think a lot of time has been expended with respect to the question that focused in large part by Justice Breyer. What happens if it's not the individual? What happens if he's really a citizen? What happens if he wants to challenge whether this crime was one that should be covered? As we said on page 26 -- and we cite the relevant provision of the INS regulations -- those types of things can be challenged in an individualized bond hearing at which the -- which is what the Ninth Circuit was talking about and which is what our opponents are talking about here, and that those issues may be raised at that point, which is precisely what the respondents are talking about. So that's already built into the statute. Now, one might quarrel with whether -- what the burden of proof is, and where it should be and how it should be written, but that's a -- this is a determination by the executive branch with respect to the statute. If the alien can show that the INS is substantially unlikely to prevail on its underlying charge of removability, then the individual may be released on bond. If the decision goes against the individual, that can be taken to the Board of Immigration Appeals. So there's a process that takes care of precisely those -- that category 2, as you put it. Now, that does not deal with the question of dangerousness or risk of flight, but that's what Congress was concerned about when it -- when it enacted the statute. Congress was concerned about a situation in which large numbers of individuals who commit serious crimes -- and Congress went to the effort of define what it thought -- defining what it thought was serious crimes. Now, if there is some question about that in an individual case, or if there's some question about an aberrational lengthy detention, that should be brought to this Court or the courts below in an as-applied challenge. The respondent is saying here today that this is an as-applied challenge, but that has never been the way this case has been litigated from the petition, which I cited as a facial challenge, through the district court's decision to the -- to the as -- the -- the facial challenge in part of the decision of the Ninth Circuit. This has been a challenge to the congressional determination that people who commit serious crimes are to -- to be deportable as rapidly as possible. They -- and -- and to the -- in order for that policy to be effectuated, for our borders to be protected, to avoid the acculturation of a criminal alien class in the United States that's operating freely, for a limited period of time, that individual will be detained during that process until the final order of deportation is entered. 85 percent of the aliens that are brought into these procedures don't even challenge the immigration decision -- immigration judge decision, and more than half of those cases are resolved within 30 days. The statistics are in the brief.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When libraries block Internet pornography from their computer terminals, they are simply declining to put onto their computer screens the same content they have traditionally excluded from their bookshelves. By offering Internet access without pornography, freedom of speech is expanded, not abridged. Under the Children's Internet Protection Act, or CIPA, no Internet speech is prohibited, inhibited, threatened, or chilled. Libraries are simply exercising their discretion as to the content that their libraries will contain, the historic discretion to exercise that -- that authority, and to how their library resources will be used.",
  "No. Shall I wait until you've asked --",
  "It's my understanding that the -- the library patron would not have to explain any reason why he was asking a site to be unblocked or the filtering to be disabled.",
  "The library patron, if the patron is an adult, can ask the -- the entire filtering to be disabled, and the library may disable -- I mean, eliminate the filtering with respect to specific sites either on their own or at the request of a patron.",
  "I think that it is -- it is -- the record is not clear on that, and I -- but my -- my experience and my judgment in connection with our preparation is that it need not be a very difficult thing. It's something that libraries can do without a great deal of difficulty. But to the extent that it took any time at all, it would be the same as asking for a book that is not on the shelf or asking for an inter-library loan, the kind of customary things that library patrons do when they ask for a book or a resource in a library.",
  "If I understand your question correctly, I -- I know of nothing in the statute that would prohibit the library from doing that, provided that the -- the person asks and the patron asking is an adult. The First Amendment does not require libraries to sponsor the viewing of pornography. When Government gives financial aid to speech on Government premises, it may make rational choices as to what not to finance. Those -- that -- that doctrine is consistent with this Court's previous decisions. In connection with this particular content, Congress and this Court have found that Government has -- the Government has a compelling interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity, child pornography, and in the case of minors, material that is harmful to children. Such material has been traditionally excluded from public libraries, and Government has a basic, fundamental right in addition not to associate with or finance pornography.",
  "Justice Souter, that is -- that is true that any system is going to involve some over- blocking and under-blocking because it's impossible to know what is going to be coming over the Internet or impossible to make systems that are perfect. But that's consistent with what -- the historical decisions that libraries have made.",
  "Well --",
  "It's -- there's several answers to that it seems to me. In the first place, libraries have known that they have not stocked pornography, and it's not because of space, popularity, or expense. They have chosen traditionally not to stock that type of material. Every time a library decides not to subscribe to a magazine, it is over-blocking in a sense. A magazine may have three pornographic pictures in it or sexually explicit pictures in --",
  "It knows what the magazine has been. It may not know what the magazine is in the future. Furthermore, librarians don't read every book.",
  "Yes, but it can -- it can test this -- what we're saying here with respect to that is over- blocking or under-blocking is a necessary part of the library function of making appropriateness judgments with respect to content generally. That's the type of distinction --",
  "Yes. And, Justice Kennedy, it seems to -- it seems to the Government and it seemed -- it seemed to Congress that gross judgments are going to have to be made. These libraries, as the record reflects and the findings of the district court reveal, traditionally or -- or customarily block e-mail, chat, gambling, gaming, dating services, and some of them, as reflected -- I think it's on page 37, 38 of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement -- make -- make judgments with respect to what's appropriate, what's offensive. Those types of judgments are being made. Yes, this is a new medium and it's --",
  "No, that -- Mr. Chief Justice, that's our point. This is a difference in quantity, but it is not a difference generically from what libraries traditionally have done.",
  "Well, in a specific situation, a library might know that. A library might decide that it would just stock history books or just stock -- stock novels of a particular period. There's nothing to suggest that libraries don't have the right to make those decisions and customarily make those decisions.",
  "Well, that's right, but the traditional decisions that libraries have made -- and the appellees do not dispute this -- is that libraries have not chosen to stock the types of material on their shelves that they're now being asked to keep out with respect to the Internet. This is a similar decision with a different medium.",
  "But, Justice Souter, they -- they may on their own -- there's a -- there's -- one of the materials that's in the record is someone that made a study of several hundred thousand sites and decided which ones were properly blocked or improperly blocked. Those types of studies may be used to unblock sites, to modify the filtering system. Libraries could get together and create their own filtering system rather than the ones that are --",
  "Well, I -- I believe that the answer is that, A, the librarian can, in response to a request from a patron, unblock the filtering mechanism altogether. And secondly, I think it's not entirely -- it's not -- the statute doesn't get into it, but it -- but it seems entirely consistent with what I've just said, and I think consistent with the import of your question is that the library staff can disable the filter in order to make judgments about whether something has been, quote, properly or improperly blocked.",
  "I -- I was answering your question with respect to what the staff may review in making the administrative decisions with respect to unblocking or other decisions with respect to the implementation of the statute. The statute speaks in terms of having in place this technological mechanism by which this material can be filtered out or is designed and calculated to do that. It doesn't -- the statute does not require perfection. It doesn't require librarians to act in --",
  "With respect to that patron. I mean, the -- the -- if my answer suggested that the library could just switch off the filter on a daily basis, I didn't mean to say anything remotely like that.",
  "It -- this -- particular patrons may say, I'm investigating breast cancer. This -- the sites -- some of the sites that I'm looking for I can't find, and they appear to be on block. Can those sites -- or I've heard about these sites -- be unblocked?",
  "That's -- that's correct. Yes, that's correct.",
  "That -- that may happen, Justice Scalia. The system is not perfect. It is not going to be perfect. But what it does, it's a reasonable, rational articulation by Congress of an attempt to decide --",
  "Well, I think that is -- again, is a practical judgment that may work in some libraries. It might require a great deal more resources from librarians. It might require establishing different screens and mechanisms. Yes, there are ways in which Congress could have done this differently, but this is a rational judgment, consistent with --",
  "I think that the -- my answer to your question, if I understand it correctly, is that the computers in the library, if the library uses the -- the Federal funds with either respect to the discounts or the subsidies, direct subsidies, all the computers in that library must be equipped with the technology protection measure with respect to each of those computers.",
  "Yes. But that does not preclude the staff from determining, in connection with specific requests --",
  "Well --",
  "Well, one could -- you're in an area, it seems to me, that -- where there might be an as- applied challenge. We're talking about a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the statute.",
  "I -- I understand that. I -- and the -- your -- the import of your question suggests that in this situation a librarian might exercise this discretion with respect to a filter. I don't think in the first place --",
  "My answer to your question is that to the extent that librarians are disabling the filter for the performance of their administrative function --",
  "I don't think so, Justice Souter.",
  "That's right. But remember, this is in the context of -- of material that's been traditionally excluded by libraries, that libraries are free to put on their shelves in the form of books anytime they want. It -- the -- the position of the district court and the position of the appellees is that the libraries, by doing this, violate the First Amendment right of their patrons. I don't think that would be an issue in that context, and we're suggesting that the patrons have a right to Internet access anywhere they want outside the federally subsidized library. And the library has several choices it may make here. The library might not have Internet. Maybe it's not appropriate for that particular library. The library may have Internet with the filtering and accept Federal money with respect to putting in the computers. Or the library --",
  "I -- I think they could. They could either have a separate branch where separate Federal funds are not being obtained, or you're talking about a separate administrative ability --",
  "-- facility. I don't -- I don't believe that the statute would prohibit that set of operations.",
  "Yes, it would, Justice Stevens, although --",
  "Because it's a reasonable condition to the operation of the funds. In the first place, Justice Stevens, in -- the Internet is going to come through one opening, and the -- the various different computers will be plugged up to that one opening so that the -- the technological answer in part to your question is it's -- the -- the library would have to decide --",
  "Yes, the library could do that sort of thing, but it would --",
  "Yes, it would. Yes, it would.",
  "We believe that it's a reasonable condition that Congress reasonably -- the patrons may not be able to distinguish where the --",
  "Well, again, as we said in our briefs, that to the extent that that is an issue, it should be made -- that point should be made in a -- in an as-applied challenge to the statute, as opposed to a challenge on the face. We don't think it's technologically going to be a problem and we do think that Congress can reasonably have assumed we're using Federal money to finance Internet in this library. Patrons are going to be exposed. If you're going to take the money, we would like patrons not to be exposed in this manner to that material, and the Congress could well have decided that it -- the taxpayers don't want to be associated with a subsidy of that types of material -- that type of material which has traditionally been excluded from the libraries in any event.",
  "I -- well, I think that that would be a reasonable choice for Congress to make.",
  "Well, with respect to all of the computers in the library in -- in that narrow context, yes, but I do think that that's the -- we're getting down to the refinements of particular applications and those types of challenges have not yet been made.",
  "I believe that that's -- that's -- well, child pornography would also be excluded. Both obscenity and child pornography --",
  "-- there are Federal criminal statutes with respect to both of those. And -- and again, this is a reasonable effort by the library -- by the Congress to make rational decisions with respect to allowing for some escape for people who are doing research or for other appropriate purposes.",
  "Well, I -- I agree with that, but --",
  "If -- if -- excuse me, Justice Scalia.",
  "The -- the --",
  "The statute put it in terms of bona fide research or other lawful purposes. That -- there's bound to be some interpretive -- given the joints there. And again, to the extent that that would trigger a funding decision with respect to the enforcement authority or something, that's appropriately raised in an as-applied challenge. I think it's important to stress the converse of what the appellees are asking for here. They're asking this Court to make a judgment that the First Amendment prohibits them from exercising the discretion to make that kind of choice with respect to the Internet that they've always made or traditionally made with respect to the books on their shelf. The consequence of that, it seems to me, would be strict scrutiny applicable to librarians' judgments with respect to not just the Internet, but microfilm, television, other medium that might -- other media that might come into the library, and that librarians, instead of spending money on books, are going to be spending money on lawyers defending cases brought by authors saying, you -- you violated my First Amendment right not to have strict scrutiny, and that instead of librarians making these --",
  "Well, it might be if the decision was written that way, Justice Stevens, but if -- if the appellees are right, the types of decisions that librarians have been making, appropriateness is -- is the word, quality, appropriateness, and appropriate decisions -- it's -- it's in the record. Those types of decisions the librarians are saying -- asking this Court to say are subject to strict scrutiny and violate the Constitution. This Court would have to make a First Amendment distinction between the selection of a book and the selection of another source of information.",
  "Justice Scalia -- I mean, Justice Souter --",
  "I think I was expecting the next question.",
  "Nothing is being --",
  "Nothing is being required of the library. The library, if it chooses --",
  "If it wants to. But the case comes to this Court in the posture that the district court has held and the appellees are arguing that for the library voluntarily to make that choice on their own, irrespective of any Federal Government subsidy or anything, would violate the First Amendment rights of their patrons.",
  "Well, the -- the testimony was varied, Justice O'Connor. One of the -- one of the findings of the district court was that tens of thousands of pages of material may be erroneously blocked. Now, the problem with that is that different filters might block different things. Sites may be unblocked. The filter may be set aside. But even if it's tens of thousands of the -- of the 2 billion pages of material that is on the Internet, we're talking about one two-hundredths of 1 percent, even if it's 100,000, of materials would be blocked. If it -- if it please the Court, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "I would like to invite the Court's attention to page 37a of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement which is the decision of the court below. In the first full paragraph, the court found approximately 95 percent of libraries with public Internet access have some form of acceptable use policy or Internet use policy governing patrons' use of the Internet. Now, what the libraries are saying here is the exercise of certain discretion violates the First Amendment rights of their patrons, and therefore every time they exercise that type of discretion in this context, they're subject to strict scrutiny. What this statute does is gives the libraries the right, if they choose to accept Federal funds, to make what kind of decisions, to exclude pornography which there's no dispute in the record libraries have, from time immemorial, chosen not to put in their libraries. So the decision that they're making is the same one they have already voluntarily made over the years. It would inhibit their decisions to exclude e-mail, chat, gambling, dating services, and the other things that this part of the court below's decision held that they are doing already. It's the traditional type of discretion that libraries have exercised with respect to whether they be -- want to be a fiction library or a library that's specializing in this or that or technology or anything along those lines. So the type of discretion that the librarians are saying violate their First Amendment rights are the types of discretion precisely that they've been exercising for years.",
  "I -- we have no problem if the Court decides it, although it wasn't briefed and it wasn't the decision below, but we don't think it's remotely possible for this Court to decide that question in this context against the Government. If -- if the libraries are right, they're saying they don't have a First -- they can't have it both ways. They don't have a First Amendment right to make this discretion -- discretionary decision with respect to their -- the -- the materials in their library, and then they turn around and say, allowing us to make that is an unconstitutional -- or giving us an incentive to make that very decision is an unconstitutional condition. This is a condition that's connected with libraries' traditional decisions. It's in an area where the Government -- the Congress of the United States and this Court has said the Government has a compelling governmental interest already. It's a condition to the use of the funds. This is not extracting from libraries some separate, unconnected decision. It's connected with the actual use of the funds. And it does not say that libraries may not stock pornography. If they want to abandon the years of tradition of not stocking pornography on their bookshelves or in some other form, movies, whatever it might be, they can still do that without violating this condition. So the libraries have plenty of choices. They can not accept the public money. They can accept the public money and use it in -- in the way that Congress decided, which is consistent with their traditional exercise of discretion. There's many distinguishing factors between this case and the cases in -- in which the Court has exercised -- expressed some concern with respect to the First Amendment issues here. It is not -- this case is not a regulation of speech, but the actions of a Government acting in a proprietary capacity -- a library to make its own decisions, deciding what to subsidize, what speech to have in that library, what speech not to have in that library. The Government is merely -- is making a content decision, not a viewpoint decision. There's no contention that there's a viewpoint decision. The type of decision that they say is being forced upon them, which is actually voluntary, is the same type of decision that libraries -- librarians customarily make. The Federal statute and the library policy that they're complaining about expands information, it doesn't contract information. And this Court said in the Arkansas Educational Television case, a jurisprudence that would result in the constriction of speech, rather than the expansion of speech, would be a repression of First Amendment rights. If Congress can't put this condition --",
  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The Michigan law school admissions program fails every test this Court has articulated for evaluating governmental racial preferences. First, it is --",
  "Well, I'm not sure --",
  "I understand -- the -- our position with respect to that is we respect the opinions of those individuals, but the position of the United States is that we do not accept the proposition that black soldiers will only fight for -- black officers or the reverse that race neutral means should be used in the academies as well as other places. And that to the extent that there's any difference in analysis, the Court might consider its position, the position it articulated in connection with the military in Rostker v. Goldberg. But our position with respect to that brief is that --",
  "No, I'm suggesting that --",
  "Yes, I'm suggesting that the Court will want to look at each of these individual situations according to the circumstances and that may be a factor in that context. But I started my answer, Justice Stevens, by saying you do not accept the proposition that race neutral means should not be used and employed fully to -- to make sure that the academies are accessible and open and -- and offer opportunities for as many people as possible.",
  "The Coast Guard does not. It's prohibited by Congress from doing so. I do acknowledge, Justice Ginsburg that the other academies are doing so. It's the position of the United States --",
  "Pardon me?",
  "We haven't examined that and we haven't presented a brief with respect to the specifics of each individual academy. And we would want to take into consideration any potential impact suggested by the Court in the Rostker case.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, there are a variety of race neutral means and narrowly tailored methods by which academies and universities can reach out to people of all backgrounds to make sure that they've eliminated --",
  "Not limited, a race neutral system of broad scale recruiting that this Court has always supported the proposition that efforts may be made by governmental institutions to eliminate barriers that have existed where artificial barriers --",
  "That is the opinion of certain individuals. It is -- we do not accept that conclusion based upon those opinions. And this Court has repeatedly held that race neutral means must be demonstrated and will be accepted, and will not -- and the Court will not accept the proposition that race neutral means will not be successful unless they've been attempted and demonstrated. These -- this program at the University of Michigan Law School fails every one of the Court's tests. First, it's a thinly disguised quota which sets aside a significant portion of each year's entering class for preferred ethnic groups. Secondly, it overtly employs stigmatizing and divisive racial stereotypes, what the law school calls diversity-relevant characteristics. It identifies persons by diversity-relevant characteristics.",
  "Exactly.",
  "Well, a response to those many arguments is that they've -- they're using stereotypes to in an effort, they say to break down stereotypes, they're using race as a -- a surrogate for experience. And if they want to look at experience, they can look at experience. If they want to improve the educational opportunities of minority groups, one of the biggest problems --",
  "But that person -- that person if he went to Exeter and he has a great GPA and so forth gets an extra opportunity either a portion of the class is set aside for that individual solely on the basis of race, irrespective of his experience. And the -- and the application isn't examined for the type of experience or the type of viewpoint that race-diversity characteristic is used as a substitute for any examination of the individual on the individual.",
  "We disagree with that approach in the sense that we -- we -- in the first place, contrary to what our opponents have said, we would not believe that that single opinion, which was the only opinion, to examine the issue of diversity under a compelling argument --",
  "We're reluctant to say never, Justice O'Connor. But this test -- every test that Justice Powell applied in that opinion, the law school program here fails. It's a stereotype.",
  "I don't disagree with that.",
  "I'm suggesting that the programs here, without getting to the point of whether are there any other circumstances whether they be remedial, which this Court -- a factor of the Court has recognized before, or something else in an unusual situation, where it could be appropriate. I don't know what that might be. But this test --",
  "I would also say that it's conceivable if you're constructing -- the National Institutes of Health is constructing this study of diseases that focus on particular races, the race may be a factor but the fact is that the law school program here, not only is a set aside and a quota, but it -- but it -- --",
  "No, the Harvard program A wasn't examined according to to any compelling governmental interest. It was examined only --",
  "We would not based upon any what we see in that opinion, which is --",
  "Well, the only way to answer that Justice Kennedy is that the word diversity means so many things to so many different people. It means both a means to get experience and a diversity of experience. It also means, I think what the law school has done, it's an end in and of itself. If it's an end in and of itself, obviously it's constitutionally objectable that this Court --",
  "Justice Breyer, I don't believe that that is the stated motive of the Texas plan or the California or the Florida plan. Those are intended to open up those institutions to a broader selection, one of the ways in which this Court has accepted the institution such as universities may operate is to make sure that barriers are broken down, accessibility is made more available and that is one very race neutral means of accomplishing that legitimate objective.",
  "No, there is no evidence that it depends upon segregation of the schools in Texas or in any other place. It is a diverse selection of the high schools in that state.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The University of Michigan admissions program has created a separate path and a separate door for preferred minorities. For those groups, if they meet basic qualifications, their path is always clear and their door is always open. Non-preferred racial groups face rigorous competition to get through the other door. The University admits that race is such an overarching factor in its admissions process that eventually every qualified underrepresented minority applicant will be admitted. The 20 point bonus, which is one full grade point, nearly twice the benefit of a perfect SAT score, and six times better than an outstanding essay, the -- that bonus is actually unnecessary with the way the plan actually works, because every qualified candidate who gets the bonus gets into the University. It might just as well be an admissions ticket. The University acknowledges that its pre-1999 admissions program used separate grids, separate qualifications, separate standards and protected seats. They acknowledge that this system was -- which was held unconstitutional and was not challenged, yet they stipulated that the only changes that they made from that system affected only the mechanics, not the substance of how race and ethnicity were considered in the admissions process.",
  "Notwithstanding the fact that the -- the University -- we -- we respectfully disagree with that conclusion, because the -- the University itself admitted that it only changed the mechanics. It intended to produce the same --",
  "We submit Justice Souter, that the changes which they referred to as mechanics were cosmetics, that ultimately, the system was intended to, and they acknowledge, to produce the same outcome as the prior system.",
  "Correct, Justice Kennedy. And what the Court only needs to look at the operation of the system. That 20 point bonus means that if you pass the minimum qualification standards at the University of Michigan, you were admitted. Everyone else just like in the Davis program, had to compete -- people that were not in the preferred races, who were not on the preferred class had to compete with one another.",
  "Yes, Justice Ginsburg.",
  "Yes, and you couldn't get both. But if you had -- whether -- whatever your background, whether you were an athlete or not, you got the 20 points solely because of your race. There were other systems, that the Constitution doesn't implicate.",
  "That's correct.",
  "That's correct. But if you -- irrespective of those other factors, if you didn't get the -- the 20 point bonus for being an athlete or -- for socioeconomic conditions, the only thing that was required was to be a member of the preferred race. Like the other program that we're hearing today, the same State, the state Board of Regents, this plan violates every standard that this Court has set for the examination of racial preferences. It is a thinly disguised quota because there's only one path, a segment -- Justice O'Connor put it this way in Croson -- a segment of the class reserved exclusively for certain minority groups. It isn't tied to a particular number. It's a segment of the class reserved on the basis of race. It is -- it is based upon the stigmatizing notion that if you are a certain race, you think a certain way or if you're a certain race, you have certain experience that's are common.",
  "What we're saying is that if you assume that because you are white or you are red or you are brown or you are black, you must have certain experiences and you must have certain viewpoints.",
  "Well, but Justice Stevens --",
  "-- that's a self-contradictory rationale that they've come up with. They've said first of all you have these characteristics because you're black but we must admit enough of you into the class to prove to the other students that -- that black isn't the reason you're --",
  "Well, their argument, A, takes several forms, at one point it's that, at one point, it's the need to get more people elite -- of different backgrounds, it's a -- but what this Court has said that racial preferences, racial stereotyping, which it is, is stigmatizing, it's divisive, it's damaging to the fabric of society, it's damaging to the goal ultimately to eliminate the problems that racial discrimination and racial differences have created.",
  "I submit, Justice Ginsburg that none of those countries has our history, none of those countries has the Fourteenth Amendment, none of those histories has the history of the statements by this Court which has examined the question over and over again that the ultimate damage that is done by racial preferences is such that if there ever is a situation in which such factors must be used that they must be -- race neutral means must be used to accomplish those objective, narrow tailoring must be applied, and this -- this -- these programs fail all of those tests.",
  "There --",
  "Sadly, I believe that that is correct, Justice Scalia, and let me conclude by saying that the Michigan Law School and the University of Michigan ultimately must make a choice. It may maintain its elitist, as it refers to it, selection process without regard to race, or it may achieve the racial diversity it seeks with race neutral compromises in its admission standards. But the one thing that it may not do is compromise its admission standards or change its admission requirements for one race and not another. That is forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.",
  "It may well be Justice Stevens. We're not defending the specifics of those programs, but we have not examined them individually. We -- we believe that the ultimate solution to the problem that race has created -- that difference in race has created in this country has got to be according to what this Court has said, the most neutral race -- neutral means possible.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: California has transferred its governmental authority to regulate marketplace communications to anyone and everyone who possesses the price of the filing fee. Unelected, unaccountable private enforcers, uninhibited by established notions of concrete harm or public duty, have the power to advance their own agendas or personal ideological battles by launching complex, burdensome, and expensive litigation. The in terrorem effect and potential for abuse is difficult to overstate. This case can and should, we submit, be evaluated according to the means used to regulate speech in California, not the content of that speech. The Court and several of the Justices on this Court have explicitly and repeatedly acknowledged that it is exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to draw bright lines that segregate marketplace speech according to its content into two separate, mutually exclusive hemispheres, commercial and not commercial. These issues arise in an infinite array of contexts. The speakers are imaginative and creative, and rigid, permanent, constitutional categorization is neither advisable nor necessary. If the commercial-noncommercial dichotomy is employed in this case, and in others, either alternative has undesirable consequences. Valuable marketplace speech -- and this Court has repeatedly stressed that speech in the marketplace of commerce is valuable. It's valuable to consumers, but either it becomes noncommercial, making it difficult for Government to regulate to protect the integrity of the marketplace, or it then is characterized as commercial, which can open the day -- open the way to regimes such as California's, where anyone with a whim or a grievance and a filing fee can become a Government-licensed censor.",
  "Yes, Justice O'Connor, with respect to concrete harm in connection with specific individuals. First place, Article III would require that, that there actually be concrete harm, an individual participating in a transaction. This Court has held with respect to 10(b)(5) -- Rule 10(b)(5), for example, that there must be a buyer or seller of security.",
  "Yes, it is, Justice Breyer. It will limit -- first of all it will limit the regulation of marketplace speech to the traditional patterns and the regimes that have existed --",
  "Yes.",
  "If -- well, if -- there are other problems with the California statute in terms of its breadth and its vagueness and things of that nature, but the principal problem that we're talking about here, which avoids the problem of saying that everything is either commercial or noncommercial, is that traditionally, for hundreds of years, the -- the private individual who has suffered that injury has been able to bring an action.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, in the first place, there -- there is the Article III requirement of actual, concrete harm suffered by an individual. There are hundreds of years of common law tradition with respect to allowing an individual who is the -- who has received in some way a material misrepresentation of fact, which your question presupposes, that -- that causes justifiable reliance in the marketplace and actual harm as a result of that conduct. Now, with respect to whether that individual, who can then recover the damage actually suffered, can go on and then seek some sort of institutional injunctive or equitable relief, the courts over the years, over hundreds of years have developed circumstances under which the remedy in the injunctive suit, or in the equitable action, has to be tailored to the actual harm suffered by the individual.",
  "Our principle, Chief Justice Rehnquist, is that the governmental power to regulate speech in the marketplace, which is constrained by the First Amendment, has been transferred to private citizens without the normal constraints that -- that --",
  "Well, one of the --",
  "The -- well, I think that I have to start with the Gertz case, in which the -- the Supreme Court said in the context of a libel suit there is a governmental interest in protecting individuals from actual injury suffered, but the Court went on in Gertz to say, but that's the limit of the --",
  "Well, we believe it does, Justice Ginsburg. Those kind of suits, persons who bought one share who were misled in the marketplace, or one pair of shoes who had received misleading information, has been actually suffered, eliminates the idea that governmental power is being transferred to people in gross, that the license to be Government, to regulate speech, is just turned loose to everyone. These are traditional notions of who gets into court and under what circumstances. Act --",
  "Let me answer it this way. This Court has said in Yee versus Escondido that if the legal argument is embraced within the question actually properly raised, the litigants can make that argument. It also discussed that same issue in the Lebron case. This --",
  "That is a requirement, and it's addressed in the appendix in -- in the reply brief and in the appendix to the reply brief filed on behalf of -- of Nike, but it's also important to recognize that this specific point is raised in the -- in the cert petition itself. On pages 27 and 28 Nike said, made the point, other features of the California liability scream -- scheme aggravate the chilling effect, and then goes on to elaborate on that point by saying, it invests every single California resident with the power of a Private Attorney General, so --",
  "That's -- that's correct, Justice Ginsburg, but -- and -- and Mr. Tribe says that it was raised to a certain extent below. I can't answer that question. I can say it was embraced within the question presented, it was raised in the cert petition, it is a -- it is an antecedent question for deciding the First Amendment issue in this case, and it is -- it is an issue that California courts have been dealing with for many years. For many, many years the California courts have talked about and considered whether this any person provision is proper. Let me -- I -- I've --",
  "Thank you.",
  "Well, we believe it could, Mr. Chief justice, but let me come back to that. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issues the Court considers today, every single one of them in connection with Title I, are not new. For a century, with the overwhelming support of the public, Congress has struggled to curb the corrupting influence of corporate, union and large, unregulated contributions in Federal elections. Time and time again, this Court has agreed that achievement of that goal is critical to avoid erosion of public confidence in representative government to -- and I'm using the Court's words -- to a disastrous extent. But concentrated wealth is nothing if not creative. As this Court has observed, the history of campaign finance reform has been a cycle of legislation followed by the invention and exploitation of loopholes, followed by more legislation to cut off the most egregious evasions and circumventions.",
  "Well, this Court hasn't found every problem to be solvable.",
  "Of course not.",
  "Of course, Justice Scalia.",
  "Of course it is.",
  "Of course it is.",
  "Of course it is, but this Court has said over and over again, not only is it a critical problem that's fundamental to the integrity of our election system, but that the solutions that the legislature has enacted before, the central principles of which are embodied in BCRA, are constitutional solutions to that problem.",
  "What Congress has done is read the decisions of this Court from 1976, and including the earlier decisions, that specifically said and have said over and over again, that the regulations of contributions, contributions where you're talking about contributions, not expenditures. This Court has said the regulations of contributions to the Federal election process by unions and by corporations may be controlled by Congress in Federal legislation, in connection with Federal elections. This Court has said that over and over again. And this Court said in Buckley --",
  "This law, referring to Title I, makes certain contributions illegal to the Federal -- to the national parties and to their conduits and surrogates. Contributions from unions, corporations in excess of certain limits. Of course it says that once it said that the contribution is illegal, the solicitation of the contribution is comparably illegal. And the expenditure of that contribution, not any amount of money that the Federal or state committees might want to spend, but the use of that money from that source in excess of those limits.",
  "Of course not, Mr. Chief Justice. What this Court has said over and over again, that Congress can regulate contributions from corporations -- the treasuries of corporations and unions. Separate segregated funds still exist so that those contributions from members can be made, and that Congress can regulate the amount of those contributions. That's all that Title I of BCRA does. And that's -- all three of those aspects were addressed by this Court in Buckley and have been addressed again and again and again.",
  "In fact, Buckley did regulate the amount of the contributions by corporations and unions and in excess of certain levels to parties as well. There was not only a 1,000 contribution limit to the candidate, but there were limitations in Buckley with respect to the amount of expenditures that an individual might make in consultation or coordination with a candidate and there were aggregate limits with respect to the $25,000 limit that was set for the precise reason, this Court explained, to avoid circumvention of the limits in connection with the --",
  "Yes, Justice Scalia. The aggregate contribution by parties and the Court talked in terms of the aggregate contributions that could be made all together by the individual, and the court specifically talked about that, that $25,000 limit was for the very purpose of preventing the individual to circumvent the contribution limit to a candidate by giving money to the party which would then be given to the same candidate, and the court specifically said in Buckley that that would be unearmarked money that would go to the party, which would then go to the candidate.",
  "A contribution, Justice Kennedy. I don't think I understand the question, because the court specifically talked in terms of the corrupting influence of corporate union and uncontrolled large money contributions and what this Court said then and has said over and over again that Congress can attempt to avoid circumvention of those permissible limits. Now, Mr. Starr spoke a moment ago about the lavish evidence of abuses that were set out and reported in the Thompson report. Among those evidence of abuses is that enormous amounts of so-called soft money, which is just another way of saying money that is prohibited to go to Federal elections, was going to Federal elections through various surrogates, through the national party.",
  "The evidence --",
  "What the evidence, if I understand your question correctly, is that the money was going from, through the national parties and at the direction of the national parties to the state subordinate committees in order to fund various activities that had to do with Federal elections, and that's what, they were --",
  "No, that was not what Congress was concerned about. Congress was concerned --",
  "The -- the ban -- no. In the sense that the state parties can raise un -- money that's not regulated, provided that it's not used in conjunction with Federal election activity. So in that sense, the states are free to continue to do that and spend all they wish.",
  "Well, it is, it is broadly defined, but it has been defined by the experts in this country on elections, the corruption of big money, the regulation and the potential abuses. This Court has previous said over and over again, this is an area where there is special expertise in Congress. This legislation --",
  "Well, let me put it this way. The incumbents were doing very well under the existing system, 98.5 percent of the members of Congress, the congressional, the House of Representatives that ran for re-election in 2002 were re-elected.",
  "Well, apparently not. The evidence also shows that's in the record --",
  "Well, the evidence is that the can -- the candidates --",
  "No. The answer to --",
  "Justice Scalia --",
  "Let me -- let me -- there are several answers to that. One, this Court's --",
  "There are several answers to that question. First of all, that very issue was addressed in 1976 in Buckley and the court said that the rules are applying equally to anybody running for office, and in that circumstance, the court will look to evidence of invidious discrimination against challengers. There is no evidence of invidious discrimination against challengers. Number two, the evidence supports overwhelmingly that incumbents were able to get re-elected under the old system just fine and that overwhelming amount of evidence is not in the record, in the testimony below, which is summarized in, in various different sources that the repeated testimony by Senator Thompson, Senator McCain, former Senator Simon and over and over again abuses in the system that were not benefiting incumbents but were tearing down faith of the American people in a system of government and making people believe that the more money that you put in, to use the words of one individual, the White House is like a subway. You have to put money in the turnstiles.",
  "Justice Scalia, the evidence shows and the Federal Election Commission came out with a report earlier that year that candidates are raising more money this year. It's not the amount of money, but it's the source of money from potential corrupting influences and that the hard money, in fact, has benefits to the party and to the candidates. The statistics showed that in, $500 million was raised in the year 2000 for soft, so-called soft money. Again, that's a euphemism for money that's going around the system. That, that was 42 percent of the amount of money that the national party spent on election activities, up from 9 percent in 1984, 42 percent. Of that $500 million, 60 percent came from just 800 donors. In that year, the top 50 donors each gave between 950,000 and $6 million a piece.",
  "I don't have a breakdown of that, Justice Breyer, but what the evidence does show, if you go back election by election, every two years, that incumbents under the old system, if a member of the House of Representatives decided to stand for re-election, the statistics year after year are the same, 97 to 98 to 98.5 percent of the incumbents were winning re-election. So to the extent that Congress would devise this scheme --",
  "No, no, Justice Scalia. But it directly addresses the question that you raised to the extent that Congress was looking for a scheme to protect incumbencies, they were doing very well. It would be hard to develop a scheme that could be better for incumbents.",
  "The -- that's, well, Justice Stevens, that's a reason for deferring to them. The evidence, as Mr. Starr put, was lavish, that the abuses were enormous, and that Members of Congress were spending --",
  "It is -- the evidence --",
  "Of course, of course --",
  "What this Court said in Buckley, in Shrink Missouri Government, in every one of the cases that this Court has considered is that those are indeed abuses that those are corrupting influences, and the word abuse was Justice Starr's practically, Justice Starr's first word, I mean General Starr's first word out of his mouth. That is everybody's word when it comes to the system. I guess you'll have to wait.",
  "It was everybody's word when they described this system, when you talk about the enormous amount of money that was avoiding the direct regulatory scheme and going through various surrogates to accomplish the same thing.",
  "Acting in his capacity, in the words of the statute, on behalf of the national committee. Acting as an individual that wouldn't be the case, but when he is speaking in terms of the party, that was the case. The, what Congress was attempting to do is --",
  "What an individual --",
  "That's -- I'm speaking now, Justice Scalia, in the terms of the statute itself. It talks in terms of his capacity as a member of the chairman of the party.",
  "And an individual might do something separately, and that's --",
  "Well --",
  "I suppose that would be up to some level of reasonable prosecution, prosecutorial discretion.",
  "Well, it's actually relatively clear, Mr. Chief Justice, the regular -- not only are the, is the statute relatively clear and not only does the statute specifically address the abuses that were well-documented and their evasions.",
  "Well, that, that, probably that language wouldn't even had to have been in the statute, Mr. Chief Justice. I would presume that would be presupposed that agents of the national party acting on behalf of the national party can't do the things that the national party can do. Organizations subject to the control of the national party can't do the same things that the national party can do. That indeed is the same sort of legislation that this Court has considered before. -- Let me -- on this subject",
  "There, there are indeed some of those areas where there are refinements because Congress was concerned with the -- this Court has said repeatedly that political parties are, have special advantages. Colorado II talks about that, that there are special rights and special privileges, and so Congress was concerned with the immense possibility, the immense power of national political parties to engage in abuses. So Congress was particularly concerned and with abundant record of the use of money going to the national parties to circumvent these things.",
  "It's entirely possible that Congress has not solved every potential abuse of Federal election law and that the lawyers will be back before this Court with another piece of legislation. Congress did not have before it evidence of abuse of that nature, Justice Scalia.",
  "It made some, in my judgment, perfectly understandable exceptions for individuals acting in their own capacity or individuals engaging in certain things, as opposed to the massive power of the party.",
  "Well, the challenge was the Equal Protection Clause was considered in Buckley. I see no evidence of any invidious discrimination. I guess we would be concerned.",
  "I think that that would be a very serious concern, Justice Kennedy, but there is not any evidence of invidious discrimination, to use the language of this Court in Buckley.",
  "Well, the Court has addressed that very concern starting with Buckley up through Colorado I and II. The fact that the party may be used as a conduit for circumvention of the limits on contributions to candidates. And let me add that the Republican National Committee, in their brief below, said that the Republican Party is a single unitary organization. This is at page 23 of the RNC opposition brief in the court below. The Republican Party is a single unitary organization that comprises various interrelated parts. The RNC, state and local parties, the RNC's 165 members, candidates identifying themselves as Republicans and so forth. And Mr. Burchfield, when he testified on April 5, 2000 before the Committee on Rules and Administration of the United States Senate, said, legislative proposals to ban party receipt of soft money also cannot seek to impose restrictions on state parties -- also must seek to impose restrictions on state parties as well. They cannot be effective otherwise. That's exactly what the understanding that Congress had when it addressed this statute.",
  "The distinction was made by this Court in Buckley and in the subsequent decisions that there is a higher level of scrutiny and a greater level of concern with respect to the amount being given to an individual and a greater identity and potential for abuse, because that money can then be spent either directly by the individual or in coordination with the political party on the individual's reelection, if individuals go out and affiliate with this group or that group and spend the money. That's not subject to the same kind of level of control by the party or the candidates and it is looked at --",
  "Congress didn't pick on a party, Justice Scalia. Congress focused on the fact that the parties control, as in the words of the segment from the brief that I quoted, the party and the candidates are, in one extent, one and the same. Secondly, the parties are given considerable privileges, the power to put candidates on the ballot. There is reasons that the exercise of this enormous power can be subject to greater restrictions. Congress wasn't picking on parties. Congress was, one, looking at where the greatest abuses were. And then number two, following the guidelines set by this Court.",
  "With respect to independent expenditures, the Court said that. And then the Court addressed the coordinated expenditures and approached it in quite a different way, and held that coordinated expenditures in Colorado II could be treated just like contributions. And the difference is that the Court has held, quite understandably, that the level of concern that Congress might have over abuses from contributions is greater, and the level of First Amendment concern is more attenuated because that contribution may be used in a different way, depending upon the contributions.",
  "In the first place --",
  "Well, it is the same proposition that is discussed in Buckley in connection with the aggregate contribution limit, and is discussed several times in the cases that come along since Buckley. The party is a different entity. The NRA or any other of the many organizations that might spend their money for this in a way that the candidate cannot control would not be focused in the same way. This Court provides the guidance that says that the parties, because they're so closely identified with the individuals, and such a source of potential circumvention, are something that the Congress may legitimately be concerned with. And this legislation was developed as a result of six years of intense investigation, debate, testimony, delicate compromises, all conducted in the context of congressional elections and a presidential election. This was a product of a lot of time by the people who, over and over again, talked about the level that abuses had come to.",
  "Well, we pass laws in the United States, Justice Scalia, by people who already hold office.",
  "What this Court has repeatedly said is that congressional judgments -- and I can only quote the language of this Court in Buckley. Congress could legitimately conclude, speaking in terms of potential for corruption. In the NRWC case in 1982, a unanimous Court said that careful legislative adjustment of Federal electoral law in a cautious, advanced, step-by-step, warrants considerable deference. We accept -- this is a unanimous Court -- Congress's judgment that it is the potential for such influence that demands regulation, nor will we second guess a legislative determination as to the need for prophylactic measures where corruption is the evil feared. If the Court were to look at the long series of the summary of abuses in Judge Kollar-Kotelly's decision below, and to look at the testimony given by former Senators Rudman and Simon and Boren and the other individuals who describe what it's like, the breakfasts, the lunches, the receptions, the dinners, the endless cycle of campaign finance.",
  "Justice Scalia, the parties and the candidates can spend all of the hard money they want on attack ads or any other types of ads. Congress was focusing there, with respect to specific types of legislation, in connection with the use of state money, soft money that comes to the state parties, in conjunction with elections taking place at which Federal officials are on the ballot.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I didn't mean to say that these numbers were saying it was too much work. What they were saying is that the relentless pursuit of big contributions was -- innervating to the political process. The record",
  "The potential for indebtedness, the feeling of indebtedness, the selling of access.",
  "Of course it is a --",
  "Of course it is a valid interest, Justice Stevens, but what all of these individuals were talking about was the appearance and the actuality that the system had been corrupted. The access --",
  "Well, there is two answers to that. The contribution limits have been increased.",
  "But what this Court has said in Buckley, and has also said over and over again is to the extent that the candidates and the parties have to reach out to more individuals for more participation rather than relying on this 800 or so individuals that give large amounts of money. That's better for the candidates and it's better for the parties and it's better for the political process.",
  "What -- what I'm, what I'm saying, Justice Scalia, is what this Court has said, that to the extent that a larger numbers of smaller contributors, that you don't need to spend all this much time courting is a better process for the political system. That's what this Court said, and that's what this Court has said over and over again.",
  "The, the legislation refers to money that is spent in Federal election activity. This Court has repeatedly said starting in the 19th century that the control, the regulation of Federal elections is quintessentially important to what Congress does. What Congress had abundant evidence that this money, that, that the individuals, my opponents are talking about having to do with state elections were when Federal candidates were on the ballot and money was being used ostensibly for neutral purposes, but for the primary purpose of bringing out voters to vote in a Federal election and to influence the outcome of that election.",
  "What --",
  "And the state party can spend unlimited amounts of money that's, that's in connection with an election. Congress reasonably found that where there is a Federal official on the ballot, that money spent in that election --",
  "Well, to the extent that under some circumstances, there is -- it's inconceivable to establish --",
  "Pardon me?",
  "No. I'm suggesting that where this money has been spent in the past and as defined by Congress in Section 323(b), Federal election activity is relatively clearly defined. It's in connection with -- Justice --",
  "That's correct. And this Court has said again and again to the extent that there's an overbreadth challenged in the context of a facial attack on a statute, the statute must be substantially overbroad. There may be particular as-applied challenges to particular aspects of this legislation.",
  "But Justice Scalia, what the -- what Congress was looking at is that the huge amounts of money being used at the time of elections where Federal candidates were on the ballot, political parties, and whether they be state parties or national parties are going, are not going to pour enormous amounts of resources into elections at which there is not much of a context, a contest. State parties can spend all of the Federal, the hard money they want with respect to those activities and then the Levin amendment, which was not required by the Constitution, not necessary, but that gave an additional ability of the state to use under certain circumstances soft money, unregulated by the Federal Government in those contexts. The bottom, at the bottom, what this legislation does is treat the very same abuses that this Court was concerned about in Buckley v. Valeo, and has said repeatedly are the types of concerns that are legitimate for Congress to be concerned about and to use the words of this Court, go to the very fundamental integrity of our government. The only thing in Title I that Congress did was to control the source of contributions, unions and corporate treasuries, and the amounts above a certain amount, and a potential circumventions of those limits. All three of those things this Court has repeatedly said are constitutional, appropriate, and necessary to protect the integrity of the Federal electorate process. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It is not a Sherman Act violation to breach a telephone interconnection agreement. The telephone -- the Telecommunications Act created an extraordinary, carefully crafted, comprehensive regulatory and remedial regime to force lawful monopolies --",
  "We did not brief and we did not take a position in our briefing on the standing question. We -- and our reason for doing that, Justice Stevens, is that we believe that in order to ascertain antitrust standing, one has to connect the injury, the alleged injury, to an antitrust violation. We feel that the question of whether or not there's an antitrust violation in this case comes before the determination of the antitrust injury. And therefore, the United States did not brief that question. We do believe that the '96 statute is, as this Court characterized it in its previous review of that statute, extraordinary in that it -- it set out to create competition in an area where the antitrust laws would not have accomplished that objective. The --",
  "We -- we felt, Justice Scalia, not in the context of Article III standing, but in the context of prudential standing in the context of antitrust standing which relates specifically to something this Court has called antitrust injury, which ties into the particular violation, and in order to determine that here, we felt that the Court would have to first answer the question whether there is an antitrust injury itself. Is there any violation of the antitrust laws that would give rise to a section 2, Sherman Act claim in this case.",
  "Well, we do think -- we do think -- and had we briefed the question, we would have -- we would have thought that there was -- that -- that Trinko had some points here, that it -- this is not an Illinois Brick case -- that Trinko was depending in part upon service provided by the Verizon loop and that it had a choice, as the plaintiffs -- the plaintiff -- that Trinko has alleged in this case, that it had a choice between deficient service from AT&T or -- or paying perhaps a higher price or something else from Verizon, that there are distinctions. And we think that they might -- but because we didn't brief that, because we thought it was -- the Court first -- we have a litigant here that alleges, and we have a Second Circuit decision, and we've got other circuit decisions that have addressed this very antitrust issue -- that it's very important to resolve that case, particularly in the context of where we have an -- a significant, extraordinary effort by Congress to create a comprehensive, complex, carefully modulated effort to create something.",
  "That we take -- I'm sorry.",
  "Under -- well, yes. In fact, this is in answer I think to Justice Ginsburg's question.",
  "There is a -- there would be -- and the Second Circuit did decide that there was a right to action under the discrimination provisions of section 202. And this appears -- it's the -- the first full --",
  "Well, first of all, to the extent that there is and to the extent that there are allegations of that, the court addressed that and reinstated that very cause of action. This Court decided not to review that. That --",
  "We do not dispute, Justice Souter, the existence of the cause of action recognized by the Second Circuit on page 16a --",
  "We do not.",
  "With respect to that section of the Communications Act.",
  "That's --",
  "That's also true and there's also an action against the -- the -- Trinko had a contract with AT&T to supply it with adequate telephone service. It may have a cause of action against AT&T. To the extent that AT&T attributes its inability to provide that service to Verizon, AT&T has already addressed that under the exclusive remedies it had available to it under the contract.",
  "Actually we submit, Justice Kennedy, that what the Communications Act does is something that the antitrust laws never did do. And the reason that the Communications Act was in -- in fact necessary to break up the monopolies, to cause legitimate, lawful monopolies to do something that the antitrust laws wouldn't require, that is, to open up their markets, which they had no obligation under the antitrust laws to do, at a subsidized rate to invite in competition -- that entire regulatory scheme was something that Congress decided was necessary to do which no other laws in existence had been able to do. Therefore, not only -- and I think that this is clear from the Court's jurisprudence as well, but also well articulated in the Town of Concord decision that was authored by Justice Breyer on the First Circuit. That regulatory regime, which monitors the conduct on an ongoing basis, which the antitrust laws are not well equipped to do, prevents the occurrence of antitrust injury and inhibits the ability to accomplish antitrust benefits and monitors the process in a way that succeeds in dealing with the possibility of anti-competitive conduct, but conduct that was not required at all under the antitrust laws, that on opening of the markets to selling one's assets at a discount, to going into a business that the lawful monopolist was not already in. The additional point there is that the treble damage remedy is considerably more draconian. It acts in an ad hoc, specific case under the supervision of generalize -- generalist judges and ad hoc juries. Whereas Congress decided that the scheme was most -- that was most appropriate -- the regime that was most appropriate to create this new world that this Court specifically recognized in the two previous Telecommunications Act cases was this regulatory regime, inhabited by experts, administered by experts, where there are prompt, efficient, effective remedies, and -- and a scheme which is adjustable from time to time to deal with any anti-competitive conduct. So it's not only a reason why Congress said we do not change the antitrust laws by this statute. There's good reasons why Congress decided to do that. But there's also additional reasons why the section 2 remedy would be a sledge hammer in an area where Congress has enacted a scalpel to deal --",
  "I agree with that, Justice Scalia --",
  "-- that the Court does not need to go into broader general principles. And this Court -- we -- we addressed those principles because we felt we had an obligation. And we have addressed -- the Government has articulated those same principles not only in this Court --",
  "It does -- no, we are not suggesting -- we're not saying that the -- that the act provides any immunity. The act still exists side by side. What we do say is that this was not -- this conduct was not a Sherman Act violation before the act, and the act specifically says --",
  "That's correct, but it's specifically true in the context of this regime that exists. To the extent that there is any anti-competitive activity, this Court has repeatedly said that it must look from -- at the antitrust laws and the application of the antitrust laws in connection with the particular industry and in a particular regime in which it exists. So when this Court -- this case comes to this Court, it is entirely consistent for this Court to look at the alleged violation of the antitrust laws in that context. The method that Congress selected to create -- to --",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Over 10,000 persons in 38 States invested $300 million in respondent's payphone business on the expectation that their investments would yield a 14 percent return due to respondent's experience, efficiency, and management expertise. The decision below that these transactions were not investment contracts merely because they specified a fixed return to the investor, rather than an unspecified portion of the enterprise's profits, can not be squared with the language, history, and purpose of the Securities Acts, 70 years of consistent SEC interpretation and enforcement, and this Court's jurisprudence. The congressional definition of security, as this Court has repeatedly said, is broad and flexible, and intended to be all-inclusive to cover the countless and variable schemes devised by those who would seek money from others on the promise of a return. Congress intended, in the words of this Court, to encompass virtually any instrument that might be sold as an investment, and the term investment contract, this Court has held, was intended to be a broad catch-all. Therefore, substance, not form or title, governs. These terms, investment contract, are to be construed broadly to embrace - again, in the words of this Court - all forms of investment schemes that bear a resemblance to what is commonly understood to be a security. And this Court has said, because promoters are so creative, these terms must be flexible and inclusive. A catch-all must catch all. It is irrational to conclude that Congress would have defined security -",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, I can answer this by saying that the seminal case, Howey, referred to and cited Blue Sky cases and Federal court of appeals decisions, which did contain those type of instruments, fixed return instruments. This specific question has not previously been decided by this Court, but the Court has never decided, and the cases that the Court referred to in Howey did not ever say that - that the fixed return instrument was excluded from the term investment contract.",
  "Well, again, with respect to that case, the - I - the Court has decided consistently that what is critical is the - that the investor expects a return. The Court has never said -",
  "Well, the - the references to the - to the - this - from this - our perspective, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the return must be examined from the standpoint of the investor, the invest - and the Court - I don't think the Court intended to restrict in that case, and the language is not reasonably susceptible in my judgement to the - to the understanding that that was intended to exclude investments or instruments that provided a fixed return. What the Court has repeatedly referred to is the - from the standpoint of the investor, what the investor is expecting to do is to put his or her money to work for him or her, that is to say, put that money into an enterprise of some sort so the investor can sit back and watch the returns come in. The investor doesn't care whether that's a fixed return or a speculative return. In fact, the definition in both the 33 and the 34 Act includes types of investments, such as common stock, that have speculative returns built into their definition, so to speak, fixed returns instruments, such as bonds, preferred stock, indentures, and that sort of thing. Then the term, as this Court has repeatedly said, those terms are relatively fixed and understood. But because Congress wanted to embrace, because this is a remedial statute intended to protect the investing public and the integrity of the marketplace so that people will feel secure in investing their resources in other instruments that promoters are offering -",
  "Well, I think the answer, Justice Ginsburg, is that many of those instruments that are ordinary debt instruments may be investment contracts as well. This Court has repeatedly said is that these terms are overlapping -",
  "Well, what this Court has said is that when a person puts their money into a common enterprise with the expectation - expectation of a return, that is - through the - as a result of the efforts of others, that is an investment contract. Now, many notes, or many types of offerings, might be based upon a fixed return and might appear in the - to look like notes or fixed return types of investments and still be investment contracts.",
  "It does - it does come from Howey, and I think that the best way to look at that, Justice Kennedy, is to look at that the investor, as opposed to using his own resources, his own efforts, his own energy, his own creativity, is counting on other people to make the - the instrument -",
  "Well - well -",
  "Well, that's right. That's correct. And there are some overlap, but this Court has said, and it repeated it and analyzed it from that context in the Reves case, that there are some commercial contexts and some consumer contexts in which the Securities Acts were never intended to cover.",
  "Well -",
  "We -",
  "What the Reves case says, and I think Your Honor is referring to footnote 4 in the case, in which the Court, in construing what was meant by the - the term note, looked at the definition of - in - in the Forman case, which included the earlier Howey case, as to define an investment contract. But in that footnote, the Court very carefully went on to say the definition that we're examining here with respect to investment contract is irrelevant with respect to notes. That is dicta piled upon dicta in a sense, because the Court - we - I - we respectfully submit - mischaracterized Forman, the case that the - where the Court was concentrating on the difference between someone investing their resources to get something to use, in that case -",
  "Well, what we - Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that what we're quoting with respect to what we're relying on is dicta. What the - the Court is - has defined the term investment contract, first of all, in the Joiner case, and then in the Howey case in very broad terms.",
  "That's - that is - that is probably not an investment contract because it is a personal transaction between individuals. What this - could the factors that this Court used in the Reves -",
  "Well, what the - one of the - one of the things that the Court said in Reves is that, to the extent that there are any ambiguities at the edge and those particular factors were considered in Reves, it - the - the scheme of distribution, the nature of the relationships between the individuals, is this - the - is someone seeking to acquire money to use as capital in the - in the operation of an enterprise -",
  "No, we're not saying that. In fact, the Court held to the contrary in the Wharf Holdings case that there may be - and in another case in this Court's jurisprudence - that simply because there are one individual or one entity dealing with another entity doesn't exclude the - the operation of the term investment contract.",
  "Well, with respect to the cases at the margin, the Court articulated the same kind of analysis that the Securities and Exchange Commission does. Where there are cases at the margin, the Court will consider the motivation of the person raising the money, the person investing in the - in the operation, the nature and type of promotion that's taking place, and - and the motivations of the seller and things of that nature. What - what the question presented here is considerably more narrow, the question presented here is it - is - is it disqualified as an investment contract simply because the return is fixed or specified? Now, if the Court were to adopt that definition, imagine the size of the super highway loophole that would be created in the Securities Act. Instead of promising the sky or - or a speculative return, the investors that develop these types of schemes will simply say 50 percent or 25 percent -",
  "Well, it's not - the - the only reason that the Eleventh Circuit decided that this case couldn't go forward - they couched it in terms of jurisdiction, but it's really failure to state a claim - was that this instrument had a fixed 14 percent return and said investment contracts can't not include that -",
  "Precisely.",
  "Well, I would adopt, and the Government would propose, that the Court do no more than rearticulate what the Court has repeatedly stated - and it's stated it as well in Howey as it could possibly state it - a transaction in which a person invests money in an enterprise with the expectation of a return, gain, profit. Now, in the Forman case that we submit was not characterized correctly in the Reves footnote, the Court used all of those terms, the expectation of a profit, the expectation of a return. In Howey itself the Court -",
  "The - what the Court has said is that in - in those kind of cases, where it does not look as typical as the typical investment scheme -",
  "What makes it look like a -",
  "Well, the characteristics are -",
  "Well, the things that make it look like an investment contract in this context is that the individual is putting himself, his money, into an enterprise that is being, in this case, widely promoted - as I said, 10 - over 10,000 investors put their money into this enterprise hoping to get some return as a result of the - the efficiency or effectiveness -",
  "Well, the - the precise lines here, Justice O'Connor, may be difficult in a particular one- on-one investment case. The Court acknowledged that in the Reves case, said that there - there are - there are situations that look more like consumer transactions or they may look - more look like -",
  "That's - that's correct, Justice -",
  "That was not what - yes, that's correct. Judge Lay discussed that in his concurring opinion, but the court did not rely upon that, the parties have not briefed that, and that question is not before this Court.",
  "I guess that's - I guess that's - that's possible. I -",
  "Yes, we did.",
  "Yes, we do. And - and - I think that there is - this is not a difficult case from that standpoint, because all of the indicia that the SEC has been using for years, and what the SEC has articulated this standard in formal adjudications, to which this Court defers under Chevron, it did 2 years ago in the Zandford case, with respect to the SEC, there is here in this case 70 years of consistent enforcement of this principle by the Securities and Exchange Commission -",
  "Precisely, and the Court has not done that in the past, does not need to do so here. There are situations like the Reves case where the Court said, well, some notes are securities, some notes are not securities, and then goes through - what the Court in that case was looking at, a Second Circuit decision that said, well, some notes are not securities, some are securities, and then laid out a methodology, which, by the way, is the same methodology that the SEC understand - well - widely understood to employ with respect to those cases at the margin. But, Justice Breyer, I agree completely. This is a paradigmatic investment contract. It's like the cases involving chinchillas or rabbits, one of these cases involving rabbits, it - there's two of the - two of the -",
  "That's not correct, respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice. Two of the - two of the cases cited in Howey, People v. White and Stevens v. Liberty Packing, were -",
  "No. I'm talking about cases that this Court accepted when it decided the Howey case, but this Court has never -",
  "Well, it certainly wasn't ruling it out, Justice Scalia. What this Court - what the - this Court specifically said in Howey, because it had nothing to go on. Congress, first of all, decided to make the definition as wide as possible to use again this Court's language to cover everything that might commonly be understood to be a security, and because promoters are so ingenious, to cover all types of investments that might carry some of those characteristics. So the Court said, we're going to look at the cases that involve the Blue Sky statutes that - that had been in existence and had been interpreted prior to the adoption of the 33 Act. There's not one of those statutes that limited investment contract to a variable return and excluded fixed return, was not one of those cases under the Blue Sky statutes that excluded fixed return investment contracts from the definition of investment contract.",
  "They were not - they were not - some of them were variable returns, Mr. Chief Justice, but some of them were fixed return. The two cases I cited, the one was People v. White, where, if the Court looks at that case, the Court will find that the - the - the language of it is - the party of the first part will pay $5,000 and the party of the second part after 5 years will pay $7,500 back. That was a fixed return investment. But not only did the Court in Howey cite those two Blue Sky cases that involved fixed returns, but the Court cited then four - and we mention these, I'll not go through the names again here, we mention them in our briefs - four court of appeals decisions that had involved no pooling of interest and there - there have been two SEC formal adjudications, which again, as I said, this Court gives deference to. And the first time the SEC sought to enforce an investment contract in this kind of context is SEC v. Universal Services, which goes back to 1936. Very seldom does this Court have that kind of 70-year history of consistent enforcement by the agency vested with responsibility, and again, these have matured themselves into not only court decisions but, in addition, formal adjudications. The securities laws have prophylactic purposes. They are designed to protect people that put their money in the hands of other people who are running business - businesses - and from whom they expect to make a return. I invite the Court's attention to exhibit 17 and particularly pages 116 through 119 of the joint appendix, and this is the type of note that the - the respondent will say, well, this was not our document, this was one of our distributor's documents, but it's alleged in the - in the complaint and there is evidence to support that this is - this was out there available for investors to see. There are millions to be made from pay - owning payphones, watch the profits add up. And then on page 119, this document goes on to say, for the payphone owner, the need to do individual things to make money is taken care of through these management contracts, because the payphone owner can benefit from the experience, operating efficiencies, and management expertise provided by ETS Payphones.",
  "Well, there's - there are many of things, at least, A, there was a promise that it was done, and secondly, Mr. Chief Justice, where that payphone is put, how it is managed, the appearance of the payphone, is it - is it mechanically functioning properly. This was the promise that was held out - give your money to us, we have thousands and thousands of these payphones -",
  "Well, that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and maybe that's the point, that - that the thousands of investors who invested in this type of scheme are the same type of thousands of investors that invest in other types of schemes. What the Securities Exchange Acts require is that for people who are marketing opportunities to invest widely to the public - and I use the word widely carefully because it doesn't have to be that widely, but it was here - to expect people to provide their money and then to provide a return to put their money to work, that's what the securities laws are all about, to provide that remedial prophylactic purpose of requiring registration so honest transactions will take place in the marketplace. If the investor could do to - to - to comply with the Eleventh Circuit and say, well, I'm not going to say 14 percent anymore, I'm going to say you're going to double your money every 5 years, or it's going to be a good return, it's going to - it's going to be pie in the sky, you're going to go home and retire, that would all of a sudden make it not an investment contract. And the very people -",
  "If it's - if -",
  "Mr. - Justice Scalia, if it's the same kind of transaction where I - I'm going to buy this payphone, lease it back to me, I'm going to have a management contract, and you're going to make a lot of money, the fact that it's one person, this Court's jurisprudence says does not make it not that - does not make it not an investment contract.",
  "Because it is a - it is -",
  "It is a - it is a package in which it - in the - in the first place is, I think, Justice Breyer's question suggests it might - that might be a note and that might be a security under certain circumstances. But is it a - it is the type of scheme transaction in which people invest their money on - for those types of purposes, and - and in - where - where there are difficulties at the margin, this Court and the SEC have provided a formula by which these various different factors can be examined as in the Reves case. What I was about to say is that to the extent that you change the requirement and allow it to be speculative, the more speculative you can be, the less likely you're required to comply with the securities laws. That seems like tilting the securities laws completely on their head. The people that are the least - that are the most risk-averse are looking for guarantees of returns and fixed returns. The people that depend - that aren't the Warren Buffetts, that depend upon the integrity of the system, are the ones that are going to be most vulnerable if the Eleventh Circuit decision is upheld. Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I will try to make just three points. One, this is about securities. The statute, which is extraordinarily broad, says note, stock, treasury stock, fractional undivided interest in oil, gas, mineral rights, straddle, option. It's - there - it would be difficult to draft the statute that was intended to be more all-inclusive than the words used in these two provisions of the 33 and 34 Act. It is manifestly clear that Congress wanted to cover the waterfront, as this Court has said, everything that looks like a security, and wanted to cover the whole range from pure equity, if there is such a thing, to pure debt, if there is such a thing. It would be - and then they put catch-all provisions. If the - if the words didn't cover it, there were catch-all provisions, investment contract is one. It would be irrational for Congress to say, well, we've got a catch-all for those - from A to Z - that go from A to H that look more - look like equities, but not S to Z that look more like debt, and then we're don't - not sure about the ones in the middle. The purpose for the catch-all provision is to catch all. That is what this investment contract was. Secondly, just two of the cases that were attempted to be distinguished by my colleague, People v. White, he said that did not involve a fixed return. Well, the language of the case - this is in 12 P.2d at 1081 - the individual promised to spay - pay - a specified sum on a specified date as principal and earnings for the stated period of time upon the investment. That's pretty much identical to what we have involved in this case. And in the Securities and Exchange Commission v. Universal Services, another one that my colleague referred to, page 234 of 106 F.2d, at the end of 5 years there would be returned to each member an amount equal to total contributions plus 30 percent per annum. Now, this case is 14 percent. The argument's that being made by the respondent here is an argument that the Blue Sky - a distinction that the Blue Sky Laws don't make. Congress did not make this distinction. The Court has never made this distinction. It conflicts with 70 years of consistent SEC enforcement. It is squarely inconsistent with the notion of a broad, flexible, remedial purpose of the securities statutes. It would make no sense, would create a gigantic loophole where individuals, by changing the terms of - from pie in the sky to 14 percent, and they would do that immediately, and Congress would have to deal with it in a way the Congress has already dealt with, and there is no reason to change what they - what the law has been, and the Eleventh Circuit decision should be reversed.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Promise Scholarship program practices the plainest form of religious discrimination. It disqualifies the one course of study that is taught from a religious perspective. The clear and unmistakable message is that religion and preparation for a career in the ministry is disfavored and discouraged.",
  "Well, yes, it is. But there is the other tradition that is as old as the country itself, is the free exercise component of the religion clauses, which this Court has said repeatedly mandates neutrality.",
  "Well, it's --",
  "Justice -- well, Justice Stevens, the individual that was disqualified in Tennessee from being a member of a delegate to the Constitutional Convention because he was a minister --",
  "Well, the same -- the Court would have come out the same way, I submit, if it said that ministers will not have their expenses paid, but everybody else will. The language of the decision and the language of Sherbert v. Verner and Fowler v. Rhode Island is that to the extent that a religion --",
  "Well, he can practice it, but he practices it at a price. Studying of theology as the --",
  "He practices it without the same subsidy that is made available to every other citizen except someone who wants to study to be a minister. If it was discrimination against a minister in -- in the -- in the case involving Tennessee, this is a discrimination against a person who aspires to be a minister. He is given less of an advantage than all --",
  "We submit that the teachings of the decision of this Court --",
  "What this Court has said, Justice Stevens, is that in -- in many respects the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause are components of the same principle that is --",
  "Well, there is -- there may be breathing space, especially with respect to the Establishment Clause area, where this Court will not find entanglement or endorsement under certain programs that may not be required, but what this Court has said is that distinguishing -- that discriminating against Catholics and discriminating against people who are religious generally and even people who are anti-religious generally violates the twin components of equality and neutrality that are -- that are mandated by the religion clauses.",
  "Yes, Justice Breyer. It is not a major step at all in this Court's jurisprudence to say that those funding programs for medicine, doctors, nurses, cannot distinguish and not discriminate against a person who decides to go to a Catholic nurse or to a Catholic doctor. If money is made available for individuals in the Medicare program to exclude people that want to go to religious hospitals for their heart surgery, that would violate the Free Exercise Clause.",
  "It would depend, I suppose, on how the program was structured, what the inquiry involving a compelling government -- strict scrutiny would entail. There may be a difference, for example, with respect to funding that's associated with institutions, as opposed to individual conscience. This is the plainest form of religious discrimination because the person who wants to believe in God or wants to have a position of religious leadership is the one that's singled out for discriminatory treatment. The Court has said before that distinction, religious tests for governmental benefits violate the Free Exercise Clause. This is a religious test. If the person wants to take a program in theology, he's disqualified.",
  "I would say that the -- it is not as far-reaching as the -- the sense of doom that your question suggested.",
  "The idea that this country when it -- when it provides tax exemptions or cash to citizens to educate their children, cannot single out for discriminatory treatment the Catholic or the religious person is not a far-reaching -- well, it may have been far-reaching at the time, and thank heavens that it is, that this principle as the -- I think one of the questions, I think it was Justice O'Connor's question, asked with respect to the funding cases and this Court dealt specifically with that in the Maher v. Roe case when it said the funding cases do not control the significantly different context in which a funding decision impinges upon the constitutionally-imposed government obligation of neutrality required by the religion clauses. So those funding cases are completely distinguishable --",
  "About --",
  "For the reason that the same argument was rejected in the Rosenberger case, that the notion of --",
  "I -- I respectfully submit that it is, that the students in the Rosenberger that were publishing those articles were publishing articles that advocated belief in God.",
  "That was --",
  "Yeah, but the Court went on to say that this was a free exercise violation as well as a First Amendment violation. The other point that I think is very, very important with respect to that, if the state starts to distinguishing between discussion of a subject and proselytizing, the entanglement problem is going to be enormous. The program will have to be looked at to see how persuasive it is. We know today that --",
  "Well, because --",
  "No, because the line has been drawn by individuals, individuals making genuinely free, independent choices to make a dispensation. It's like the Court's example in those cases of an individual receiving a check and then deciding exactly how to spend it so there's a great difference between those kind of cases. This is no different than the example that Justice Scalia raised as providing fire protection or -- or providing tax deductions. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The South Coast rules prohibit the purchase of certain motor vehicles and require the purchase of others based on explicit emission standards. Under respondents' reasoning, every other State and local government agency in the United States could adopt its own individual and unique blend of prohibited and permitted motor vehicles. But --",
  "I think the answer is -- is no, but let me explain, that to the extent that agencies of government, the State or subdivisions, are purchasing their own vehicles, we do not contend that that is unconstitutional. They can purchase --",
  "Our -- our position -- I don't -- I'm not sure I know the answer to that because I don't know what authority this agency has with respect to requiring different units of -- of the government of the State of California to purchase or not purchase vehicles. And it hasn't -- it's not a subject that was briefed, if at all, extensively in the briefs. But the -- the force -- the force of the preemption provision here is that Congress determined that there should be a uniform standard with respect to controls on the emissions of motor vehicles. California was given an exception provided that certain requirements were met. This is in section 209(b) that these provisions be submitted to the EPA and approved under a process that's open and transparent and allows the national agency to make sure that there are uniform standards that can be met that also comply with the requirement that the national economy not be disrupted, so that there would be different -- by different standards in every little community of the United States. That's the thrust --",
  "Not that I know of. They've -- they've only been in existence since the year 2000. The -- the district was given the authority to adopt these rules in 1987, if I'm correct, did not adopt them until the year 2000. The arguments -- the principal arguments that are made by respondents that standards are production mandates finds no basis in the statute. The language of section 202 or section 209 is not so limited. The -- what -- what section 202 and 209 do, talk about emission levels or emission standards. And there should be no mistake about it. These fleet rules are directly related to emission standards. One of them, for example, rule 1194, uses the phrase, emission standards, 12 times and it requires all purchasers to be vehicles that meet certain emission standards, adopting by reference the State of California CARB rules. It picked out a subset, as the respondents put it, of one in column A, two in column B, no diesel. There must be some clean fuel. It's another -- it's a totally different package. And Palm Beach County or -- or Waco -- the City of Waco could do something exactly like what the respondents are contending because they say the controls with respect to emissions don't apply if they're purchasing requirements. EPA, in fact, enforces the standards that it adopts under section 202 pursuant to the provisions of 203 by restricting the sale or introduction into commerce of motor vehicles and under section 219, under certain circumstances, the purchasers of fleets, bus fleets. So the implementation of the limitations that -- that -- the standards that EPA adopts are through purchase restrictions or purchasing restrictions. They're not production mandates. It's my understanding and I'm informed that the EPA has never implemented the Clean Air Act with respect to production mandates. They say what can be sold or what can be purchased.",
  "Well, it is not -- we -- we are not contending, Justice O'Connor -- I want to make it very clear that local agencies, San Francisco or Los Angeles, can put for their own vehicles anything they want. This district -- I -- the -- the --",
  "For its own purchases. If it -- I don't know whether it does or not. This is a quality control district. I don't know how many vehicles they have.",
  "We don't think that it has the authority to require other governmental agencies based upon emission standards to do something.",
  "That is a matter of State law, and it's -- and -- and what we're talking about here is the requirement by particular agencies to pick out different types of motor vehicles that may or may not be sold.",
  "For their own -- for their own purchases, Justice Kennedy.",
  "I agree with the -- with the way that the Chief Justice put it, that that's their own purchasing decisions, and it's a matter of State law as to whether they can -- but that is not what this case is about. This case is about whether the South Coast district can impose those standards, including Federal Government vehicles, postal vehicles, FBI vehicles, private vehicles that go to the airports and so forth. And the justification that they say is that we can control the sale of motor vehicles willy-nilly by -- by controlling the purchase. By controlling the purchase, you control what can be sold and thus can what be manufactured. They are claiming an authority in southern California that they -- that they claim the EPA doesn't even have.",
  "Justice --",
  "From the standpoint of the United States Government, we're not contending that the State or an individual can choose whatever vehicle he or she or it wants to purchase. What we're contending is that the whole scheme of the EPA and the Clean Air Act and the -- and the preemption provisions prevent different agencies by using the -- the mechanism. The entire argument that respondents advanced here, by using the word -- by -- by prescribing what can be purchased, they can -- they can control what vehicles will exist and what vehicles will be run. It isn't limited. The authority that they're claiming isn't limited to their own vehicles. This same authority -- they would make the same arguments if the South Coast District said all persons or all persons that have more than one vehicle or all persons that live in a certain portion of southern California. The authority that they claim by using the word purchase, which is not in the statute, is not in the preemption provision, and is an authority that the -- the EPA specifically uses to a certain extent under section 219 --",
  "Well, A, I think that is an inhibition. B, I think the respondents will say that these -- these purchasing requirements are imposed upon fleet owners that -- that requires them to make purchases of certain vehicles. So I think the premise of your question is not correct. If southern California or if the State of California wishes to impose fleet requirements, there is a mechanism. It's a logical, consistent, transparent, open mechanism under -- that was thoughtfully put out by Congress. The whole mechanism is thoughtfully calibrated by Congress to allow the EPA to make judgments. Does this make sense from a national standpoint? Will this make sense from other States' standpoints? Is it -- will it impose a dislocation on the marketplace for motor vehicles? The twin objectives of the Clean Air Act are, one, to produce cleaner air, but two, to do it in a way that does not disrupt the national economy and the marketing of motor vehicles, which is an important part of the economy of this Nation.",
  "To the extent that -- yes. I'm -- because I don't know the answer to the State law question that the Chief Justice alluded to. Assuming that the State of California was one and the same and decided that it owned or had the authority under State law to purchase those vehicles, the answer would be yes.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Child Online Protection Act addresses a problem that all three branches of our national Government have repeatedly and consistently described as compelling, the pervasive and essentially unavoidable commercial Internet pornography that inflicts substantial physical and psychological damage on our children. COPA was carefully drafted by Congress after hearings, debate, reports, and findings according to explicit guidance from this Court as to how constitutionally to address and resolve and deal with this -- this menace.

Justice Stevens, what the -- what the -- what the purveyors of this material do is put in front of the screen provocative material that we submit would meet the definition of harmful to children and make that available to everybody to entice people to go the next step to use their credit card or their age identification mechanism to go the next step.",

By statute, a criminal statute protects the privacy of your doing that, and the -- and the balance that Congress struck, which is what this Court dealt with when it dealt with this statute two -- on two previous occasions, the Court did acknowledge that there's a compelling governmental interest here, and that significant harm is being done on a daily basis. The magnitude -- we point this out on page 20 of our brief -- that 11 million children visit these porn sites every week, and that between the ages of 15 and 17, 70 percent of the children, according to the statistics that we cite, visited porn site inadvertently. It is very difficult to avoid. As we describe in our brief, the use of innocuous names, I'd mentioned last time that I was here and it hasn't changed, Whitehouse.com is a porn site.

Now, in many cases it won't be necessary to do that, but something that might appear to be harmful in one context, if it's examined as a whole and it turns out to be a part of an art exhibit or a anatomy book or a sex education program, that would -- would have redeeming value.

  "There's two answers to that, Justice Scalia. As this Court has repeatedly said, the Constitution does not require impossible definitions. What is -- what puts a person reasonably on notice is an appropriate way to go, and what -- the -- the reason why it was 16 rather than 17, of course, is because this Court criticized the previous statute because it drew the line at a different age. It would be impossible, I submit, for Congress to select a different age for every different piece of material. What Congress was trying to get at was the worst problem, the material that even with respect to 16-year-olds meets the standards set out in the statute. That at least -- very much. I -- I think Congress probably wanted a good deal of stuff that might be okay for 16-year-olds not to -­ not -- not to be shown -­",
  "No, as a matter of fact -­",
  "As a matter of fact, Congress was very clear that what it was adopting is what this Court had previously considered in the American Booksellers case and those blinder racks and the -- and the definition that came out of the American Booksellers case and the subsequent Fourth Circuit definition of that term in that case, of which this Court subsequently denied cert. Those bookseller blinder rack cases are exactly cited in the legislative history. This is a remarkable instance of where Congress went through all of the things that the Court identified as problems with the previous statute, grappled with each of these definitions, adopted Court-approved definitions, standards, and limitations with respect to what this Court has agreed is a compelling problem. If I can return to Justice Kennedy's concern about the issue of -- take -- the commercial pornographers, the statute is very clear that it refers to people that are in the business of profiting from this material, and then the being engaged in this and says that someone that takes time, effort, or labor in the regular course of a business of -­ of profiting from the transmission of this material. So the legislative history, the previous iteration of the problem in this Court makes it clear that what Congress was concerned about and was -- was not trying to capture with this statute the person that occasionally transmitted a -- a photograph or an image, but someone who is in the business of doing this on a regular basis for profit.",
  "Well, the answer to that, Justice Kennedy, is the -- the fact that this is not any -- that that definition, what the Congress adopted at the suggestion of this Court, was the same definition that this Court had approved in prior contexts with respect to obscenity, 18 obscenity, is something that prosecutors and courts have been dealt -- been dealing with for a couple of -- for over, well over a generation, for several decades. So -­",

  "That's -­",
  "Yes, I -- Congress would not have wanted to create that massive loophole, because the people that are -- this is a multi-billion dollar business, the people that are doing it would readily adapt to that type of a loophole. The other one that was suggested by the is that somehow Congress should have required that this would be the primary business that the person was engaged in. Again, that would have been a massive loophole subject to constant litigation over what was the primary business and whether a person's surrounded the harmful material with an acre or two of unharmful material. What Congress was getting at is that people that are in the business, knowing and knowing the character of the material, two other terms that are in the statute, that are making money distributing this material and who won't take the steps necessary to protect minors from them. With respect to the argument that the respondents make and the court of appeals focused on that blocking at the home might somehow be a problem, Congress carefully considered that, decided it would not be an acceptable solution, except that it did at the same time enact -- that it enacted COPA, required that the Internet service providers make that type of information available to people in their homes so that that could be in addition to what COPA requires. The fact is that blocking material in the home is both underinclusive and overinclusive. It requires the consumer to go out and buy a product and spend money to adapt it to technological improvements that are happening this again is outside the record, but I did this, anyone can do this, the same experiment over the weekend. I went to Google and I typed in disable filter and you push the button and you will get a screen full of programs that will tell you step by step how to dismantle the computer so your parents won't know about it. It is that easy, and you can put it back on. These things are readily avoidable. So the burden that Congress was -- was -- the burden that Congress imposed at the suggestion of this Court is to put the burden on the person or persons making money on a regular basis from this product to take the minimal steps necessary to prevent the damage that's done every day by minors by allowing people to use mechanisms that are already in place. This Court mentioned it and Congress mentioned it, this adult check mechanism, that's another thing that -- that anyone can check out. Type in adult -- adult ID, and then press the button and you will find, I think there were 25 sites that mention in the congressional history which will provide an adult identification at a relatively nominal cost, I think it was 19.95 for a several-month period or something like that, and the availability is such that the steps that can be followed take a matter of less than a couple of minutes. So in the privacy of the home, the adult who wants damage to children in the privacy of the home with statutory protection as to anonymity, the -- the problem can -- it -­ it cannot be totally solved, but this is an important major step and this is an example of Congress following the directions of this Court as to how constitutionally to do it. Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Yes. I don't -- I don't read it that way. I don't think that's the -- the exception is intended to -- to allow the person safe harbor by performing the function of the adult check. I mean, I think that's what it's intended for -­",
  "-- and it hasn't been, hasn't been identified before as a giant loophole in the statute, and I don't think it's susceptible to that construction. I wanted to go back to where Justice Breyer started, what would be covered by the statute? The examples given by the respondents were addressed in the Government's brief and all three of the -- all of those examples we don't believe are covered by the statute. Susie Bright is not within, doesn't fit within the prurient interest in the -­ and would be defended on -- this is reminiscent of what the Court was facing in the American Booksellers case, and the respondents here were involved in that one as an amicus, where 16 examples were cited as the house was going to fall down, the sky was going to fall. This Court decided to remand that to the -- the Virginia Supreme Court and the Virginia Supreme Court found that none of the 16 parade of horribles would be even covered by the statute. That's this all over again, and it reasonable, a construction of the statute that would be, to which it would be reasonably susceptible that would deal with those constitutional problems. And -- and these definitions, these definitions have already been approved with respect to minors in the Ginsberg v. New York case, so we're not -- and that's a couple of -- several decades ago, so we're not dealing with something that is brand new. Susie Bright, by the way, writes for Salon magazine. In order to get her column you have to register. Adult IDs, you can get them with credit cards, you can get them with a check, and as we point out in footnote 2 of our brief, you can use a driver's license or a passport, so you don't have to necessarily use a credit card to do that. The -- the deterrence issue, all of the -- all of the -- all the court of -- the lower courts decided is that some people may be deterred, may be deterred, and some people may be -- find this as an impediment. Some people may engage in self-center -- self-censorship, and to the extent that there are thousands of people, that's an infinitesimal quantity of what's on -- on the Web in itself. The most important point here, with respect to alternatives, Congress considered, as this Court suggested it should, the various alternatives. The House, the Senate report's good, but the House report, 775, which is cited all over the briefs on pages 16 through 20 considered all of these examples, the tagging, the filtering and so forth and went through all of the reasons why Congress found that they would not be effective and that what COPA was providing would be effective, that there were costs, the burden should be on the commercial purveyor of the material and so forth. Congress went through all of these things and made specific findings. At the end of the day, it's important to emphasize this is a facial challenge to a statute constructed according to this Court's guidance, according to this Court's decisions as to how to deal with a very serious national problem. It contains a scienter requirement the purveyor of this material must know what's being done, he must be engaged in the regular course of business, and I can't recall -- I think it was you, Justice Breyer -- who asked the question, how else could Congress have done it? This is a national problem. It's serious. It's causing irreparable injury to our most important resource, our children. Congress has been struggling with this. It listened to what this course had -- Court had to say. It examined the nature of the medium, because this is a different medium, but one of the wonderful things about this of this medium. It's easily accessible to children in the home and it's important that the Government be -- this Nation and its three branches of government be concerned with the care and welfare of children independent of the parents' responsibility. So this is an example of a serious national problem, Congress following conscientiously this Court's guidance as to how to solve the problem and then laying it out for this Court as to how it did so, and it came up with this statute, which is constitutional.",

In fact, when the respondent brought this case when he had joint custody without consulting with the mother, the trial court found here that it was unconscionable to bring this case, especially when he knew that it might adversely affect the interests of the child.

One decision-maker has to make decisions with respect to the best interests of the child and the collision of those interests, and that comes into play because the child is the one that -- it's interesting that the respondent's brief are full of references to the interests of the child, the alleged coercive effect of the Pledge of Allegiance, the impact on the child's rights and so forth, though -- therefore, although the respondent talks about this separate independent right of his interest when his -- when it comes to his brief, the issues that he's articulating throughout the brief don't support that standing.

Fourteen Justices of this Court since the Pledge of Allegiance was amended have indicated that the Pledge of Allegiance is not a religious exercise, it is something different of a ceremonial nature.",
  "Well, they -- there were references to the case in -- of -- of course in the briefs and -- and in connection with the case, but the fact is that the Court was distinguishing, and the Court repeatedly said that, that there is a major distinction between those purely religious exercises such as prayers or recitation of the Ten Commandments, or in the evolution cases. The respondent cites nine cases that he says support the proposition that he's articulating. He left out a number of other cases where the Court has considered the issue of religion in public schools, but those very cases, including the -- the Lee v. Weisman case involved a Pledge of Allegiance at the same time that the prayer was being uttered. Those -- all of those cases refer to the difference in significant constitutional respects.",

  "Yes and no, and I would like to answer, explain if I may.",
  "It's an important question because the reference to under God in the pledge, as numerous decisions of this Court have indicated in dicta, what as a part of a -- of a thought process of coming about to the conclusion that it -- it is an acknowledgment of the religious basis of the framers of the Constitution, who believed not only that the right to revolt, but that the right to vest power in the people to create a government became -- came as a result of religious principles. In that sense, the Pledge of Allegiance is today, that has that same significance to this country as it did in 1954 when it was amended. But as this Court has also said, and that's the other part of my answer to your question, this Court has also said the ceremonial rendition of the Pledge of Allegiance in context repeatedly over the years has caused -- would cause a reasonable observer familiar -- as this Court's First Amendment Establishment Clause jurisdiction points out -- would cause a reasonable observer to understand that that is -- this is not a religious invocation. It is not like a prayer, it is not a supplication, it's not an invocation. It is -­",
  "Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and that is for many reasons, for -- because of the reason that I just made, but also because the Congress revisited this issue in 2002 after the decision below in this case. There are findings in the record which are a part of the brief, with respect to what the -- what the pledge means, the context of the pledge in its historical context, in the connection with its civic invocation, its ability to invoke certain principles that are indisputably true, which gave rise to the institutions which have given us freedom over all this period of time. It's in -- it is significant that the Court in, the Congress, in making those findings, specifically referred to the decisions that I was referring to before, which have been characterized as dicta, but very important dicta, because they explain how the Court came to its conclusions. So those are differences. The other difference that should be made is that the challenge here too is not directly to the Pledge of Allegiance, but it's to the invocation or the -- the articulation of the Pledge of Allegiance in the Elk Grove School District. The State of California requires those patriotic exercises in that school district under the phrase, patriotic responsibilities of the schools, or words to that effect, and that -- and the school district itself puts this in the category of a patriotic exercise. And to go back to what this Court has taught us with respect to the Establishment Clause and the endorsement prong of the Establishment Clause, it's the entire context. It's the nation's history, it's a Pledge of Allegiance to the flag and to the nation for which it stands, and then a descriptive phrase, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. So -­",
  "Well, they don't. They don't have to say it. They don't -­",
  "They can take part in the pledge -­",
  "-- without saying any words. They can decide not to participate in the pledge at all, and I think that's covered by the West Virginia v. Barnette decision of this Court. The -- the -- and I want to make this point before my time elapses, is that the respondent makes a point of saying, this is the same as requiring the pledge to say one nation under Jesus. That is completely different. It's not supported by the history where the framers of our Constitution repeatedly referred to God, Lord, the creator, and there's a very interesting piece of history with respect to that. When the Virginia bill of establishing religious freedom was articulated, they -- they used the phrase, the holy author. Thomas Jefferson in his autobiography, which was published in 1811, said there was a motion to amend to refer to the holy author, Jesus Christ, and he said in his autobiography that that was rejected because the framers of the Virginia Bill of Rights, or act establishing religious freedom, which is a precursor to the Establishment Clause, was intended not to include any particular sect, but to -- to apply to Jews, Hindus, Mohammedens, and it even says the word infidels in Thomas Jefferson's explanation for the background of that act. In -- in summary, the state -- the Pledge of Allegiance is not what this Court has said the Establishment Clause protects against, that is to say, state-sponsored prayers, religious rituals or ceremonies, or the imposition or the requirement of teaching or not teaching a religious doctrine. The Establishment Clause does not prohibit civic and ceremonial acknowledgments of the indisputable historical fact of the religious heritage that caused the framers of our Constitution and the signers of the Declaration of Independence to say that they had the right to revolt and start a new country, because although the king was infallible, they believe that God gave them the right to declare their independence when the king has not been living up to the unalienable principles given to them by God.",

But what was unquestionable with respect to that case is that an alien who had never had any relationship to the United States and who was being held as a result of a combat situation or a war situation in a foreign jurisdiction, there was no jurisdiction under the Habeas Statute.",

And the Court went on to say, no such basis can be invoked here for these prisoners at no relevant time were within any territory over which the United States is sovereign, and the scenes of their offense, their capture, their trial and their punishment were all beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.

  "Well, I suspect that there are many decisions of this Court where, when the Court is dealing with the facts of a specific case, especially in the context of a Court of Appeals decision, if the Court were to turn to the briefs that were written before to present the issue in this Court, the only -- the question presented, submitted in this case, in this Court, in Eisentrager was the jurisdiction under the Habeas Statute. But the case arose in the context where the Court of --",
  "It was --",
  "But the Court was specifically focusing on the jurisdictional incidents attached to the condition of the individual --",
  "The Court specifically did say, but did not mention the statute, Justice O'Connor, but the statute is mentioned throughout the briefs, in the government's brief when it says what -- the statute at issue, the Habeas Corpus Statute and within its territory, the language of Part A. The statute that exists today is the same statute that the Eisentrager Court was considering.",
  "Well, it seems to me again the entire opinion has to be taken in context. The Court did specifically say that there is no statutory authority. It didn't say, it didn't identify by number a provision of the code, but it specifically said no statutory authority.",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, I submit that in the context of the case, in the context of the way the dissent understood it, as well as the majority understood it --",
  "Well, we would submit that Ahrens, the over -- partial overruling, I think, has been pointed out before. Ahrens has no effect on the vitality of the Eisentrager case. The Court made clear that it was deciding -- and everyone -- the reason I mentioned the briefs is the context in which the case was presented to the Court, and argued to the Court and the decision that was made by the majority in the Court, focusing on the identity of the Petitioner, whether alien or friendly. Justice Black in his dissenting opinion says this decision would apply to whether someone was hostile or not, and the entire context of the case, Justice Stevens, it seems to me, and does not --",
  "Well, it seems to me that a fair reading of the case goes much further than that, because the Court was not focusing on that. It didn't specify that it was making its decision on that basis. It did specify over and over again, and the dissent referred to this as well, that it was focusing on the fact that the individuals bringing the petition had no sufficient contacts with the United States. That's in part why the Court distinguished --",
  "It did not, as I'm --",
  "I don't recall that it did. The District Court --",
  "The District Court relied upon that decision. The Court of Appeals went much further with respect to -- in fact, the Court, and this Court, Justice Jackson's opinion for the Court in this case specifically points out that the Court of Appeals went back to something it called fundamentals, because it couldn't find any authority in either the statute or the Constitution.",
  "I believe that's a correct characterization. What -- the other portion of the decision that it seems to me important to recognize is that this is a decision that was widely perceived, and has been consistently perceived, as a definition of the scope of the Habeas Statute. Going back to the early 1800s, this Court decided that the extent of habeas jurisdiction arose from the statute, not from the common law.",
  "I think, Justice Kennedy, the answer to that is, in the first place, we are not, we are not saying that there necessarily would be jurisdiction there, but we are saying that the Court -- that the Court would go further with respect to that because, and this is also in Eisentrager and a number of other Court's -- of this Court's decisions, that the Court will find more protection for citizens as a result of the relationship going back --",
  "We are not -- we are saying that we would not be contesting it, Justice Kennedy, and the Court will be dealing with other issues involving citizens.",
  "Well, I guess the only way I can answer this, Justice Stevens, is to say that what the Court seemed to say, not only in the majority opinion, but in the dissenting opinion, that more rights would be given to citizens --",
  "I don't --",
  "I think that the answer is that that does not necessarily follow. The Court has not reached that decision yet, and that's something that is not before the Court.",
  "I agree with that, justice Scalia, and this Court has said again and again that",
  "And it was -- and in that case, the Court specifically said the Fifth Amendment did not extend to the Petitioners in that case. The Court has said that again in the Verdugo case in terms of the Fourth Amendment.",
  "I think it would be an interpretation. And what this Court is doing is interpreting the statute because the Habeas Corpus Statute defines the extent of rights --",
  "Our answer to that question, Justice Souter, is that citizens of the United States, because of their constitutional circumstances, may have greater rights with respect to the scope and reach of the Habeas Statute as the Court has or would interpret it. That case has never come before this Court, and it's important to emphasize that --",
  "Excuse me, Justice --",
  "And this Court construed those provisions in the Eisentrager case and determined that the statute did not reach aliens that did have no contact with the United States and were held in a foreign jurisdiction outside the sovereignty of the United States.",
  "Well, Justice Stevens, I respectfully disagree. I think the Court was construing the statute not to be applicable, then it went on because the Court of Appeals had addressed the constitutional question.",
  "Well, I respectfully disagree. The Court does say, we don't find any authority in the statute. We don't find any authority in the Constitution. We will not go to so-called fundamentals to find it someplace else. That is consistent with what this Court decided in the --",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, there are several answers to that. You started with the proposition that there was no check and that the executive is asserting no check. This is the interpretation of the scope of a Habeas Statute. Congress had -- has had 54 years with full awareness of the decision to change it. Indeed, as we point out in our brief, eight months after the Eisentrager decision, a bill was introduced that would have changed that statute, H.R. 2812, which would specifically have changed the statute to deal with the Eisentrager situation, so there is a check.",
  "Well, I understand that, but the bill was -- came eight months after Eisentrager.",
  "That's precisely correct. And they had a bill before them eight months after the Eisentrager decision which had -- that Congress proceeded on it. Congress has also dealt with the Habeas Statute in a variety of other ways. It has seen fit in no way to change the decision required by this Court with respect to the statute. You mentioned several hundred years of British history was your second point. All of those cases, or virtually all of those same cases that have been brought up in the briefs, and the amicus briefs today, were in the briefs that were before the Eisentrager --",
  "Well, let me get back to it again. Those earlier cases were decided and rejected in Eisen -- in the Eisentrager case. Whether there is a check on the executive, there is a Congressional check through the power of legislation, through the power of oversight, through the power of appropriations. There is --",
  "Congress could do all that",
  "Yes, it could --",
  "Well, we would agree with that and we would emphasize the point that stepping across that line would be impossible to go back from with respect to prisoners in the battlefield. In fact, the reply brief refers to the front lines in Iraq, in a battle station in Iraq. We are talking here about battlefield decisions and --",
  "Well, to the extent that the Court would say, the executive, you must give a military process because the Petitioners in this case, first of all, demanded in their petition and they would have a right to raise these issues to the extent they have not backed off in this case, but they demanded in their petition, their release, unmonitored communications with counsel, cessation of interrogations, evidentiary hearings.",
  "Well, there is no question that that is exactly right. And to the extent that what the Petitioners are seeking is to oversee the circumstances -- this is the language in their brief, to oversee the circumstances of detention. That is going to vary from case to case.",
  "But Justice Ginsburg, the relief that I was articulating is what they asked for in the first instance. If they have jurisdiction in this Court, the next Petitioner doesn't have to say well, I only want a process. And if they only want -- now they are saying they only want an executive branch process to review. As we explained --",
  "Yes, we would. Because we are talking about territorial sovereign jurisdiction of the United States. What -- what exists in Guantanamo is no different than existed in Lansberg Prison and --",
  "It is, it is the line that this Court drew and repeatedly articulated --",
  "Because it is a line that is, is -- has the virtue of what Justice Breyer was talking about, of having relative certainty. It is a line that's defined by State to State relationships.",
  "Well, the complete jurisdiction is a phrase in that lease, the lease specifically says that ultimate sovereignty is Cuba's. It specifically says that the United States",
  "With respect -- the lease restricts the ability of the United States to use that property for only Naval or coaling purposes. It specifically says it may not be used for any other purpose.",
  "What is cited in the brief, and we explain that the President is not an agency under the APA, that the United States military with respect to operations and military operations are specifically exempted by the APA.",
  "And that the fundamental nature of what the Petitioners are seeking here is the review of the nature and status of their detention, which sounds in -- and is examined by this Court repeatedly under the doctrine of habeas corpus. And that there is no foundation. In fact, I submit that the way the briefs have been written, the Petitioners don't even feel strongly about the APA position. What they are talking about, and why most of their briefs explain, they are focusing on fundamental habeas corpus as it existed throughout the centuries. What is important to emphasize here with respect to all of these questions, with respect to, well, how much control would there be, how much control would there be in Guantanamo versus a place in Afghanistan or another place --",
  "The Canal Zone was treated differently by Congress. Congress created, applied, under its responsibility with respect to territorial and insular or unincorporated territory, applied laws there, put a court there. So it's very different than the Canal Zone.",
  "Because it is -- because it is a -- in the first place, the question of sovereignty is a political decision. It would be remarkable for the judiciary to start deciding where the United States is sovereign and where the United States has control --",
  "We have that, Justice Ginsburg, in every place where we would put military detainees, in a field of combat where there are prisons in Afghanistan where we have complete control with respect to the circumstances.",
  "The Court actually heard a case, Neely vs. Henkel, in 1901, which specifically addressed that, and held that the United States did not have sovereignty for the enforcement of its laws in Guantanamo. And at that point --",
  "With respect to a certain area, a military base in Germany, a military base in Afghanistan, the United States must have and does exercise relatively complete control. Every argument that's being made here today could be made by the two million persons that were in custody at the end of World War II, and judges would have to decide the circumstances of their detention, whether there had been adequate military process, what control existed over the territory in which they were being kept. What this is --",
  "There is a great deal of differences in connection with every area over which the United States has some degree of control. The degree of control that it has here is limited to specific purposes in -- with respect to the sovereignty of Cuba.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is a case about the separation of powers. The Constitution explicitly commits to the President's discretion the authority to obtain the opinions of subordinates and to formulate recommendations for legislation. Congress may neither intrude on the President's ability to perform these functions, nor authorize private litigants to use the courts to do so. As this Court has construed the Federal Advisory Committee Act to avoid what the Court regarded and described as formidable constitutional questions, FACA does not permit the litigation and discovery the Respondents wish to pursue.",
  "I'm not sure I understand the thrust of your question.",
  "Well, with respect to the -- I'm not sure whether you are asking a question about the jurisdiction of the Court, because that's an issue that's before the Court, or with respect to construing the Federal Advisory Committee Act to avoid the constitutional questions that are implicit in that statute. We think that there is jurisdiction in this Court. We think that what the Court did in Public Citizen was make it very clear that because of the formidable constitutional questions, in fact, the Court referred to the constitutional questions in that case as undeniable. The Court construed the Federal Advisory Committee Act not to apply in that case. If that same rationale is applied here, the Court will not get to the constitutional question which FACA would inevitably raise if it intruded upon the President's power to obtain opinions from his subordinates, and to make recommendations to Congress with respect to legislation.",
  "That's true, Justice Ginsburg. This case fits squarely, we submit, within what the Court decided unanimously in the United States vs. Nixon for two reasons. In the first place, a denial of immediate review would render impossible any review whatsoever of the claims, the separation of powers claims that are being made here, because the Vice President -- and the Vice President is acting as the subordinate and surrogate for the President here. This is the President's authority.",
  "Yes, Justice Kennedy",
  "Well, it's not all fours in that sense, but the principle as articulated by the Court on pages 683 -- I mean 691 to 692. What the Court was concerned about there is that the traditional contempt avenue or any aspect of what would be required of the President of the United States to defy a court order would be both unseemly and would unnecessarily provoke a constitutional confrontation. What the Court said in that case, when we are talking about, when the Court is talking about important separation of powers questions, the President is in the position of having to defy a court order, risk sanctions of some sort.",
  "With respect, Justice Kennedy, this case, the separation of powers issue in this case goes far beyond the assertion of executive privilege. Executive privilege concerns itself with particular documents or a concern over the relationship that particular documents refer to. The objection here is to the process. The President and the Vice President are being subjected to litigation and discovery which goes far beyond what the statute would require here.",
  "We think, Mr. Chief Justice, that the de facto doctrine is wrong. It's inconsistent with Public Citizen, and if the Court were to construe -- find that somehow that the statute could be construed to create a de facto doctrine, which no court has ever done, finally done in connection with a case, that the case, the statute would be unconstitutional as it applied to these circumstances. However, Mr. Chief Justice, we believe that the Court does not need to get there by construing the statute narrowly, as the Court did in Public Citizen, unanimously, I might say, because three of the eight justices felt that the statute, if it were construed any other way, would be unconstitutional. Construing the statute in that fashion -­",
  "No. Not deal with it at all. I mean, the statute itself, we submit, addresses -- I think in the context of this case, Mr. Chief Justice, the statute may be construed in the context of a Presidential advisory group explicitly excluding a committee that's formed of all government employees, and as construed by the Court in that case, either -- the words used in the statute are established or utilized. As construed by that case, this commission was established by the President. It would be exempt on its face from application of FACA.",
  "We submit, Justice Scalia, that that would raise very serious constitutional questions. As an antecedent to that, there was no intention when Congress passed a statute to prohibit or regulate ex parte communications between the executive branch and members of the public.",
  "Well, I'm going to, I'm going to quote from the Public Citizen decision itself, which authoritatively and specifically defined the term or utilized in a way which would be flatly inconsistent with this question that you just raised. But I also want to mention, and would want to go on to say, that would require that the courts ignore the presumption of regularity which applies to the executive, particularly when the executive is performing core executive branch functions, which it clearly is in this case. But to get back to your question, the court in Public Citizen, on page 462, specifically defined what or utilized meant in that case. And defined it in this way, in order to avoid the undeniable formidable constitutional questions that would be raised if it was defined as you suggested. The Court said -­",
  "It seems to me in the context of this case, Justice Ginsburg, that once jurisdiction is acknowledged, the context of the case, the administrative record, which specifically contains within it the Presidential directive which created the advisory committee only to include members of the executive branch. The report of the committee, which specifically identifies as members only members of the executive branch, and the affidavit or declaration that's on file from the deputy director, which said that the only participants were members of the executive branch, and the presumption of reliability, of regularity that the Court consistently, U.S. vs. Armstrong is one case, the Court consistently, absent clear evidence to the contrary, accords executive branch action -­",
  "Well, but we are submitting that the discovery itself violates the Constitution, violates FACA as properly construed.",
  "Yes, because -­",
  "Unconstitutional if it -- if applied in these circumstances. Now, it may be construed -­",
  "Well, there is two answers to that -- at least two, Justice Souter. In the first place, the discovery was ordered by the District Court. It may be found at pages 215 to 220.",
  "Every effort was made with respect to the actions of the litigants in the District Court to refine it as much as possible. The District Court finally said this is what I order. I order the Petitioners not to file any dispositive motions. I order the Petitioners to respond to the discovery, to reply to nonprivileged discovery requests and assert executive privilege, which we are saying -­",
  "No. We did not. We did not.",
  "Well, I think that there is a very strong case that it should be, Justice Souter. The Court of Appeals addressed this issue, too, and said, well, the District Court might have been too broad. In fact, the Circuit Court, the Court of Appeals recognized the constitutional implications and then said, but maybe that can be narrowed down, but that the Respondents should be entitled to whatever discovery they need to prove their case.",
  "Well, it was -- I don't know what you mean by -­",
  "Yes, it did, Mr. Chief Justice, although it did say that the Government could assert privileges with respect to burden or executive privilege, and so forth. But if one looks at those discovery orders and they are in the joint appendix, they were much broader than the statute itself, broader than the relief that possibly could -­",
  "Inevitably what would have happened, because what the Court of Appeals said, and this is at Petition appendix 18-A of the Court of Appeals decision is that however refined the District Court's order would be, they would be, the Respondents would be entitled to whatever discovery they needed to prove their case. Now, what they need to prove their case, notwithstanding the presumption of regularity that the Court has always applied to the executive, absent clear evidence to the contrary, there is no clear evidence to the contrary here, Justice Ginsburg. All there is is a pure unadorned allegation which the Respondents say they get from media reports that there were contacts, nothing beyond that. But what they would need to prove, to prove their case is precisely what the District Court was going to allow them to utilize.",
  "In the form of -­",
  "Both, Justice Kennedy.",
  "This fits squarely within Nixon. When the Court said to require the President, and remember, we are talking about the President as the real party in interest, to place himself in the posture of disobeying a court order, merely to trigger the procedural mechanism.",
  "What we are dealing with here is the President -­",
  "When the -­",
  "Well, it certainly does when it involves the President or the Vice President in core constitutional functions. And U.S. vs. Nixon stands for the proposition when the President must choose between submission to an unconstitutional order, which participation in this discovery, the process of participation, having to prove every time the President consults with someone, to submit to litigation, and potentially submit to discovery, to submit to the violation of the separation of powers, or, or violate or challenge either sanctions or some order from the District Court.",
  "Justice Breyer -­",
  "We believe that it's much broader than executive -­",
  "Because the act of forcing the President to invoke executive privilege every time someone files a lawsuit, notwithstanding the presumption of regularity which was completely ignored here, that means that FACA would be used in every case to file a lawsuit to challenge the President and the Vice President's ability to -­",
  "To obtain opinions -­",
  "Potentially, Justice O'Connor.",
  "Because the Government was anxious -- because there was another way to resolve this whole problem, notwithstanding the denial of the 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.",
  "We submit that what the Government did here was try to work out the delicate constitutional problems that were involved here, the balancing of the executive's prerogative with the litigation function and that sort of thing, and to go the extra mile. I don't think the Court would want to encourage filing a mandamus or collateral order appeals every time there is a denial of a motion to dismiss.",
  "That's precisely correct, Mr. Chief Justice. The forcing of the President to submit to litigation and discovery, which if permitted in this case could be in any case comparable to it, any time advice is being sought from a citizen or from subordinates who may have then talked to citizens, notwithstanding the clear four corners of the directive when the President created the body within his own Administration from which he sought advice, every time there would be a lawsuit, every time they would say, well, Mr. President, come into court and claim executive privilege.",
  "There is two answers to that, one of which the Chief Justice suggested in his question. Executive privilege may not have covered every scrap of paper. It would have required the President and the Vice President to spend time with documents deciding whether or not to assert executive privilege. And it is the process -- more importantly than that, it is the process itself of submitting, as it would be if someone, if the Congress had applied this statute to the Supreme Court of the United States or even to itself, and then allowed litigants to bring the Court or members of Congress into court to explain why they wouldn't produce information with respect to who they talked to.",
  "Yes. There are several differences, Justice Kennedy. As I said at the very beginning, this discovery dispute involves bringing the President and the Vice President of the United States into court to defend themselves with respect to textually committed obligations and responsibilities that they have under the Constitution. Every other discovery dispute that I have experienced, and I submit this Court has experienced except for perhaps U.S. vs. Nixon, maybe another case, did not involve those circumstances. This is at -- this puts the President, in order to challenge the constitutionality of a process that's invasive to fundamental Presidential prerogatives and responsibilities into court to defend himself, notwithstanding the questionable constitutionality of the statute that triggers it, that mandamus may not be brought against the Vice President which is the -- the Federal Advisory Committee Act, it's worth mentioning, does not create a private right of action. The APA did not create a right of action against the Vice President here. So the litigants in this case, not having a right to even bring this case under the statute, then sought mandamus, it's important to mention.",
  "There are several answers to that. One, the agencies occupy a different statute under the APA. They occupy a different position under the Freedom of Information Act. And therefore, the obligations were different with respect to the President's core function. Arguments -­",
  "Yes, Mr. -- Justice Scalia, they would have been arguably available under FOIA, and they were produced under FOIA.",
  "There was more than one action, Justice Ginsburg. There were several FOIA actions brought against the various different departments.",
  "Yes. But the documents having already been produced and made available to the public under FOIA, it seemed to the government that would be foolhardy and unnecessarily confrontational and would serve no purpose whatsoever to withhold producing another set of those documents. Again, this is effort -­",
  "They were produced by agencies.",
  "Yes. And Mr. Chief Justice, if I may reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Justice Scalia. I was going to address that point because it's been addressed by Justice Souter, Justice Stevens, Justice Kennedy. What the discovery -- and I don't have time to read the interrogatories or the requests for admissions, but those require the production of all information with respect to any contacts at all between any member of the task force or any government employee that assisted with it or any agency -­",
  "Yes. Those were the discovery and requests for admissions. Now, the Court of Appeals didn't refine that. It said that, well, that's pretty broad, and it should be narrowed down, but it should be whatever is necessary to prove their case. They thought what was necessary to prove their case was to have all outside contacts. FACA does not require the production of that degree or that scope of documents. It has to do with minutes and drafts and things that were actually considered by the committee. So the discovery is vastly broader than the relief that would be available if FACA existed. Secondly -­",
  "It's -­",
  "Well, it's -­",
  "It's different, but it -- everything that they have asked for in those requests for admissions and those interrogatories, Justice Breyer, include everything they would get under FACA and a whole lot more. So -- and there is no question about that. Now, with respect to the subordinate working groups, a point was made with respect to the President's directive, that the President said the Vice President may establish subordinate working groups to assist. The declaration that's in the file at page 240 of the Joint Appendix specifically says that the Vice President authorized that, but the Vice President did not establish any such subordinate working groups. And then the declaration goes on to say that there was only a public citizen that was involved in developing graphics and that sort of thing. And that was the only person that was involved. No such individuals, the individuals named in the litigation, participated in the working group formulation. What we are saying here is that the constitutional immunity from discovery that we are talking about here is rooted in the overriding presumption of regularity, which, if repealed in this case, would repeal -- if overridden in this case would repeal the exemption under FACA for all government working groups. And these are exclusive functions, textually committed to the President of the United States getting opinions from his subordinates. As your question suggested, Justice Breyer, virtually anything that the President might do, asking the Attorney General or the Assistant Attorney General for this or that to formulate something, and they go out to talk to people, that could be a -- that would be a FACA lawsuit in a heartbeat. There is no statute that creates the right that the Petitioners seek here. There is no, there is no cause of action under FACA, and there is, no, Justice Stevens, no clear remedy, no clear right to which they are entitled to ministerial duty and therefore a remedy. And they just jumped over the fact that the statute didn't give them the right to bring this case and brought it in the form of mandamus. Mandamus is no substitute. It's not appropriate here. It's a pure circumvention of the statute. There is, we submit, no such thing as a de facto member of an advisory group under FACA. FACA was intended to address the creation of de jure working groups where the President would cloak himself in the benefit of public citizens who have come up with this proposal. It's not, I think your question, Justice Breyer, it's not a FOIA case. It's not a -­",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Kansas imposes a tax on the distributors of motor fuel.

An overwhelming majority of the fuel is not used on a reservation road; its used on the highways of the State of Kansas to get to the casino or to leave the casino. The road that's at issue in this case is 1.5 miles long. The rest of the driving, according to the record, is on the highways of Kansas. So, there's a clear difference there.

  "But the Kaul case, in the context of deciding whether other retailers there had standing, basically said that there was an economic impact that affected the retailers. The Kaul case specifically referred, Mr. Chief Justice, to the fact that the legislature had -- and this is on page 67 of the Pacific 2nd cite of the Kaul opinion -- the legislature amended the statute -- this is at the bottom of the second column -- or the first column -- to clarify the question where the incidence of taxation falls. The legislature provided that, unless otherwise specified, the incidence of the tax falls on the distributor. Then, Mr. Chief Justice, the court went on to evaluate the standing question and allowed the distributors the -- to raise the issue, because the economic burden did come through the distributors. It's important, in that context, to note that the ultimate burden of any of these taxes is not falling on the retailer, it's falling on the consumer. It's falling on the consumer of the gasoline. The consumer puts the gasoline in the car, and then the car is driven overwhelmingly -- the facts are unquestionable in this case -- overwhelmingly on the highways of the State of Kansas. So that the burden -- ultimately, the burden -­",
  "It still would be true. And -- but the fact is, in this case you have a -- off-reservation tax, on the -- all distributors -­",
  "It -- what the statute specifically says -- this is Section 3409 -- it says that the distributor may pass on -- \"may\" -- it's a permissive provision -- may pass on the cost of the taxation as a part of the cost of doing business. And, of course, the distributor does that with respect to the cost of its vehicles, the cost of other taxes it pays. It may include those provisions.",
  "I think what it means -- I understand, Justice Scalia, and I -- because I've had the same reaction, \"Well, of course he could. Why does he need a statute to do that? It is a cost of doing business.\" I think that provision is a part of the effort to make clear one of the factors that distinguishes this case from the Chickasaw Nation case, where the court found that it was significant that the distributor was required to pass on the tax, act as a collection agent for the retailer, and took a 1.5 percent commission. So, this court thought that might be significant. Kansas, in part, I think, want to make -- wanted to make it very clear that the -- what was happening in the economic chain is cost of production of gasoline, including tax paid by the distributor, could be passed on in the form of cost of business to the retailer. Now, of course its cost -- it passed on, also, to the consumer. The question -­",
  "It is unclear from this court's decisions precisely what \"legal incidence\" means. At least it was unclear to me as I was looking through the court's decisions. But I think it's a combination of the liability for the tax, the responsibility to pay the tax, the fact that -- in this case, the retailer has no liability for the tax. The only liability for the tax is on the distributor. The relationship is between the State of Kansas and the distributor. And all of those factors together make it clear to me, from this court's previous decisions, that \"legal incidence\" is a term of art, especially in the field of taxation. And, as the court pointed out in the Chickasaw Nation case, it's important to have a -­",
  "Well -­",
  "Well, the bright lawyer in Kansas who may have done that was the Kansas Legislature, following the unanimous decision of this court in Chickasaw Nation, saying, \"If you want to avoid the potential problems that would exist, change\" -- and it's not just the incidence of the tax, it's the legal incidence of the tax, it's -- of course, the economic burden of taxation is spread out throughout the chain of distribution. The legal incidence of the tax, as I read this court's opinions, are -- is, it is exactly what it is here, the distributor must pay for the tax, the distributor must account for the tax, the distributor is liable and may be penalized if the tax is not paid. Nobody else is liable for it. The distributor has to pay the tax even if it doesn't sell the gasoline. Here, not only the language is as clear as it could be -- I mean, the legislature specifically says it -- but the operation of the statute -- and the two -- the -- twice, the tenth circuit considered this -- the tenth circuit decided the legal incidence of the tax was on the distributor. The two district courts that decided it before those two tenth circuit decisions, decided that the legal incidence was on the distributor. The facts support that the legal incidence is on the distributor. And respondents, on page 16 of the respondent's brief, it seems to me, acknowledge precisely that. They, in their effort to distinguish the Central Machinery case, which is the Indian taxation statutes -- and we're not -­ specifically said there, referring to Central Machinery, \"The State tax was imposed on the sale of merchandise.

  "It may -- there may be some storage involved, there may be other occasions. But the fact is that the distributor files a monthly report describing how much fuel is -- it receives.",
  "Well, this is -- this is an effort by the legislature to say that fuel, which is going to be used in Kansas, by and large -- there's always going to be exceptions -- fuel that is used, by and large, in Kansas on the roads of Kansas, shall be subject to a tax so that those roads can be built and maintained. Now, how shall we, mechanically, impose and collect that tax? We will do it on the first receipt by the distributor.",

  "Well, I would say that the -- that if the -- this Court's prior decisions have any consistent meaning, that the person who has the obligation to pay the tax, and who might claim some credits or deductions, like we all do when we file our tax returns, the legal incidence of the tax is on us, as taxpayers. The taxpayer here is the distributor. The statute says so. The way the statute works -­",
  "I think -­",
  "-- I think, but I can't represent to you know that I know for sure, that that is an accounting process that takes place. Because these are transactions -- thousands of transactions that are taking place all of the time. Kansas also has a practical reason for imposing this tax on the distributors. There are X number of distributors. You can imagine how many times X there might be retailers and how many different disputes and so forth. The point -- one of the points that this Court has repeated made in connection with tax cases, and inter- sovereign immunity issues with respect to tax cases, is vitally important that there be certainty, predictability, and some understanding of fixed events with respect to taxation. States can't be engaged in litigation constantly, depending upon how many casino customers were here, how many people bought this gasoline, how many people bought that gasoline the next month, and how much did the tribe charge for the gasoline on its reservation. That kind of balancing process makes no sense whatsoever, and it -- and it sentences the States to litigation, and this Court to repeated decisions, based upon specific facts. That's why, we submit, that although the balancing is overwhelmingly in favor of the State, because it's a tax for gas that will enable someone to drive on roads that the State has to pay for, that, in this situation, one balancing test makes little sense. It simply invites litigation -­",

But it would like to have that and -- that tax -- and I'd like to save the balance of my time for rebuttal -- but that tax is overwhelmingly used on the roads of Kansas -- overwhelming used on the roads of Kansas -- which are paid for, built, and maintained with the revenue produced by that taxation. That's what it's for.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "The Kaul -­",
  "-- Kaul case? I read -- I don't think the Kansas Supreme Court could have been any more clear. It said the legislature amended the legislation to clarify where the incidence of taxation falls. It provided that the incidence of the tax falls on the distributor. Then, in Victa, in connection with the standing issue, because economic burden fell on the retailers, it found that the retailers and -- those other retailers had standing. Kansas could not have been more clear. In Section 3401(f)(3), it defines a \"distributor\" as someone who receives the product. In 3408(c), it's -- taxes the distributor on the first receipt of the tax. In 3410, it again says it's on the distributor. Two district courts and two courts of appeals found that the legal incidence of the tax was on the distributor. The Kansas Supreme Court said the same thing, the distributor is liable for the tax, pays the tax. The retailer has no liability for the tax. What in the world can Kansas do to make it clearer? Now, the Central Machinery case that's -- that my opponents have been speaking about is a case that was decided under the Indian Trader Statutes with respect to the trading with the Indians, with respect to Central Machinery case, was -- over tractors sold on the reservation for use on the reservation. It fell within the scope of the Indian Trader Statute. But this Court has made clear, in a number of cases, the Indian Trader Statutes would not remotely apply.",

  "There's an exemption for losses like -- one of the Court's questions with respect to a casualty loss or something that -- but it's limited. The liability, nonetheless, exists on the distributor.",
  "I think that -- I think the reading of the statute is plain. If the distributor took the fuel, kept it, decided to warehouse it because the costs are going up or something like that, it would still have to pay the tax, because the tax is on the receipt by the distributor. In answer to your question, Justice Stevens, Would those other exemptions, the United States Government be required by the Constitution, or the other States? No, not under this Court's decision in the Blaze case, which, as I understood it, was unanimous. The Fresno case, U.S. vs. New Mexico, it's not a tax on the United States. It's -- or an agency of the United States. So they wouldn't be required. But they make sense, because the sales to other States are for people that drive on other States' highways. The sales to the United States Government is an exchange for almost the same amount of money that comes back. So, there's a rational purpose. It's not discrimination. The tribe makes the point that it's generating real value and reservation value. This is fuel that's used in cars that are -- drive all over the State of Kansas. The casino is there, so people come to the casino. And, under Cabazon, there might be some value added by the casino, which, by the way, is an exempt value created by an exemption from regulation. But the value for someone who puts fuel in their car is so that that car will then drive. And that -- cars that drive, in this case, drive on Kansas highways. This, ultimately is -­",

  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondents dispute the wisdom, efficacy, and constitutionality of Ohio's franchise tax system, but they face two insurmountable obstacles in this Court. First, they cannot demonstrate any actual, concrete, and direct injury as a result of Ohio's investment tax credit to satisfy the irreducible minimum requirement for standing in this Court. Secondly, the facial Dormant Commerce Clause challenge that they bring is without merit. Ohio imposes no burdens or tariffs on interstate commerce. Its investment incentive program is available on equal terms to in-State, out-of-State, local, or interstate businesses. It is nondiscriminatory, and it stimulates, rather than impedes, commerce. Respondents are not injured when a business with which they do not compete receives a reduction in their taxes as a result of a tax credit. Respondents pay no higher taxes for products. They suffer no coercion because of a tax credit that is given to others. Their tax burden is not increased by Ohio's investment tax credit, nor will it be lessened if it is eliminated.",
  "I'm not sure, Justice Ginsburg. In some of this Court's Dormant Commerce Clause cases, competitors, who are arguably injured because they are paying a higher tax against the -- compared to the company that's receiving the benefit -- in a couple of cases, this Court has recognized customers of companies that are paying higher products, and, therefore, potentially higher prices, for the products that they purchase. And, in one or two cases, States have been recognized for purposes of standing. But --",
  "No, we don't think that at all. As this Court --",
  "Well --",
  "What -- Justice Scalia, I think the strongest statement is in the Valley Forge case, at page 489, where the Court said, \"If Respondents have no -- the argument that if Respondents have no standing to sue, no one would have standing, is not a reason to find standing.\" This would convert \"standing\" into a requirement that must be observed only when satisfied. But the fact is that under any standard articulated by this Court in its article III cases, the Respondents here do not having standing. The effect of the tax is very \"uncertain, hypothetical, or speculative,\" to use the words of this Court, with respect to them. They cannot demonstrate that they are affected by it. And as --",
  "Well, nonetheless, the Court made that distinction in the Flast case with respect to the Establishment Clause, and, specifically, the spending and taxing powers exercised by Congress. And the Court determined, in that case, that the Establishment Clause was a specific limitation on spending authority. The Court has been very careful, and many Justices of this Court, individually, have said that that distinction in that case will not be extended beyond the Establishment Clause, in the context of spending, in connection with a religious conviction, or the establishment of a religion. The Court has indicated, frequently, I think, that that is not going to be extended. At any rate, it wouldn't be extended -- the logic of Flast wouldn't be applicable here anyway. This is not an application of the spending power by Congress or the taxing power by Congress. This is the Commerce Clause, which is a permissive grant of authority to Congress, and, at most, under the Dormant Commerce Clause, a limitation on the States. These respondents are not remotely close to what this Court has said are the irreducible minimums. Even if they --",

We don't believe that there would be standing under State court taxpayer or State -- Ohio jurisprudence, either. If I may, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. In the first place, this is article III standing that we're talking about, not prudential considerations of standing, as the Court made very clear in Valley Forge, where a taxpayer seeks to employ a Federal court to air grievances about the conduct of Government or the allocation of power in the Federal system. The \"case and controversies\" requirement of article III is not met. With respect to the issue of municipal taxpayer standing, the Court would have to determine that that did exist, something that has not happened before, and then would piggyback onto that claim a challenge to a separate tax by a separate Government under a separate claim arising out of a separate transaction. The deal between DaimlerChrysler and Toledo was separate from the tax granted by the investment tax credit under the State's system. Respondents state, in the first page of their brief, that, because all of these States do these things, these investment tax credits have only minimal effect on business transactions. That's the first page of their brief. That's harmful to their standing, that's harmful to their Commerce Clause challenge. Ohio only taxes in-State activity. It uses a constitutionally appropriate apportionment formula to determine how much of the interstate business's activity is attributable to Ohio, and only taxes that. So that if there is a benefit given because someone comes to the State and builds a plant there, it may result, actually, in increased taxes in Ohio, because the plant will raise the proportion of business being done in Ohio. But what Ohio does not do is -- what this Court has held unconstitutional -- is, tax the out-of-State activity, or burden the out-of-State activity, or make interstate commerce itself more burdensome. As the Court has pointed out in questions, Justices have pointed out in questions, this same issue could be raised with respect to the State of Nevada. There's no franchise tax in the State of Nevada, and same with other States. Some States offer accelerated permitting requirements or relaxed environmental rules or different educate -- employment standards, all matters of State regulation. This Court has said that competition between States for commerce lies at the heart of a free-trade society. That is what's going on here. States are competing with appropriate permissive incentives to do business within the State. This is, as this Court said, a laudable purpose for State activity. What the Respondents would do would nationalize State tax systems. You couldn't have a more beneficial tax system in Massachusetts than in Ohio, because that would provide some sort of a burden, under the Respondent's theory. The same with other regulations by States of business. We would have a system where this Court would be deciding -- all States would have to have uniform taxation, uniform systems of regulations, the very antithesis of federalism.",
  "Now, what I would --",
  "If you have your dog in Wisconsin, you may pay whatever --",
  "-- Wisconsin decides --",
  "If --",
  "That would be --",
  "That would be something this Court would be severely concerned with.",
  "Well, again, that's -- and I think that goes to Justice Souter's point, that there's a relationship between the tax system and the investment. We should end on the point that every -- virtually every State has this kind of system, not just because of competition with States, but to find the right location, a depressed area within a State. And this is important with respect to businesses in the United States competing with foreign countries.",
  "We don't believe that the Dormant Commerce Clause stands the -- stands for the proposition that these regulations should be nationalized.",
  "Thank you, Justice Stevens. May it please the Court: The limited monopoly granted by U.S. patent laws protects against the making, using or selling a patented invention within the United States. Section 271(f) also makes it an infringement to make components of a patented invention within the United States and then simply ship them abroad for reassembly.",
  "No, I don't believe so, Justice Scalia.",
  "This is by no means a trumped-up suit. It's a very serious suit. The outcome, the judgment, the amount of damages that must be paid is not a matter of wager. It depends upon the decision of a matter of law of an interpretation of a statute of the United States.",
  "This is an entirely legitimate, I submit, means by which parties may preserve a legal issue depending upon how a legal question is decided. The only thing that's been resolved is the amount that will be paid as damages depending upon the outcome of the appeal.",
  "It seems to me, Justice Scalia, that it happens frequently, especially in criminal cases where there is -- someone pleads guilty in and preserving a right to appeal a certain issue. I don't have a case to cite to you but it strikes me as quite understandable that the parties might agree if the outcome of the legal question that the judge might decide is going to be X, then the consequence will be a liability for Y. If it's -- if it's of the opposite outcome, the outcome will be different. That's - -",
  "Well, I think that if the amount - -",

  "In this case, notwithstanding the limitation of in Section 271(f) that the components, there's -- liability of the components are created here, and reassemble the broad. The Federal Circuit held that foreign made tangible reproductions of computer operating code installed in foreign-made computers may be components which are deemed or essentially supplied from the United States, because copying is part and parcel of software distribution, and thus subsumed in the act of supplying. Under this ruling, U.S. companies may be held liable for patent infringement whenever their products are copied or replicated abroad. This - - the court of appeals decision and the position of Respondents requires reworking several words in the statute. The statute says supplied from the United States. The court of appeals said, well, it might be deemed supplied from the United States after it's copied abroad. The Respondent takes the words \"such components\" in the statute and reads them as not the same components.",
  "It is being copied. There isn't any question that it's being copied, Justice Stevens. The stipulation which is in pages 44-A through 47-A of the petition appendix contains the words -- this is words to which respondent stipulated -- foreign-made copies replicated object code, foreign manufactured copies, foreign replicated object code. What happens, Justice Stevens, is that the golden master of the disk which contains the physical manifestation of the object code is read by a machine somewhere outside the United States, looked at and then copied onto another physical medium, either a hard drive or a disk.

  "The -- if I may answer that by saying that people use the word \"software\" in two different ways. One of which, they use it as the intangible series of 1's and 0's.

As I understand it, Justice Souter, and I think the stipulations make this clear, there's a reference in the stipulations to encoded transmissions but there's a -- but the parties also agree that's the same process as the golden disk. The golden disk is sent abroad. That is read by a machine and then the machine understands -- it's almost as if you were to read physically any other type of document, read it to a machine. The machine understands what is said, puts it into a physical manifestation on a disk or on a hard drive. Many copies are made in that fashion. They are installed in computers made abroad, sold to foreign purchasers.",
  "Of the foreign? The language of the statute is the foreign manufactured product. Those are the computers that are sold abroad. It is our position that the only components that are in issue in this case are the physical manifestations of the object code on a hard drive or on a disk.",
  "That's correct. And the -- the thing that's on the disk in the foreign - -",
  "Justice Kennedy - -",

  "That's correct, Justice Scalia.",
  "An idea or a principle, two plus two equals four can't be patented. It has to be put together with a machine and made into a usable device. The bind that AT&T is in here is that the components that make the machines run that are produced abroad are not supplied from the United States. They are made in Belgium or Frankfurt or something.",
  "They have attempted, Justice Ginsburg, with respect, to have it both ways. They've said that it is a physical and structural thing, something that's on the golden master disk. And then they say it's just the binary code in the abstract, but that in the abstract never becomes a part of the computer.",
  "Yes. I agree with you. The Federal Circuit was ambiguous, in part because there were two separate decisions. The court considered the component issue in the Eolas case and then when this case came along, said we've already decided the component portion of the statute; now we must decide the supplied from. So the language which the Federal Circuit used is a bit confusing. Basically what it said, though, is that the act of supplying embraces the act of copying. That means that any, any company sending a machine or a patented product abroad, that that machine must be copied in order to be mass produced abroad. It might be a pill. It might be a mousetrap. It might be a Buick. That exact identical copy if replicated abroad does not violate the statutes, the patent laws, it doesn't constitute an infringement.",
  "If it reproduces itself, Justice Kennedy, somewhere outside the United States - -",
  "What you're suggesting is that there is a pattern or a recipe or a template or a mold. It could be the same thing. If it's reproduced outside the United States by some laboratory outside the United States, then the components are not being sent from the United States for reassembly abroad.",
  "I think there are three answers to that. Surely the patent laws cannot be determined according to whether it's easy or fast or efficient to replicate something. There has to be a line that makes some sense. Number two, it may be fast and efficient but there are certainly costs involved in taking the machines to do it. Number three, where would that take us? A design -- every product contains its own manifestation of its design. That would take us everywhere, because any product can be copied abroad. However -- and maybe there are going to be fast ways to produce other things. These are replicas, reproductions, copies. These are not such components that are supplied from the United States. If I may reserve the balance of my time? Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Justice Scalia. I mean Justice Stevens. I was about to address Justice Scalia and recite the case -- cite the case Nixon versus Fitzgerald, which is directly responsive to the question Justice Scalia raised at the very beginning of the audience, that a stipulation with respect to damages does not make a case moot. And also with respect to a question raised by Justice Scalia, or a comment made by him, it doesn't have to be gold. It's a master disk.",
  "What this essentially comes down to is something that Mr. Waxman repeatedly said. It is the commands that are a component. The commands to the individual foreign made computers. Those are -- those commands cannot be understood and cannot be used by that computer unless they are in a physical medium that is created as a copy of the master disk that sends abroad -- that's sent abroad. As I said at the beginning, the stipulation is full of the word \"copies\", foreign replicated copies. That's what we're talking about here, something that is recreated. And Justice Breyer, your question about someone who's got a really good memory and can go abroad and recite the 1's and 0's, pictures can be taken, copies can be made in lots of different ways.

Copies of the object code were put on physical mediums and sent to domestic manufacturers.

  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The per se illegality rule for resale price maintenance is widely recognized to be outdated, misguided and anticompetitive. It should be replaced with the same rule of reason standard that applies to other forms of vertically imposed marketing restrictions. The Sherman Act bars only unreasonable restraints of trade and the court presumptively applies a rule of reason analysis to determine whether a restraint is unreasonable. Per se rules should be rare and imposed only where the court is virtually certain based upon considerable economic experience that a practice is nearly invariably anticompetitive. Vertical minimum retail -- resale price maintenance are plainly not invariably anticompetitive. In fact, a broad consensus of economists and decisions of this Court recognize that vertical restraints promote interbrand competition, which is the goal of the antitrust laws and are rarely, if ever, anticompetitive.",
  "Well, the economists who have looked at the use of resale price maintenance have said that that would very rarely, if ever, be the case. It certainly could not be the case in this industry in connection with this participant in the marketplace. There are something like 5,000 dealers that the Brighton products are sold through. There are thousands and thousands of other competing dealers, hundreds of products. What the Court has said repeatedly is that programs such as this may promote interbrand competition, perhaps - -",
  "No. I think that that would be covered by a horizontal prohibition, Justice Stevens.",
  "I think it would be, as horizontal restraint among competing dealers, it could be a per se violation under horizontal rules if it was -- if it was -- involved the manufacturer in some way, it could be dealt with by the rule of reason.",
  "What this Court said in Sylvania, and said again in the State Oil versus Khan, is that the manufacturer has very, very little incentive to increase - -",
  "Because the motivation for the arrangement, if it comes from a manufacturer -- you're suggesting a hypothetical in which all of the dealers in a particular area would get together to impose this on a manufacturer. I think it's very unrealistic that that would happen.",
  "I think that if the manufacturer makes a decision, whether it's because dealers would like to see that happen or not, as this Court said in Business Electronic versus Sharp Electronics, there's of course relationships between the dealers and the manufacturers, that the dealers may have an interest in doing this, because they may find for the same reason that the manufacturer does that it promotes the sales of products. The record is clear in this case that this was an effective strategy for the Brighton company, the Brighton Leegin company that's manufacturing the Brighton products, to enter a very difficult and highly competitive marketplace, and it was successful.",
  "Well, it might be a situation, the economists have written about this, say that it would be very rare, and would require retailers with a strong powerful market power to impose a situation where the manufacturer would do that to help facilitate a horizontal cartel. That certainly was not involved in this case, and that would probably be found to violate the rule of reason. In addition, it would probably be unlawful under the horizontal rules established by this Court. That was not an issue in this case. The economists say that that would very seldom happen.",
  "Well - -",
  "Well - -",
  "In, in the vast majority of the economist whose have looked at this have come out to the opposite conclusion, Justice Breyer. Secondly - -",
  "No. No. I think that - -",
  "But what this Court -- what this Court has repeatedly said, that under circumstances such as this where there's a consensus among leading respected economists, that is one factor. There's another factor - -",
  "This is one factor that the Court should consider and the Court has considered in the past when dealing with something that the Court itself has said, is an anachronistic and chronologically schizoid rule, to have a rule of reason for certain vertical restraints and a fixed, rigid, per se rule with respect to other vertical restraints. The Court -- the Court itself has made those pronouncements. The enforcing agencies have changed their view with respect -- and they are here today, the Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission, all of whom have announced that they believe that it is very rare for a rule such as this, for an arrangement such as this to be anticompetitive.",
  "Essentially, the same argument was made in the Sylvania -- at the time of the Sylvania case. The same argument was made just a term or two go in connection with the Illinois Tool case that dealt with tying arrangements. The same argument was made in State Oil versus Khan. This Court has construed the antitrust laws as an expression by Congress that the courts should be aware of the dynamic potential in the marketplace - -",
  "The repeal of those statutes, Justice Ginsburg, repealed per se legality rules. It was not a congressional expression against the rule of reason - -",
  "Yes, you did.",
  "And that was a, that was one factor, however, Justice Stevens. I think, as I read that opinion, the Court was also concerned with the fact that the, the per se rule which -- and the Court said the statement thing just a few weeks ago in the Weyerhaeuser case -- to the extent there's practices that can be procompetitive, the Court should not set a low threshold of illegality, especially low per se illegality threshold. There were -- there have been - - it is worth emphasizing that the Court has repeatedly said we don't want per se rules when we don't have a substantial body of economic experience that shows us that this practice - -",
  "There's really no evidence that the marketplace as it exists today is a result of the Dr. Miles rule of 1911, Chief Justice - -",
  "Actually I looked into that, Justice Souter. And me, my limited historical research is that the -- those discounters were coming on strong before 1975 which is when the, the consumer price, whatever it was, act was passed in response to that. There are -- the evidence basically shows that -- and this Court has said -- that it's interbrand competition that ultimately produces lower prices.",
  "Well, a number of things have changed. The -- the number of respected individuals, notwithstanding that book, who have looked at it and have focused on the marketplace, have said that because it allows -- it increases the possibility of interbrand competition, it can provide incentives for dealers to provide service, differences in the products. And other things that have happened since then, are this Court's decision in the Sylvania case, which -- which involved an elaborate analysis of vertical restrictions and found that they are largely procompetitive and undermine the ruling -- the reason for a per se rule. This Court's decision in State Oil versus Khan, and the other cases that this Court is very well aware of where per se rules have systematically been dismantled because they are artificial themselves in the marketplace. This - -",
  "Did you say inter - -",
  "Well, I don't know that -- I don't know whether people like competition. But the antitrust laws like competition and this Court likes competition. And this Court has said that interbrand - -",
  "Well, the manufacturer is very unlikely to do this for the convenience of the retailers, to -- because it's in the interest of the manufacturer to have the retail price as low as possible so that the manufacturer will sell as many of the manufacturers' products as possible.",
  "No.",
  "Yes, yes, it is.",
  "Precisely.",
  "That's -- that's absolutely correct.",
  "I -- I agree completely. I would like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal, but let me say that that's what this Court has said over and over again. If you -- the purpose of the antitrust laws is not price, but it's competition, because competition between competing manufacturers give the consumers more choice. Some people may want the cheapest product. Some people may want the product that's more available to them. They may wish the return policy or the warranty policy or the repair policy that the dealer provides. And in this marketplace particularly, that system of providing competition is consistent with the antitrust laws and has produced success in the marketplace.",
  "This -- but the case was never litigated on that basis. It wasn't considered on that basis in the Court of Appeals. It came up sort of as a late thought in the opposition to the petition for certiorari. But that is not this case. The case was litigated on the per se rule of Dr. Miles.",
  "The Respondent and its amici seem to recognize that what this Court said in State Oil versus Khan, that a vertical restraint imposed by a single manufacturer or wholesaler may stimulate interbrand competition even as it reduces intrabrand competition and, by the way, it enhances intrabrand competition on matters of service and availability and other things in addition to price. The Respondent and their amici seem to have acknowledged these pro-competitive factors but say you should do it by a contract with 5,000 different retailers, which you then have to go out and enforce, or you have to do it under a Colgate system, which the Ping brief demonstrates it's a blunt instrument, it requires terminating retailers with which you had a relationship for years, it prohibits even talking to the loyal retailers to fix small problems.",
  "Pardon me?",
  "No. What we're suggesting is that the agreement is something, the details can be worked out. The manufacturer can -- and the Ping brief explains this. The manufacturer can go to the retailer and say: Look, maybe you didn't get it right, your sales person said the wrong thing; let's fix it, because we want to be dealing together. The antitrust laws - - in other word, what the Respondent and its amici want or they suggest forward integration, so you just acquire all your retailers. The benefits of these type of arrangements provide the consumers with choices. It stimulates interbrand competition. It promotes intrabrand competition on things other than price. It provides consumers with more choices. It ultimately gives more freedom to the manufacturer to stimulate the sale of its products, to enter the marketplace. These are things that the Court has said, and provides a more varied market price. The court has repeatedly raid that the presumptive rule is a rule of reason. Per se rules should be crossed out or not adopted unless they're dealing with a practice which is invariably anticompetitive. This practice, as acknowledged, is procompetitive. It provides many opportunities, and it is irrational for vertical restrictions to exist in this world in the non-price area or the maximum price area as subject to the rule of reason and the minimum retail price maintenance under a rigid per se rule that cannot be changed. And as this Court has repeatedly held, Congress intended by the use of restraint of trade and the unreasonable restraint of trade for this court to continue to breathe life into the restrictions of the antitrust laws in the benefit of the consumer and in the benefit of competition, eliminating rigid per se rules which make it unlawful for a manufacturer to do something that's rational in the marketplace, to give consumer choices, or to do it in some indirect way that is a lawyer's dream and an entrepreneur's nightmare makes no sense at all. For all those reasons, the rule of reason in this area, as in the other areas, should replace the per se rule which is rigid and anticompetitive at the end of the day. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The heart of this lawsuit is that official FTC tar and nicotine ratings generated by testing performed by Respondents under the FTC's supervision and transmitted to the public in Respondent's advertising at the FTC's insistence is misleading; therefore, the creation and transmission of the allegedly misleading data for which Respondents are being sued were acts performed by Respondents to assist the FTC in performing its official responsibilities.",
  "No. The FTC did not do it through a regulation. If the Court were to look at pages 93 to 110 of the Joint Appendix, you would see testimony by the Chairman of the FTC and the head of the consumer protection part of the FTC saying: We chose not to do it by regulation because we found that it was much more efficient, much more fast, and much for effective to force the tobacco companies into what is called a voluntary agreement requiring precisely that information.",
  "Yes, it would. In a 1978 advisory opinion, which is found on pages 202 of the joint appendix, the FTC stated categorically -- and the joint appendix, by the way, Justice Souter, is full of exactly what I'm talking about. The FTC said tar values in cigarette advertising must be consistent with the latest FTC number and stated that it would be deceptive to advertise higher numbers or lower numbers or different numbers. In other words, the enforcement wouldn't be through the enactment of a regulation. The FTC -- again, I refer to the testimony of the Chairman",
  "The source of the FTC number is the FTC test, alternatively called the Cambridge filter test.",
  "But the FTC calls it the FTC test. It was devised by the FTC. It has a specific set of requirements. The FTC itself performed that test for a number of years. Then in 1987 the test was transmitted -- the FTC stopped doing it and allowed the industry to do it itself because the -- again, in that same testimony by the Chairman of the Commission, he said that: It will be more effective and easier for us, and we can use our funds for other purposes if the industry does it.",
  "It's fairly -- what happened, it's fairly clear from what the FTC has said, they would bring an action for deceptive advertising if there was anything involved in the marketing of those cigarettes that had to do with tar and nicotine levels.",
  "No, they wouldn't. But that is not of course this case. This case involves - -",
  "The history of that is set forth in the record and it's clear.",
  "And the answer is that the FTC announced a proposed rule. It then sent a letter to the tobacco companies saying, it would be much easier for us and much easier for you to enter into a voluntary agreement. It gave them 30 days to come up with a voluntary agreement. They produced an agreement which the FTC rejected because it allowed certain flexibility with respect to the testing and didn't adhere specifically to the FTC test that you're referring to. It rejected that first agreement. The tobacco companies came back with another agreement. The FTC accepted that agreement and said that it would enforce the voluntary agreement against the tobacco companies and if they deviated from it they'd return to the rulemaking process.",
  "Let me see if I can answer that question, Justice Ginsburg. This is not merely compliance with the rule. This is not merely testing of products. The FTC created the standard. It created the testing mechanism. It performed the tests according to very detailed criteria. Those tests are now performed by the industry for the FTC. Those test results must be reported to the FTC. The FTC then reports those results to Congress and publishes them in the Federal Register as the official FTC tobacco ratings, and then the FTC requires - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, yes, Justice Scalia. And in the case that you - -",
  "It's not careless. They are pronouncing the facts. And in a case that you participated in in the D.C. Circuit, the brief in that case, the Brown and Williamson case that was mentioned before Justice Bork wrote the opinion, in that brief I counted -- I stopped counting about 10 or 12 times after the words \"the FTC test methodology,\" the \"FTC official ratings,\" the FTC this, the FTC that.",
  "Let me try again, Justice Ginsburg. If the FTC had said to four local hospitals, please perform this test according to this specification for us, the FTC, and then give us these results, which we will then publish as the FTC official ratings of cigarettes, and then if those hospitals were sued because the testing and the results were alleged to be misleading, I think even the government would admit that that case could be removed under the Federal officer removal statute. There is nothing - -",
  "No. It would be a vastly different situation.",
  "The difference, the difference is, is that, A, the test is, is -- the FTC and the record is full of this, too; the FTC set a goal for itself very early in the regulatory process. It wanted consumers to purchase lower tar and nicotine cigarettes. Now how was it going to accomplish that, the FTC goal? It devised this test. It made it official FTC test. Official FTC ratings. What this is doing is conscripting in a way or accepting here's what the - -",
  "Well, in, in 29 -- this is in the record. The FTC set forth goals, it's 29 Federal Register 530, in -- on January 22, 1964, that the FTC described its goal as to encourage the development of less hazardous cigarettes. That was done in conjunction with a earlier or a contemporaneous -- nearly contemporaneous Surgeon General report which is reported at joint appendix pages 57 to 60, that the Government had as its goal the responsible promotion of cigarettes low in tar and nicotine. Now I'm not saying - -",
  "The Government says that the test is -- is, that if an individual, private actor, is assisting the Federal Government in performing the official Government function, the case is appropriate to be removed. That is what the Government says section 1441(a)(1) means. This Court has said that section shall be liberally construed, not narrow or limited in its construction, and not frustrated by a narrow, grudging interpretation.",
  "The apple lookers' device?",
  "Ah, but Justice Breyer, what happens here is they say you do it yourself, and the Chairman of the -- Chairman of the FTC said why. Here's why; he said it's better undertaken by private researchers. It's a mechanism that we can rely on to ensure accurate reporting. Then, what the FTC did is to supervise the performance of the test. It goes into the laboratories. It makes sure it has done it its way. And then it accepts those results - -",
  "But we're -- we're not. We're suggesting -- you're -- what you're doing in your question and your statement is to disaggregate the pieces of the process here. Here it is the FTC's goal, it's FTC's method; it's the FTC's test which is supervised but done by the companies. And then it becomes the FTC official ratings which they then must transmit to the company in their advertising. And now they're sued because those ratings that they've done according, for the FTC, according to the FTC standards, are alleged to be misleading. So it's -- it's not possible to disaggregate it. It is a whole spectrum; the testing itself and the reporting -- is done by the industry because the FTC wants it as its official numbers, and it wants its official numbers given to the consumers. And it is setting an advisory opinion, even if you tell them that your cigarettes have higher tar or lower tar, if you don't report our numbers, you will be sued for deceptive advertising.",
  "What I was saying in answer - -",
  "I think so. Let me restate it, because I think I understand what you've said. And I think what I was trying to say with respect to Justice Ginsburg's question, if the -- all those private hospitals did it, I think the Government would admit, the Federal -- and then is there an exception in the statute? If the regulated entity, in this case the tobacco company, does it rather than the hospital? And there's nothing in the statute that says that.",
  "The Agency decided they are any --",
  "Yeah.",
  "This is, as the Eighth Circuit said, a very unusual situation. But the closest analogies are, are to the Government contractor cases. And by the way, it doesn't require a contract to be acting under the supervision. I heard the Government say that what you had to have is someone supervised by the Government with the Government's power to alter the actor's conduct.",
  "Justice, I understand there's a distinction. Because the Government is the actual consumer of that product. But here the Government announced that its goals were to accomplish a market in lower tar cigarettes. And it said with respect to the testing, it's better undertaken by private researchers. So it was fulfilling the Government's desire to have something they could save the money, if they close down the laboratory, they said in this testimony, we'll use the money for enforcement pumps against the cigarette company. We can regulate and determine, fulfill the official functions of the Government more effectively, more efficiently if we do it this way. So it is the Government's objective. It is the Government's results they are seeking to obtain. And they've conscripted voluntarily the industry to do the thing for it and then it calls it its official results.",
  "I don't know the answer to that. I think the answer is no. I think that what, what the FTC was able to accomplish at that time was to get every -- the major players in the marketplace with respect to participation in this. I don't know - -",
  "That's the private hospital example that we were talking about.",
  "I don't know that it would be stronger. Why would it be weaker - -",
  "Well, that happens to be - - there happens to be a coincidence of what the Government wants to accomplish and what the industry is willing to and wants to accomplish. I'll accept that. So does that mean there's an exception to the Federal officer removal statute, if the person who is asked to help the Government, does help the Government, is sued because his actions in helping the Government occasioned someone to bring a law suit?",
  "Well, in the first place if there's anything in the complaint that allows a removal then the case can be removed. That's the Exxon versus Allapattah case that the Court decided just a couple of terms ago. But secondly, let me address directly what you are saying. Throughout the complaint, in the complaint itself, I found references to the testing machine or method eight times in the complaint. They say -- they complain about representations that cigarettes contain less tar and nicotine than regular cigarettes. They base that on the test results. They then say as measured by the industry standard testing apparatus. And let me refer to what the Petitioners said in their motion to remand to the State court. They complained -- they said the basis of this complaint is misleading low tar and nicotine ratings as measured by the company's testing procedures. That's in the Petitioners' motion to remand. Furthermore, the district court interpreted the complaint precisely the way we are explaining this to the Court today. The district court said that over and over again, words of the district court at page 42a of the petition appendix, the court concludes that the FTC's regulation of the cigarette companies' testing and advertising cuts to the heart of the plaintiff's lawsuit. Well, the heart of the plaintiff's lawsuit is testing and advertising. The testing is required by the FTC. The results of the testings are the FTC's numbers. And the advertising contains the FTC's numbers because the FTC requires it. The circuit court interpreted - -",
  "I don't deny that the -- the Respondents in this case are engaged in industry. A regulated industry by the FTC. And that's correct, Justice Ginsburg. I don't think there's an exception. And the Government hasn't suggested there's an exception in the Federal officer removal statute because someone happens to be in the industry which is asked to help the Government perform a particular function. There is no logic to that, and it certainly would be not a liberal interpretation of the Federal officer removal statute. The circuit court also said the very -- and I think this is worth noting, at page 15a of the appendix to the cert petition, the very combination the plaintiff challenges as deceptive is the same combination the FTC requires not to be -- to put in your advertising in order not to be deceptive. So what is required by the FTC of the plaintiffs, the advertising of these test -- official test results -- is precisely what the Petitioners say, and the Petitioners say is deceptive. That's the basis for their lawsuit.",
  "If the - -",
  "Well, it is a good preemption argument, Justice Scalia. That will be played out either in the State court, depending upon how you rule, or the Federal court. But it's -- that's the nexus and the color of Federal authority that you talked about in your dissenting opinion in that Acker case. The Court in the Acker case, Jefferson County versus Acker, said that the allegations in the petition and in the removal petition must be -- and especially since they weren't challenged in this case, the factual allegations and the characterization of the complaint were not challenged in this case -- must be accepted as true by this Court. And Chief Justice Roberts, it's not only the allegations in the complaint and the characterization in the removal petition, but it's what the district court decided the complaint said.",
  "No, I don't think so. I think --",
  "Yes, it is. And this is an appropriate case for evaluation of the conduct of the person acting - -",
  "Yes. Yes. There is. But as I said, that is not -- I mean, the part of the complaint, as the district court saw it and the circuit court saw it, is much more than that. It's the testing and so on and so forth. And I don't think it would make any difference because even if there's an allegation, which there is in the complaint, that the test was manipulated or gained or circumvented, it goes back to whether it's a good test or not.",
  "Well, it may perhaps be. But what, it's an interpretation of the statute. I don't think there's any doubt about that anyway, Chief Justice Roberts, because it's clear that what was being done here is something that the FTC wanted done in the way the FTC wanted it done. I don't know how the -- I believe that the preemption argument is very, very strong, because the lawsuit, the substance, the guts, the core, the heart of the lawsuit, as the district court said and the Eighth Circuit said is, you're doing what the FTC required you to do, and the plaintiffs say that it's deceptive. And by the way, it's very clear from the record in the joint appendix and in the district court decision and in the remand in the motion -- the motion to -- the petition to remove, that the FTC knew exactly the deficiencies that are alleged in the complaint. The FTC has been aware of the fact that people smoke differently, that cigarette -- the design of a cigarette may affect the outcome of the test. But what the FTC, knowing that full well, said, well, people might smoke things differently and you might get more tar and nicotine than the FTC ratings produce. And the FTC with full awareness said, we understand all that, but what we want is for the consumers to have an ability to compare this cigarette with this cigarette, and we have devised a test that will allow you to compare an apple to an apple. Now there are other things that will --",
  "That is the case. I don't know if you've charactered it the same way I did, but the apples to apples thing is tied in with your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, about the apple inspectors.",
  "It's the Tobacco Institute testing facility - -",
  "It's a facility of the tobacco industry. The FTC perceives it as -- these industries -- and these companies, and as I said, even the petitioners in their remand petition are challenging the low tar and nicotine rate measured by the company's testing procedures. So yes, I'd like to have it be something different but it isn't something different. It is what the companies have done, and through this mechanism. This case comes down to the fact that the FTC wanted certain things done. It decided how certain things would be done. It calls the results of those the official FTC ratings. It wants those ratings delivered to the people. And the tobacco companies have done that and they're being sued because they say -- because that information which they're delivering, that they're creating and delivering at the request of the Government, is alleged to be deceptive. This is the perfect case for a removal under the federal officer removal statute.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For 10 years, New York relied on political party primaries to nominate general election candidates for supreme court justice, but that process discouraged qualified candidates and spawned unseemly, expensive, and potentially corrupting fundraising by judicial candidates. So the legislature substituted an indirect party primary system at which delegates are elected who, in turn, select general election candidates at political party conventions. The Second Circuit concluded that the delegate convention statutes enabled political parties to exercise too much influence at the expense of the insurgent party members or insurgent candidates and struck those statutes down as facially unconstitutional and reinstated the discredited primary process. The issue in this case is whether the delegate-convention system is facially unconstitutional because it allows party leaders to defeat the aspirations of party insurgents. States have broad, as this case has repeatedly held -- broad constitutional latitude to prescribe the time, place, and manner of elections, particularly elections for State office.",

But at that point in time the process was that there was an open blanket primary, which was not held unconstitutional at that point, where the major candidates -- the one and two positions of the major candidates of each of the political parties would get on the ballot, and then the Socialist Party was complaining because it took 1 percent of the votes of the primary process to get on the general election ballot. This Court held that that -- that that was not an impossible burden, and that -- the principle from that case and the other cases, the American political - - American Party of Texas v. White and so forth, the Court's jurisprudence has held that, as long as there is reasonable access for a candidate or a political party to the general election process, then it does not have to be provided in that level in the primary.",

Your primary election cases talk in terms of, the ones that have been mentioned in the briefs here, talk particularly in terms of protection under the Equal Protection Clause. This is -- it's called a primary, but it's an election of delegates by party members that -- and then, when those delegates get together, they go to the convention.

An individual might become a delegate himself by -- or herself, by getting 500 names on a signature, and that's far below what this Court has indicated before was -- was an acceptable level of requirement of access to the ballot. An individual can attempt to form delegate slates, can attempt to persuade the delegates, can -- the individual can form or switch parties. In this case the Respondent Lopez Torres, actually in the 2003 election, became a candidate at the general election for supreme court justice of the Working Families Party, and she did that without giving up her registration and membership in the Democratic Party. She was in that election and she lost. Finally, and this is even if she hadn't been able to secure the nomination of that political party, she could run in the general election. There's access to -- it takes 3500 to 4,000 signatures to run as an independent body in the general election. So there is way after way after way for individuals in New York to participate in the election process. So in answer to your question, Justice Kennedy, to the extent that your statement of the principle with respect to access to both the primary and the general election is -- is the law of this Court, then that access exists here. But I come back to the point that political parties have the greatest possible latitude -- yes, Justice Scalia, that the Court has upheld certain restrictions with respect to how the nominee of the party gets selected. But the Court has also said that when the party is in that process, its powers and rights and First Amendment freedoms to elect the standard-bearer, to select the standard-bearer, are at their apogee, because the person selected as a candidate, whether that person might be the most favorable person to the rank and file, the duly elected leadership of the political party might decide, well, that person really isn't qualified to be a supreme court justice even - -",
  "Except in the context of analyzing what State requirements have been?",
  "Aside - -",
  "Yes. The only cases - -",
  "The only cases that I would submit, that I'm aware of, that would answer that would be Equal Protection Clause cases, because the - - these -- the political party is a group of people that decide to form together because of common beliefs. In the -- that is the maximum freedom that we allow for associations. With all the business about smoke-filled rooms and things like that, people have the right to decide, make decisions - -",
  "Yes, Justice Kennedy. I -- I don't -- in an association - -",
  "Well, a party might - -",
  "A party would -- there's two questions there. If the party wants to have a 4-year requirement before you can be a part of that association, I can't understand what the First Amendment associational right would be.",
  "If the State imposed that, the party could say, well, that's unreasonable; we want to open -- in fact, the Court decided this by saying that the --- the party who wanted to could allow independents to vote. If I might, Mr. Chief Justice, may I reserve --",
  "Well, I'm not -- I think I tried to answer that the best I could by saying that I think the import of the cases, without getting into the specifics of that, are that if you have a reasonable access by individuals or political parties to the electoral process, that satisfies the Constitution.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The Second Circuit reinstalled what the New York Legislature found to be a bad system, that it discouraged qualified candidates and it encouraged this unfortunate, unseemly race for money. The Respondents just said that that is not what they were interested in doing, but their prayer for their relief, on page 35 of their complaint, calls for a direct primary election for the Supreme Court. With respect to the Kusper case, Justice Kennedy, I gave that a little bit more thought. That -- that case focused on the fact that the statute was inhibiting the rights of an individual who wanted to participate in a way that the party wanted that individual to participate. That long period of time prevented both the individual and the association from associating together, which is why - -",
  "Yes. But -- and to the extent that it was -- it was -- part of that is answered by your Clingman case which just came relatively recently, where the party wanted independents to vote in the primary and the Supreme Court -- this Court said that the State had to let that happen. With respect to time periods between when you had to identify yourself as a party member this court held in the Rosario case that a certain length of time is appropriate under the system. With respect to Mr. Dunne, we've heard about him. He may have had a desire to be a delegate but he never tried to get the 500 signatures. It says that right on his -- on page 19 of his brief -- the brief that my colleague was quoting. With respect to the questions that I think both Justice Stevens and Justice Souter were asking, could the State lodge the candidate selection or the delegate selection process in the party leaders, I can't conceive of how that would be unconstitutional. If the parties wanted to select the delegates or select the candidates to be their standard bearers, that seems to me to be perfectly within the right of an association to do; and would be perfectly appropriate, provided that there was an access for independents and - -",
  "No. No.",
  "No. But I think those hypothetical questions are could the State vest that authority. Finally I think it's important to say -- oh, one more preliminary point. It is competitive in New York. It may not be perfectly competitive, as is the case of 90 percent of the congressional districts in this country, which are said not to be competitive. But in New York, six sitting judges testified in -- in -- in the lower court that they successfully lobbied delegates to, you know, to be candidates. So that happens. Between 1900 and 2002, this is appendix 130, nearly one fourth of the general elections in New York were competitive. Lopez Torres, the Respondent, received 25 votes at the 2002 judicial selection convention, and many of the districts in New York are not dominated by a single party. So the final point is it is important to emphasize this is a -- a challenge on its face to the statute that simply creates a delegate election and it then creates a convention. Neither of those provisions can possibly be constitutional, and so what the Respondents are complaining about is what party bosses do. But on page 38 of their brief, they state categorically that the constitutional offense is not the fact that party leaders act as one would expect in choosing nominees. In other words, they act -- party leaders act like party leaders and exercise their influence. They're not saying that that's unconstitutional. What they're saying is that a statute that allows party leaders to be party leaders, to be constitutional, to act in ways which are not only permissible under the Constitution as they knowledge, but constitutionally protected, is somehow constitutional. That simply is not consistent with any of this Court's jurisprudence, which says that political parties must have the maximum opportunity to select their leadership. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think that the key central focus of this case was touched upon by Justice Kennedy's question. Congress made a decision that it wanted to balance reasonable safety and effectiveness of lifesaving devices with the availability of lifesaving devices to the public. They did so by vesting this responsibility in the experts, the expertise, the judgment, and the processes at the FDA. And preemption of potentially conflicting, confusing, and burdensome State law requirements is essential to this scheme.",
  "They're similar, but they're also quite different, Justice Ginsburg. The principal difference is this preemption provision that is the fundamental issue in this case. Section 360k(a)(1), that similar provision was not put by Congress in the new drug - -",
  "If there was such a State pre-market approval process, it would be something like the Federal process which would involve a very detailed application which would have everything about the design, the manufacture, and the warning labels in it. Then California would come up with different requirements, presumably or potentially, than what the FDA had decided was a reasonable balance between safety and effectiveness and availability. And so therefore, there would be different requirements. And, as Justice Breyer pointed out in his concurring and dissenting opinion in the Lohr case, if a State jury or a State court comes up with those different requirements, it is the same problem: Different States, different requirements under different circumstances. And it would be quite anomalous for Congress to have given more power to juries in individual ad hoc cases which don't do the weighing, Justice Kennedy - - they can't do the same amount of weighing because their focus - -",
  "This is a continuous process. Information must be given by the manufacturer. There is a process by which doctors report consequences to the FDA. Citizens may report information. This is a continuous jurisdiction - -",
  "Yes - -",
  "Yes, Justice Kennedy. And let me explain why I think that is important to this case. If the -- that information is then in the possession of the FDA. The FDA can suggest to the manufacturer -- it can require the recall. It can change warnings. It can do all of those things. But what it is doing, because it's continuously involved in the process - -",
  "What I'm suggesting is that the FDA can act as promptly or as slowly - -",
  "It's dependent upon the manufacturer providing information to the one centralized agency - -",
  "Yes, Justice Stevens, because in that case - -",
  "Yes. And that's a judgment that Congress made, because with the -- the manufacturer then would be violating the law, failing to tell the FDA what was going on, perhaps comitting fraud, and be subject to criminal penalties, recall penalties, civil penalties, and that sort of thing. The choice is, Justice Stevens, in that situation -- is to allow the agency that has the expertise, that has spent 1200 hours or so on this particular device, according to your opinion in the Lohr case, to make a judgment with respect to whether this product should be on the market or not. Because as I - -",
  "Yes, it does.",
  "And the reason for that, Justice Souter, is that someone must make a judgment. That - - the information that the manufacturer may have learned may be -- have some aspect of the safety or effectiveness of the device, but it still might be the best product available. As the government points out in its brief, there are some devices that are used in situations where a child might die. There's a 50-percent mortality rate even with using the device. So there's got to be individual judgments with respect to variations of risk and safety and availability.",
  "Well, all -- no, I don't know the answer to that specifically, Justice Alito. But I do know -- and this is the application, itself, which is not, unfortunately, in the record, but is available through the FDA. It goes into elaborate detail with respect to the burst pressures. This device -- the label on this device -- and that is in the record at A-174 of the court of appeals appendix -- specifically says it shouldn't be inflated higher than a burst pressure or atmospheric risk pressure at 8 atmospheres. This one was inflated to 10 atmospheres, notwithstanding the label requirements. So what -- what I am saying is that the elaborate nature -- everything in the label has to be approved by the FDA. The safety indications, the precautions, the hazards, the counter - - counterindications, and that sort of thing, there's a professional judgment there. My colleague says that well, it's not the FDA's not imposing requirements, because this is a design submitted by the manufacturer. Of course, it's a design submitted by the manufacturer. That's how devices are made. But the FDA examines every little part of that design -- the way it's manufactured, the way it's labeled, the way it's marketed, the way it's going to be used. And it can say no, change that part of it, or have you considered this? It's a dialogue between the manufacturer and the FDA. And then when the FDA is satisfied that it's reasonably safe and effective -- and the word \"reasonable\" is important. Nothing is perfectly safe. You can make a car weigh a hundred tons, and it might be perfectly safe, but balances have to be made, the same with drug devices. So - -",
  "No, I don't think you can. What you can do, Justice Alito, is examine -- and Justice Breyer's example of the two-inch versus one-inch wire in the Lohr case is a good example. The FDA will have examined, and presumably done its job, with respect to every aspect of the design, manufacture, and labeling and marketing of the device. Now, the choice is between that -- and I think Congress made this judgment quite consciously, because if a -- if a jury comes along in a particular case, examining a particular infant or a particular ill person and the facts of a particular situation, and says well, the device should have had a one-inch nail -- a wire, or it should have had a different tensile strength of the balloon, or something like that, then the manufacturer is in this dilemma.",
  "I think if there's a violation of the requirements -- now, it's no -- there's no question that there are requirements, because every aspect of this approval incorporates the design and all of those things. If the manufacturer fails to comply with those requirements, that's a parallel suit that may be brought. Now, in this case, the negligent manufacturer -- a claim was made. It was dismissed on summary judgment, which was affirmed by the Second Circuit because there was no evidence to support it. So --",
  "That was -- we agree that was not preempted, and -- and the court of appeals came to that same conclusion, but affirmed the district court that dismissed it on summary judgment because there was no evidence to support it.",
  "That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. Now our -- the statute, I think, could not be more clear with respect to every aspect of what the Court talked about in the Lohr case. And I think that the analysis that this Court articulated in the Geier case having to do with the air bags, although that was an implied preemption and conflict preemption case and this is an express preemption case, is very illustrative. The Court went through an analysis of what manufacturers might do if they were required to put an air bag in the car when the Department of Transportation had decided that it wanted a little bit of play in the marketplace with respect to different types of restraints of individuals. And the Court made it very clear that if a trial court in Kansas or some other place decides that cars must be manufactured in a certain way, that's what would happen. And then the judgment of the Department of Transportation, which was considering all of these things and wanting to encourage innovation with respect to restraints -- the same thing is true here. We want in this country for devices to be as safe and effective as they possibly can be. But we don't want to discourage the marketing of products that might save our lives. And these are -- Class 3 devices are all in the category of life-threatening or life-saving devices here. So we want those available. They may not all be perfect. They may work in some situations and not work in other situations, but some expert, centralized, that can take into consideration all of those factors should be the place where that decision is made.",
  "Well, I think the real world answers that question. The manufacturers of these products are always trying to produce better products that will be safer. They of course have to go through the process to justify to the experts at the FDA that they are indeed safe, or -- and the FDA then may make a judgment that the reasonableness -- if there is a much safer device that doesn't have the risks of the previous device, they can -- they can withdraw the approval of the previous device. But the FDA may at the same time say well, this one device might be safer under some circumstances but less safe under other circumstances. It might work in this critically ill patient, but not in this critically ill patient. So the marketplace of doctors and patients deserves to have more than one product out there, even though someone might decide this one is safer than the other one. That is the way Congress made this judgment. And - -",
  "I don't think so, Justice Kennedy. I think that there may be marketplace incentives and other things that would cause a - - someone in the marketplace to say I found a better way. Someone in the marketplace might say well, it might be better, but it might be prohibitively expensive. There are all kinds of those judgments, and I think that illustrates the point. The FDA is the right place for these decisions to be made and this balancing process to occur, because an individual ad hoc -- not scientifically trained jury that is not required to consider the consequences for the marketplace as a whole, cannot make those judgments. As conscientious as a jury might be, that judgment is in for that case and for that patient and might say well gee, it should have been done differently in this particular situation; a one-inch wire might have been better in this particular case. But the - -",
  "Yes. I believe that's true, but I think that was a slightly different point than Justice Kennedy's one; what was -- if it is the same point, I agree with you, that there is an elaborate process of information exchange from the manufacturer and from doctors and from all over with respect to these medical devices. It's described in considerable detail in about six pages in the court of appeals decision, and the Government's brief describes it quite thoroughly as well. That same balancing, the Government filed a brief last week in this Court in the Warner Lambert case, that this Court will be hearing, I think in January, which describes in even greater detail than it does in the brief filed here about that balancing process and the importance of the centralized - -",
  "That -- what the Chief Justice was referring to was an annual requirement - -",
  "-- but there also are requirements -- and I haven't -- can't give you the exact citation, there's a lot of subparagraphs in these sections -- with respect to information that comes into the possession of the manufacturer that's pertinent to adverse consequences or effects of the device that must be given promptly to the FDA.",
  "Well, I don't agree with that, Justice Scalia. In the first place, I don't think we know. Secondly, there are six of the seven circuits that have considered this case, found that those tort suits were preempted. So to the degree to which they are out there, there is one circuit in which they might --",
  "Yes, it did, and it -- and it learned from experience -- the unique experience that you described the FDA having, in your opinion in the Lohr case, has been brought to bear in this case; and there's a reasoned explanation for the FDA's -- the Government's position today, as to why it took one position then -- there were some proposed regulations that are no longer on the table -- but there's a reasoned explanation by the agency that you said and quite correctly in my judgment had a unique experience, and unique capability of determining the effect of take -- State court suits on the process that it's involved in, and that's reflected in the Government's briefs that are filed in this case just earlier. The fact is that there are specific detailed requirements with respect to every aspect of the device that's approved by the FDA; and any jury, just like any regulatory body, Justice Breyer, will impose a different requirement. The fundamental that you asked about, what's the basis of this suit, there was some answer to it, but the fact is there's some effort to explain why, if it was designed according to the approval, by the FDA, that wasn't good enough. There was something wrong with that design that was approved. Something wrong with that label that was approved. And a jury at the end of the day will be expected then to render a different requirement by saying you are liable for damages because you did it the way the FDA approved. That is a State requirement which is a counterpart to the Federal requirement, and this -- and Congress made it explicitly clear that any requirement that is different or in addition to the Federal requirement is preempted if it has to do with safety or effectiveness of the device. And if juries require products to be changed, they will by definition be either less safe or less available than the FDA has determined is in the best interests of the public according to the responsibility vested in them by Congress. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The False Claims Act addresses and redresses fraud on the government, not on every recipient of government funds. The liability-imposing provisions of the False Claims Act refer ten times in a single sentence to a submission to the government, getting a claim paid or approved by the government, or defrauding the government. Liability is to the government and it's based upon the amount of damages that the government sustains. 20 years ago, construing an even broader statute, this Court unanimously determined that defrauding the government in any manner for any purpose does not include defrauding recipients of Federal funds. That's the Tanner case. The United States made the same arguments in the Tanner case in 1987 that it's making today in connection with the False Claims Act, and this Court unanimously decided that case that defrauding the government did not include defrauding grantees or recipients of Federal funds. There is no evidence in this case that false or fraudulent claims were submitted to the United States. Indeed, we don't know from the record what was submitted to the United States, when it was submitted to the United States, what it contained.",
  "The district court very carefully analyzed that evidence, as well as all the other evidence in the case, Justice Ginsburg, and found that an inference could not be drawn with respect to what had happened or when it happened because there is a time lag to drawing an inference from certificates of performance when you don't know when those certificates were made, when they were submitted to the government, what they said.",
  "The Navy, you mean in connection with the litigation or in connection - -",
  "The answer to your question as I understand it, Justice Ginsburg, is yes, the Navy had the right to test the equipment, look at the -- look at the specifications, examine the specifications, ask for corrections if they were unsatisfied, to test the products. The Navy had the right to do all of those things. And one -- fundamental to this case is we don't know whether they did, whether they were satisfied with the generators as ultimately delivered to them, whether there were corrections, if there were deficiencies or deviations from the specifications when they were first submitted to the shipyards, whether those were corrected, whether those deviations were immaterial. Because - -",
  "It's my understanding -- I'm not 100 percent sure of that, Justice Kennedy, but it's my understanding that the government did have the right to follow the process all the way through. There's no evidence that they did so.",
  "Well, I think it would depend upon what was in the books and whether there was - -",
  "It -- that might be, Justice Kennedy. Regarding the terms of the statute, whether you might interpret that as providing under (a)(2), providing a record or document to the government with the intention that the government pay or approve a claim, I think you'd have to examine the evidence in that context. What we don't have here, we don't know what was submitted to the government. What the lawyers representing the claimants in this case -- and this is from page 5a of the appendix to the cert petition, footnote 3. We -- this is what the -- when they were asked about this issue: We haven't shown you the ship yard's invoices to the United States and we're not going to show you those. Because they are totally irrelevant under the False Claims Act. Now, that could not be more wrong, it seems to us. You can't determine -- if there's going to be a fraud, a claim of fraud against the United States, you have to know what the United States received to see whether it's fraudulent, to see whether any deviation from the facts were material, whether the deviation from the specifications where maybe the product was better, maybe it deviated in an insubstantial way or an immaterial way, maybe the government had an opportunity to fix it. We don't know whether there was reliance by the government. We don't know whether there was a loss by the government. And we don't know, if there was a loss by the government, the quantification for the loss.",
  "No. The way the record -- the record is a little confusing with respect to that, Justice Breyer, but I think that one of the witnesses - - I don't know how he knew - -",
  "But one of the witnesses said, yes, the money that we received was money that came from the United States.",
  "Well, that's the definition of the word \"claim.\"",
  "There has to be a claim. But then section -- you're reading subsection (c).",
  "Subsection (a) provides the standard for liability. So you can have a claim, but you're not liable for a false claim unless it's submitted to the government, unless it's knowingly made to get a fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. I -- I'm looking at the statute - -",
  "No, I quoted from both (a)(1) and (a)(2). (A)(2) - -",
  "Well, it reads out the words \"by the government\" from that section, which is what the statute looked like until it was specifically amended.",

  "Well, I think a reasonable reading of the statute is -- and this is essentially what this Court unanimously decided 20 years ago in the Tanner case, that these cases about defrauding the government must involve something that causes the government to suffer a loss, some something that impacts the government. Even -- even the government today is making the same statement that there has to be a loss. What I'm saying with -- it's important, Justice Kennedy, that -- that if you are going to want to get something paid or approved by the government, you have to do something that gets it to the government in some fashion. And reading (a)(1) and (a)(2) and (a)(3) and the Tanner decision and the history of this statute from 1863 all suggest very strongly, I submit, the plain language of the statute is that it's -- involves fraud against the government. Now, you may submit something to a prime - - you may be a subcontractor that submits something to the prime contractor, and this very -- this case is a very good example of it, and this case is very much like the Tanner case. What did the prime contractor do with it? If it was false or deficient or out of specifications, the prime contractor had a right to say: Wait a minute, tighten those bolts up a little bit more, or we're going to deduct it, a little price from that, and we're going to tell the government that there's a deviation from the specifications.",
  "Well, that's just the point, Justice Ginsburg. We don't no one way or the other unless the evidence is submitted. We don't know what the government received, so we don't know whether the government was deceived. So, if I submit that it might well be in this case -- we don't know how much time elapsed between the submission of the invoices or the other materials from the subcontractor to the prime contractor. What happened then between then and when the ships were delivered to the Navy? Lot of things could have happened. We don't know.",

  "That's -- that's correct, Justice Ginsburg. And that's my point. If you can't -- if you don't know what went to the government, you don't know whether a claim or a document or a statement, to use the words of the statute, went to the government, you don't know whether what the government got was false; you don't know whether they - -",

  "What the statute says - -",
  "What the statute says is that it is liability to the government for the damage the government sustains. Now, it may well be -- there's penalties even if there isn't damage to the government. I would concede that.",
  "Well, you could say that, but you don't know whether the government got what it wanted. You don't know whether the -- if something deviates from specifications in a contract, it might deviate on the plus side of something, it might deviate in an immaterial way. The contractor, the prime shipyards here, and the government had the right to correct any deficiencies.",
  "Well, what you've done with your question, Justice Scalia, is left out the link. What happened -- what -- the government may have made -- given money to the schools. Subcontractors might have submitted something false. The prime contractor might have discovered it and said: Correct this or - -",
  "No, it isn't - -",
  "Well, it -- it might under some circumstances be harm. It might not under other circumstances be harm. It might be misleading in an immaterial way. It might -- there might have been no reliance by the government. There might have -- the government might have said -- the contract between the prime contractor and the subcontractor might have different requirements than what the government wants. None of those - -",
  "The Federal Government may have been injured. The question is what does this statute redress? There are other statutes. There's a major fraud provision of Title 18 that has major penalties for fraud by subcontractors against contractors in connection with public projects just as the one -- like the ones you're describing. But if this Court's Tanner decision is correct -- and it was only 20 years ago; it was unanimous -- it defined the term \"defrauding the government\" and it said \"defrauding the government\" means defrauding the government, not filing a false claim - -",
  "It has to be a false claim paid by the government.",
  "What -- Justice Breyer, what is missing from your hypothetical is what went to the government. Suppose the prime contractor decided that the paint was off-white instead of white, and that was satisfactory. Suppose the subcontractor said to the government: This is a major project; this is a billion-dollar project; there are all these little things that are out of specifications and could be called false or fraudulent or misleading; we're going to disclose all of these things to the government. The government has a complete opportunity to test them, look at them, and decide whether it's satisfied. Then the government isn't deceived.",
  "Well, I think you are taking the words and isolating them.",
  "It is knowingly making a false record or a false statement to get a false claim paid. If the government didn't pay a false claim, then (a)(2) doesn't provide for liability.",
  "Yes, I should have said - -",
  "Well, if -- I should have said the word \"approved\" because I -- I was shortening it up. But it does say \"paid or approved.\" But what has to be done is that the government has to -- what has to be submitted is something to cause the government to pay or to approve a false claim to the government.",
  "Well, what I might say in addition to what I have said, Justice Souter, is that there is no stopping point for that theory. The government says as long as the project involved Federal money, as long as the project used Federal funds, as long as the project might endanger the Federal fisc, as long as the program is financed in part by Federal money, there would be liability under this statute. Given the tens of thousands of government contracts, government funds, government financing of States, localities, universities, and so forth, there is no limiting point. And what - -",
  "I don't -- I don't think, with respect, that that's a fair reading of what the government said either in the Tanner case, think making essentially the same arguments which were rejected unanimously by this Court, or what it says in its brief to the Court today.",
  "In -- with respect to that, the government filed a brief in a case called Atkins versus McInteer in the Eleventh circuit, and I have the brief here -- it is not part of the material that is before you -- in which the government said that even if the District -- D.C. Circuit decision that's involved in this case, the Totten case, was correctly decided, those Medicare-Medicaid cases would be substantially covered under the statute even under that construction because the provider's claim is passed on by the insurer to the Medicare agency or entity. Now, I don't know, Justice Ginsburg, the facts of that case or the facts of all of those circumstances. But the fact is that if you take this statute as it was enacted in 1863, all of this used to be a part of one section that talked in the first case, the first instance, one sentence which discussed in the first instance a presentation of a claim to the government and which was the liability to be imposed upon the claimant. The second part of the sentence said -- it was intended to cover the people aiding the fraud, those people that provided with records or statements in order to get the payment made. And then the third provision was the conspiracy provision. Those were broken out into the subsections you see today. In 1982, Congress specifically said: We are simply codifying the statute; we're not changing the statute. We are making no substantive changes in the statute. If you read that provision in the context of the Marcus versus Hess case, which was in the early '40s, in which the government -- in which the Court specifically said there's liability for an intermediary causing a -- Federal Government to pay the claim.

  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me address the -- what seems to be a controversy as to what was submitted to the Navy. In the first place, the invoices were not submitted to the Navy. We know that. That's the provision that I quoted before. The Plaintiffs in this case did not call a single Navy witness. They did not call the prime contractor as a witness. So we don't know what the Navy received, or what the Navy did not receive. With respect to the so-called certification, that is addressed on pages 57a through 59a of the cert petition appendix. This is a district court decision, three pages of discussion. This was an argument that the relators came up with relatively late when they couldn't explain why they didn't have the invoices or what actually went to the Navy, and they argued that Bath submitted a false implied certification. Then the district court goes through the evidence on pages 57a to 59a and concludes at the top of 59a there is no evidence of a requiring -- of a required, continuing certification with respect to quality, which is the issue tried in this case. I don't have time to go through all of that or all of the evidence, but that is backing and filling. There -- and the question presented is a correct question presented. As the relators put it to the -- to the district court, we don't have to do that. We are not going to show you - -",
  "If it was -- if the qualification -- if a -- if a - -",
  "I -- they -- there has to be - - no. Under (a)(2), Justice Stevens, you could submit a statement intending to get a false claim approved or paid by the government. Now, the government can't approve anything if it's not actually submitted to it, or not intended to be submitted to it. That's in the same section of -- of the statute. Let me -- let me turn to the -- this is a penal statute. There is a punitive statute, as you pointed out, in the Vermont versus Stevens case. There is no meaningful limitation on what the government and the Respondents want in this case. The government has now come up with this limitation: Well, it must be really a government project. Well, that isn't in the statute. That's basically the same thing you unanimously rejected in the Tanner case. The government said in its brief if the government is the ultimate source of the funds. That goes back to the example that the Chief Justice was making. There might be 15 different layers, the way this government works. Money is fungible. It's impossible to trace. This statute is intended to address claims made, or statements made in connection with claims made, to -- to commit to defraud the government, and defraud the government irrespective of the definition of \"claim,\" which could have been put in section (a), but was not put in section (a), the liability section. The Congress knows how to put those words in statutes. They were in the major fraud statute, the - - the case that this Court distinguished in Dixon, in - - in Tanner. The Dixon case was money given -- paid to or on behalf of the government. There is language like that throughout the congressional statutes. We don't know in this case whether the government was defrauded, or was intended to be defrauded, because there is this big space between what went on between the subcontractors and the shipbuilders and what went on between the shipbuilders and the government. There could have been all kinds of dialogue. There could have been disclosures. There might be deviations from the specifications in any kind of government contract. But this statute has to have a limitation point. And if you look at it from 1863 up to the present, it is intended just as the Tanner case said. And in Marcus versus Hess you said that the criminal false claim statutes have to be construed identically with the civil false claims provisions if they contain identical language. 371 has the same language as the False Claims Act's, and the Tanner case is dispositive.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondents' state law claims track nearly verbatim the Cigarette Labeling Act's pre-emption provision. For example, the complaint challenges promotions of light cigarettes as less harmful and safer to smokers than regular cigarettes. But the statute, Congress, explicitly preempted any requirement respecting the promotion of cigarettes based upon smoking and health. In short, the Respondents are seeking in state court precisely what Congress pre-empted. There is no space - -",
  "Well, I think the facts could differ from case to case, Mr. Chief Justice. But the inquiry is going to be generally, I think, simple: Is there a requirement? Is it based upon smoking and health, and does it appear in an advertising or promotion of a cigarette. Now, I suppose there might be conceivably circumstances where it's impossible to tell that the requirement is not connected in some way with smoking and health, but it's certainly clear here. The complaint specifically talks in terms of promoting cigarettes, purporting to be less harmful or safer, despite serious health problems associated with smoking. These appear at the beginning in paragraph 2 of the amended complaint which is at pages, beginning Joint Appendix pages 26 through 28. I invite the Court's attention to paragraph 2 of the amended complaint and paragraphs 15 and 18 of the amended complaint. In fact, the words \"promotion,\" \"cigarettes,\" \"smoking,\" \"safety,\" and \"health,\" the very words that appear in the Labeling Act statute, appear, I counted at least 12 times in the amended complaint.",
  "I think that there is. In answer to the general question that you ask, Justice Gins burg, there is plenty of room for an attorney general to pursue deceptive advertising. Another example -- and I'll come to the one you mentioned -- is that someone might misrepresent the number of cigarettes in a package or other things having to do with cigarettes. That would not necessarily be related to smoking and health. So there is not a pre-emption if there is not a relationship between the prohibition and smoking and health. The example you gave might require some sort of inquiry as to what is motivating the attorney general. The motivation is what you referred to, your Court referred to in the Reilly case and I would say - -",
  "I think that's probably true in most cases, Justice Souter, that the reason why there might be regulations at the State level having to do with cigarettes and advertising by and large is going to have to do with smoking and health. The Court went through the same inquiry in the Reilly case where it had to do with billboards and - -",
  "If -- if the courts were to conclude that it had a relationship with smoking and health, the answer is yes, Justice Ginsburg, but there might be some case in which someone said, well, the issue about nicotine and content of nicotine is being regulated because it doesn't have anything to do with smoking and health, but in the environment in which this -- this statute was passed and this litigation was pursued, there certainly isn't any question here. Now, I think Justice Stevens, even in his dissenting opinion in the Reilly case, focused on the content. He said and the -- your dissenting opinion in that case said, as opposed to location, that the Labeling Act was focusing on the content of advertising.",
  "No, Justice Kennedy, to the - - the Federal Trade Commission, by the way, has full authority to regulate deceptive - -",
  "Well, there could be -- the States may regulate the sale of items. The Labeling Act provision only relates to promotion, marketing, advertising, and that sort of thing. The State can prohibit the sale of cigarettes. States and municipalities have done that sort of thing. This statute has three provisions in it: Is what the State is attempting to do a requirement or prohibition. There's no question that that's involved here. Does it have to do with the advertising or promotion of cigarettes? There's no question that this complaint is aimed at the advertising and promotion of cigarettes. And does the advertising or promotion have to do with smoking and health?",
  "I don't - -",
  "I don't mean to be whimsical, but I think that, to the extent there's a representation with respect to growing hair or something like that, that may not -- it probably isn't -- have to do with smoking and health.",
  "Yes. And let me say with respect to the Cipollone plurality opinion, which was found to be baffling, confusing, litigation- generating, easily abated by the labeling of the complaint, and superseded by a number of subsequent decisions by this Court, it should be set aside and restated. However, the very case that the Cipollone decision in the plurality did decide was pre-empted even under that plurality opinion, and this is at page 527 of the opinion, is an advertising that purported to neutralize, minimize, down-play, negate, or disclaim the warning label on the packages. This complaint is precisely that claim. You could probably not have written a claim more squarely - -",
  "That is the argument, and the Respondents are making that argument. I submit that that argument is squarely answered by the text of the statute, which this Court has said again and again you have to turn to. The text of the statute says no requirement or prohibition; it doesn't say no requirement or prohibition except one which is expressly misleading. And the reason you mentioned, Justice Breyer, what was the background for the statute or what was Congress intending to do, well, fortunately on section 1331 of the Labeling Act, which is on 1A of the blue brief, Congress declares its policy and purpose squarely, unequivocally, and in what this Court said in Reilly was sweeping language: Any relationship between smoking and health. And then Congress went on to point out that with the labeling requirements, it intended for consumers to receive certain information about the smoking of cigarettes with specific labels, and then went on to say, without hurting the commerce and the national economy to be protected from confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations that might be \"non-uniform, confusing, or diverse.\" Now, Justice Stevens again in the Reilly opinion when he was distinguishing in his concurring opinion -- I can't recall whether it's a concurring or dissenting opinion -- focused on the fact that different requirements by different States might cause those very diverse, confusing advertising. If one State says, you've got to put something else in there about this; one State says that so-called descriptors are misleading, as was the case under this case, and another State says, like Illinois said in another case, that they are not misleading; that national advertising becomes impossible. That's inconsistent and Congress expressed what its policy was. And, Justice Breyer, the Court went through the same process in the Morales case and the Wolens case in connection with airline and deregulation and whether or not misleading advertising might be expressly pre-empted. The Court went through the same sort of process in the Riegel case with respect to medical devices. The Court went through the same process in the Rowe case, decided on the same day as Riegel in connection with another context. And again, with respect to the Reilly case, the Court - -",
  "Yes, Justice Stevens. Not just 1334(b) but 1331, which it helps explain.",
  "I think it is, unless I misunderstood your question. If a State decides what may be in the advertising or promotion - -",
  "Well, the statute contains the words both \"requirement\" and \"prohibition.\" And in your plurality opinion in Cipollone on page 527, the same page I mentioned before, you made the point that a prohibition is merely the converse of a requirement. And either a prohibition or a requirement with respect to advertising if it relates to smoking and health is pre-empted.",
  "Yes. And to the extent -- no, we are not saying that the Massachusetts unfair - practices statute is preempted in all respects. It's only when the statute, like a common law tort provision which the Court considered in Riegel, has application to the context of smoking and health. If the Court starts with the Morales case through the Wolens case, through the Bates case, through the Riegel case, through the Reilly case, it's the application of the statute in the Reilly case. It was a -- it was a statute of Massachusetts very much identical, virtually identical, to the Maine statute here. And in the -- in the Reilly case the attorney general was attempting to apply the generalized, unfair-practice statute to the advertising of smoking and cigarettes near schools. This is a similar statute, which is attempted to be applied in the context of these labels and the advertising of cigarettes. It's the application of a generalized statute. This Court repeatedly said, and specifically said in the Riegel case, there is hardly any common law requirements which are requirements, the Court has repeatedly held -- and the Respondents don't dispute that; they specifically acknowledge it -- when it's the application of a general standard to the circumstances of the case. That's where the pre-emption occurs. Congress didn't want to pre-empt general common law standards about fraud or misrepresentation or anything like that except in the context of the marketing - -",
  "Well, the Court -- and this Court recently in Aetna v. Davila specifically said that pre-emption can't be decided based upon the label that the plaintiff puts in the complaint. Now, as I think every member of this Court would know, a creative plaintiff's lawyer can call a claim misrepresentation, willful misrepresentation, concealment, failure to warn, and so on and so forth. It's just a matter of how they change the label on the complaint. Now, what Congress didn't want -- and I just gave an example of a situation where Illinois decided that the descriptors, which are an issue in this case were not misleading; and it was not -- and they could continue to be used. What happened in this case in applying the Maine statute is a court decided that they were misleading and -- and couldn't be used.",
  "That's correct, and I'm not saying - -",
  "I -- I haven't got all of the specifics of that case; but what I felt -- I just simply meant -- but I think it's an example of what you said in your concurring opinion in Reilly: That if you're going to conduct a national advertising campaign, it can't be governed by what a jury might decide in Des Moines versus what a jury might decide in Birmingham, Alabama. And - -",
  "Well, no, that's absolutely - - absolutely correct, Justice Ginsburg. In fact, the panoply of this Court's decisions say that it doesn't matter whether it's a statute -- a generalized statute that's being applied or a common law standard that's being applied, and it does not matter whether it's an attorney general interpreting and enforcing general provisions -- I give you Morales and the Wolens situation -- or it's whether it's a common law tort action being brought by a plaintiff to submit a case to a jury a la Riegel.",
  "Well, there is also -- I -- I think it doesn't -- it's not dispositive of the pre-emption case, but there's also the master settlement agreement that the tobacco companies entered into with the States, which gives the States a lot of power to enforce various different things. But I think that the point here is that, yes, Congress decided that it wanted one uniform source of regulation of advertising of cigarettes with respect to smoking and health. Now - -",
  "The master settlement agreement?",
  "I -- I don't -- I can't answer that question. I don't know the answer to that question, but what I -- I believe that it would allow broad powers by the attorney generals. But I have - - hasten to say, as I did at the beginning, because some parties entered into that master settlement agreement I don't think changes the Federal -- the congressional intent is very clear. It wanted the -- the statement -- Congress wanted the statements, certain statements, on cigarette packages. It didn't want any confusion about what the marketing or promotion of cigarettes would be. I can't imagine, Justice Ginsburg, a clearer statement. It says no requirement or prohibition in section 1334(b). And in 1331 it says \"comprehensive Federal programs that deal with cigarette labeling and advertising with respect to any relationship between smoking and health.\"",
  "Well, the point - -",
  "Well, the -- the statute deals with this to a degree in section 1336 by saving certain responsibilities. But I think the more powerful answer is that the background principle, the Federal Trade Commission Act and Federal and State Trade -- Fair Practices Act, are a part of a national scheme just exactly as you said. It's a background - -",
  "Well, no. As a matter of fact, I could not disagree more, Justice Souter. That's the general background scheme. Then Congress specifically addresses smoking and health in the advertising of cigarettes. The same - -",
  "Well, it -- we have -- I'd like to spend no time on the implied preemption argument - -",
  "-- because I think -- I think this is the -- the -- that Congress could not have been more clear. And another answer to your question, Justice Souter, is the Airline Deregulation Act. You dealt -- you Court dealt with this in the Morales case and the Wolens case. The -- you could have said the same thing there: That there is a background principle against unfair - -",
  "I don't -- I think that it's clear that, looking at the briefs in that case, that those very same arguments were made. The same argument could have been made in the Riegel case with respect to devices. The general principle that I'm making that I think Congress understands, and this Court has clearly understood, is that there is a background principle that the Federal Government is not pre-empting deceptive practice regulations except when Congress specifically says so. Now, one more point because I think the white light will come on: the United States Government did not address in this case the express pre-emption argument. But a few years ago, in the Reilly case, having to do with the very same statute, the Cigarette Labeling Act, the United States Government said that the labeling act pre-empted State laws concerning the content of cigarette advertising, the content of cigarette advertising. That's what the government said then and the Acting Solicitor General during the argument in that case, in response to a question by one of your members of this Court, specifically said the - - the statute would pre-empt State laws about filters or the safety of a particular cigarette. That was the position of the United States Government a couple of years ago and they have not changed. Mr. Chief Justice, if I may reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. We haven't given up the implied pre-emption argument, but I - -",
  "I -- we feel that we explained it very thoroughly in our briefs, and I thought knowing that the time was limited I thought we should focus on the strongest argument I think by any stretch of the imagination, when Congress has spoken directly. Now, first of all, with respect to what the Solicitor General on behalf of the United States says, and this is in response to the point that Justice Scalia was just addressing -- page 1 of the Reilly brief, the Attorney General is responsible for enforcing the Labeling Act. So it is the government's responsibility, according to them, to enforce the Labeling Act. Then on pages 8 and 9 of their brief, distinguishing between the location of the billboards in that case and other things that would be pre-empted, pages 8 and 9, the Government said the Labeling Act preempts State laws concerning the content of cigarette advertising with respect to smoking and health. And the Acting Solicitor General on page 25 of the transcript of the argument that day in this case was asked that question, what is pre-empted? And she said it pre-empts State law claims about filters or the safety of a particular cigarette. That is this case.",
  "That was the government's point.",
  "It has to do according to what Congress said about the content of the advertising and the promotion of cigarettes; that's what this case is about when it has to do with smoking and health. Now, my opponent seems to run away, in answer to your question, about what if we take out smoking and health from their complaint? Well, they can't take out smoking. That is everywhere in the complaint. I asked the Court to sit down and compare the labeling statute with the complaint. And the words are indistinguishable, and they say over and over again and on page 4A of -- then Mr. Frederick's saying well, all they want is economic damages. They are really not -- they are just concerned about they got one cigarette and they wanted to get another cigarette. Page 4A, this is the way the Court of Appeals understood it. This is page 4A of the petition appendix: the plaintiffs explain that the relative levels of these substances bear on a reasonable consumer's decision on which cigarette to purchase, because consumers understand that reducing the quantities of tar and nicotine in cigarettes reduces their adverse health effects. That is what this case is all about. Now, I will just conclude in this way. The statute in the language of this Court in the Reilly case, uses \"sweeping language.\" The language is every bit as sweeping as the language in the airline deregulation act that uses the phrase relates to, I submit. So there is three requirements. Either - - the statute prohibits, any and it uses the phrase \"any,\" you can't get more expansive than that; and it uses the word \"no\" requirements or prohibition. The Court has dealt with requirements and prohibition in Reilly, Cipollone, Bates, Wolens, Riegel. The statute that we are talking about here in this case is the same statute essentially that it was dealing with in Reilly. It's the State Unfair Practices Act. It was Massachusetts/Maine; but I compared the statutes side by side. They essentially the same. Is the requirement based upon smoking and health? Well, the complaint specifically says so. The relief is based upon the relationship between smoking and health and is it in promotion or advertising of tobacco? Again, they've said that over and over again. I submit that the statute could not be more clear. This particular complaint seeks to impose a regulation - -",
  "Yes. I believe it does. However, Justice Stevens, I believe when you talked about in that -- the plurality opinion, you talked about minimizing, reducing, negating the effect of the warning labels. That's also this complaint. This as a complaint is identical so what you were referring to on page 527 of Cipollone.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress squarely addressed and unambiguously answered the first question in this case when it enacted the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. It authorized the Secretary to take land in trust for Indians, and it declared, as used in this Act, Indians were \"members of any recognized Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction.\" The word \"now\" had the same meaning in 1934 as it does every morning in this Court when the Marshal announces that \"The Court is now sitting.\" When Congress said \"now under Federal jurisdiction,\" it did not mean \"then under Federal jurisdiction,\" but that is what the Government contends. In fact, the word \"then\" is the antonym for \"now.\" \"Now\" must be given its ordinary meaning, which the Government concedes on -- in its brief, is the date, effective date of the statute. In this statute, the term \"now\" and synonyms are used repeatedly throughout the Indian Reorganization Act. The word \"now\" appears five times in the same sense throughout the Act. The word \"hereafter\" is also used. The word -- the term \"now\" or \"hereafter\" is used three times; \"heretofore\" is used three times. I mention these things because the Congress that read and enacted the statute had a keen sense of the temporal nature of the terms used in the Act.",
  "Pardon me, Justice Breyer? I didn't hear you.",
  "Well, it is - -",
  "Of course, of course, Justice Breyer. There are many contexts in which one could conceivably, but the context would tell you. In fact, the Government's -- one of the Government's examples is the use of the word \"now\" in a will. Of course, everyone knows the will speaks as of the date of the passage of the individual. There's another reference in the statute where the Government refers to that, and the statute itself has a very clear, different meaning. My reference to the statute and the use of the word \"now\" in this statute is very, very clear. The legislation -- the statute refers to legislation \"now pending.\" That had to mean 1934. It refers to boundaries \"now existing or hereafter established.\" It refers to positions and Indian tribes \"now or hereafter created.\" It refers to lawsuits \"now pending or hereafter filed.\" It refers to tribes \"now under Federal jurisdiction.\" All of those uses of the word \"now\" are consistent. If the Government was correct, the word \"now\" would have no meaning in that statute. I think it was interesting, if one takes the question presented as articulated by the Government, it says, \"Whether the Indian Reorganization Act authorizes the Interior Secretary to take into trust on behalf of an Indian tribe that was not recognized\" -- \"a not recognized Indian tribe under Federal jurisdiction on June 18th, 1934,\" if you take that word \"not\" and strike it out of the question presented, you get the statute. So, what the Government is asking for is the exact opposite of what the statute clearly requires. And all one has to do is look at the question presenting -- presented as - -",
  "But it says, Chief Justice Roberts, it says \"Indian tribe.\" And the word \"Indian,\" in that very section, at the very beginning of the section, says \"the term 'Indian' as used in this Act,\" blah, blah, blah. So then, later in that same section, it refers to \"Indian tribe.\" It's important to juxtapose section 5, which is codified as 465, and section 19, which is codified as 479, to look at the statute. The first part of section 5 authorizes the Secretary to take land for Indians. Now, the way the Government addresses that in the Government's brief, they took the word \"tribe\" at the - - towards the end of Section 465 and said the statute authorizes taking land for tribes. It actually says taking land for Indians, and then in the latter part of section 5, it says \"title\" -- \"When property is taken for Indians, title may be vested in an individual Indian or in a tribe.\" Then when you get to section 19, Congress very carefully said, \"As used in this Act, the term 'Indian' shall mean\" what we've been talking about here today, and that's an adjective that describes \"tribe\" later in the sentence. There's two things that the Government does in their brief which I find very interesting. First of all, the Government says the use of the word \"Indian\" doesn't necessarily mean Indians. But Title I, section 1, of the United States Code, the first sentence in the United States Code, says: \"The word 'singular'\" -- \"The word 'singular' shall include the plural, and the plural shall include the word 'singular.'\" So the United States is disregarding that maxim. Of course, the context can always indicate something different. But the Government asks you to ignore the singular or plural. And then the other thing that the Government does is to ask you to understand that the word \"Indian\" means something when it's a noun and something else when it's an adjective, violating another primary construct -- construction, statutory construction.",
  "The -- the -- yes. I understand that, Justice Alito, and -- and no statute, if you -- if you come along 70 years later, is it not possible to find something like that. But the fact is that the only consistent way to look at that term throughout the statute -- and I would say, first of all, it's the language of the statute. It's the context of the words in the statute where the word \"Indian\" has to mean certain things. It has to have some limitation. Otherwise, the Secretary can do anything, and -- and Congress certainly didn't intend that. It's not just the text of the statute. It's the purpose for the statute, which was to protect and remediate Indians and Indian tribes that have been harmed by the allotment policy.",
  "Well, the use of the word \"tribe\" in that question is -- is causing me a problem momentarily.",
  "Well, there were all sorts of Indians who were not under Federal jurisdiction. What -- there is a -- there is a document that the Government produced in 19 -- in just this summer. There are four documents I urge the Court to look at that the Government suddenly discovered after 10 years of litigation and produced in August of this summer, all of which are Interior Department documents which support our position in this case, Justice Kennedy. What -- the fact is that there were many Indians throughout the United States that were not recognized -- recognized as a part of tribes. They weren't groups of individuals with whom the United States had made treaties. The United States had various different relationships with groups of Indians, including tribes.",
  "Yes. And - -",
  "Yes. In fact, many -- many of the Indians throughout the United States were not connected or -- or tied up into a formal tribe. The purpose for the Indian Allotment Act was to take a - - land out of reservations and out of the possession of Indian tribes and distribute that to -- to Indians in fee simple so that they could sell it to someone else. Congress decided, the United States decided, in the '30s that that policy had been -- ill-served the Indians and ill-served the United States. So the Indian Reorganization Act was intended to address and remediate that. At the same time the United States was concerned and the Congress was concerned that there had to be some limit. If there were Indians that had not been adversely affected by the Allotment Act, they were not intended to be, generally speaking, covered by the Indian Reorganization Act. So what I mean -- I was saying in response to Justice Alito's question -- it's not just the text of the statute. It's the purpose for the statute, which was to provide some benefits and some limitations on the damage done by the allotment policy. So it was natural, when it was necessary to come up with some restriction on who would be the potential beneficiaries of the statute, to look at the tribes that were under Federal jurisdiction in 1934 who had been harmed in some fashion.",
  "Well, what the Interior Department did was, in compliance with the statute - - was to set about and create a list. There was a list created in 1936, as I understand it, Chief Justice Roberts. There was subsequent legislation that has even a List Act. But the -- what - -",
  "Well, there was a relatively sharp distinction. That is to say, it was Indians that had treaties with the United States, or tribes that had treaties with the United States, or had been recognized in some fashion by the United States Government in terms of a relationship between the Government of the United States and the Indian tribes. Now, the Federal Register and Federal records in 1934 were not what they are today, and that's the reason why, when these words were used, the Interior Department set about to look through the history of the Interior Department and to come up with a list of tribes that would have been covered, would have been embraced, by that term now recognized in 1934.",
  "Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg. In fact, to the extent that it's necessary to go back and -- and it happened on a few occasions subsequent to 1934 that historical records were reviewed, relationships between the tribe and the Federal Government were reviewed. In fact, in the Government's brief, the Government talks about three tribes for which land was taken into trust that didn't fit the definition of now recognized -- tribes recognized in 1934. We went back and looked at two of those three tribes where -- in fact did have treaties with the United States and would have been included. The other would have probably been included and could be included just exactly the way you suggested in your question. The other point that I think is very important to emphasize is that 15 times since the enactment of this statute Congress has acted specifically to apply the Indian Reorganization Act to an Indian tribe that had not been covered in 1934, evidencing some congressional understanding that it - - it took an act of Congress to bring a particular tribe under the Act. There is these - -",
  "Well, what -- what -- I think I understand your question. What the Government wants to do is just take the word \"now\" out of the statute altogether.",
  "The only way the statute makes sense is to construe \"now\" to mean 19 - -",
  "Chief Justice Roberts, what - - it was intended -- members of Congress had to think the word \"now\" meant something. In fact, there is a colloquy between Senator Wheeler and Commissioner -- Bureau of Indian Affairs Commissioner Collier that is referred to in the briefs where Senator Wheeler was saying: Well, there are some -- some groups out in - - in California that are no more Indian than you or I. What are we going to do about that? And Commissioner Collier, who is the author of the Act, says: We will stick the words \"now under Federal jurisdiction in there.\" And then he explains exactly what was meant by that: That would -- that it would cover tribes that existed in -- in 19 -- that would -- he says that would limit the Act to Indians now -- and he is speaking at the time the statute was being debated -- under Federal jurisdiction. Those documents that the Government suddenly discovered in August of this year, which were lodged with this Court in the latter part of August of this year, include a 1936 -- circular letter by Commissioner Collier to all of the superintendents throughout the United States. This is the author of the statute speaking in 1936, and he says \"all persons of Indian descent who are members of any recognized tribe that was under Federal jurisdiction at the date of the Act.\" Now your point, Chief Justice Roberts, is that maybe it was unclear at the exact moment of -- of enactment which 198, or whatever number it might have been, tribes were under that, but that's the sort of information that can be discerned by looking at the history and the records so that a finite group could be identified. It isn't perfect, as Justice Ginsburg's question suggests, but it is a verifiable method of limiting what Congress obviously intended to limit - -",
  "No. Not in -- it says \"Indian tribe\" - -",
  "It refers, in the second-to-last sentence of section 19 or 479, \"The term 'tribe' wherever used in this Act shall be construed to refer to any Indian tribe.\" That's -- that - -",
  "Well, the word \"Indian\" is, if you accept the word - -",
  "Well, that just simply, I submit, defines the word \"adult.\"",
  "We were reading from section 479, which is at page 15a of the Carcieri brief.",
  "Yes. Yes. Now, the Government, I think, has the codified version of it as well as there are some changes - -",
  "Well, I'm happy to do it either way. The -- the brief -- when we put it in -- in the appendix to our blue brief, we did that.",
  "And I think -- but nonetheless, Justice Scalia, for the purposes of this, it is quite clear that if you were a member of Congress in 1934 reading this statute and seeing the words \"now or hereafter\" meaning now or sometime afterwards and seeing the words \"now pending,\" \"now recognized,\" \"now existing,\" and so forth, you would think that the word \"now\" meant 1934. In fact, when this Court in 1978 was construing the statute - -",
  "There are three categories, Justice Stevens.",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, if you take the word \"Indian\" out, but the word -- the phrase is \"Indian tribe.\" And Congress specifically said the word \"Indian\" wherever -- now that's where the Government says the word used as a noun doesn't mean the same as the word used as an adjective. That doesn't make any sense. But Congress was clearly talking about - - when it made three categories at the beginning of that sentence, Justice Stevens, it made three categories basically to cover the tribes that were recognized and then under jurisdiction in 1934, and that's -- the author of the statute said that in 1936. He said that in an exchange with Senator Collier. In fact, the two other Justice Department -- Interior Department documents that were reproduced were documents from the Solicitor of the Interior Department to the Indian Affairs person saying the same thing in 1978, the same thing in 1980, and the same thing in 1994. And when this Court construed the statute in -- in an indirect way with respect to the Choctaw Tribe in 1978, in the case of U.S. versus John, the Court said members of any recognized bracket, in 1934, \"tribe now under Federal jurisdiction.\"",
  "Yes.",
  "No. The meaning is quite clear. In fact, Justice Breyer - -",
  "There's no question that this tribe would not qualify - -",
  "-- and there's no contention that it would. No matter how you define that and the - - the - -",
  "Both, Justice Kennedy. They weren't either.",
  "That's correct. It does not help - -",
  "They can be recognized later, Justice Kennedy. In fact, Congress specifically did that 15 times between -- for the first time, it was 1936, and the last time it was 1994.",
  "No, because here's what Congress said: In each one of those 15 cases, Congress said - - the statute, including section 5 and 19, which is what we are talking about here, \"shall hereafter apply,\" \"shall hereafter apply,\" \"shall be hereby extended,\" \"hereby,\" \"hereby extended.\" So, Congress, on 15 occasions, decided that it was necessary to - -",
  "No, but it says the word \"Indian.\"",
  "May I read this, Justice Stevens?",
  "\"The term 'tribe' wherever used in this Act shall be construed to refer to any Indian tribe.\"",
  "So, the word - -",
  "I submit that, for purposes of construction of the statute and using the word consistently, the word \"Indian\" modifies tribe, the word \"Indian\" as defined, that's consistent with the purpose, that's consistent with the legislative history. It's consistent with the construction - -",
  "Well, I think you and I must be reading a different thing because the sentence that - - the sentence that defines the word \"Indian\" says \"the term 'Indian' as used\" - -",
  "But it does include the word \"Indian,\" which does have a temporal limitation. If it was \"brown cow\" and the word \"brown\" was defined, you would look to the word \"brown\" to determine what a brown - -",
  "Well, I think that the construction of the statute, including the way this Court read it in 1978, the history, the purpose that it was intended to accomplish, the use of those words throughout the statute which are consistent, all supports the proposition that it had meant Indian tribes recognized and under Federal jurisdiction.",
  "Yes. And if I may, Mr. Chief Justice, reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me start with Justice Kennedy's question, and I think one other justice asked about other canon of construction, specifically with respect to sovereignty of States. This Court said in Vermont Agency in 2000 if Congress is to alter the constitutional balance between States and the Federal government, it must make its intention to do so unmistakably clear; and Justice Kennedy, I think you asked that question in the context of the relationship between States and Indian tribes, and I would refer the Court to Seminole Tribe, in which the Court said the Congress must unequivocally express its intent to abrogate States' immunity. As the Chief Justice was pointing out, this is a very broad grant of authority, if it is what the government says it is. The Secretary can take property from the State, particularly a small State like Rhode Island, but it would be the same anywhere, and strip the State of jurisdiction and give jurisdiction to a dual sovereign operating within that State. We submit that the legislative history, the legislative language, the legislative purpose, the contemporary construction of the statute by the author of this statute, and everything stands for the proposition that there was some limitation intended here. I think the Government overlooks the fact and it somewhat misstates it by saying land may be taken for tribes. I've heard that several times not just in the brief but during oral argument. Section 5 which is the grant of authority says the Secretary is authorized to take land for the purposes of providing land for Indians and then section 19 defines the term Indians. Now it may -- once it decides that it may take title it may take land for Indians, it can then vest the title in -- as it says at the end of section 5 -- in individual Indians, individual Indians or tribes. But it takes lands for Indians; they have to be Indians or land cannot be taken. The other canons of construction, besides the ones that must recognize State sovereignty, is that words must be given their ordinary meaning absent a contrary context. Words are not to be considered to be superfluous. There are several instances of efforts to repeal by implication in the Government's brief; and I could go on and on. There are several violations of various canons of construction. The colloquy is clear when it's put in context. It's exactly what I think you were getting at, Justice Breyer. There is a difference between you know, Indians under jurisdiction, which is what Mr. Commissioner Collier meant, and Indians that may have had some connection with the Federal Government. That whole colloquy is explained quite clearly in the - - in the document the Government discovered in August; and it's dated 1980; it's a memorandum by the assistant solicitor, and I explains -- it explains the context. Section -- the tribe was not -- this particular tribe I submit -- and we would describe this, this question came up in a couple of the questions, was this tribe under Federal jurisdiction and should the case be remanded. I know of nothing that suggests that it was under Federal jurisdiction. I invite the Court to look at page 7 of our brief. The tribe was under State jurisdiction, under State control and there is a reference to that in an explanation in the joint appendix at pages 21a and 23a. I don't have time to elaborate on that, but that is answered there. U.S. versus - -",
  "It had -- the -- the group of Indians called the Narragansetts, yes, have history that does go way back; but the are relationship with the Federal Government was what was being considered where -- the Indian Reorganization Act is -- and that relationship did not exist at that time. U.S. v John, the bracketed phrase doesn't mean that that phrase was unambiguous. The Court clearly understood that it meant 1934, the same as Commissioner Collier meant, and the same as the statute indicated. It doesn't show that it was ambiguous. The Court was speaking in 1978, so it was quite natural -- instead of using the word \"now\" to put in bracket 1934; and it was necessary to get to that question of Indian blood which the Court finally got to in U.S. v John to -- because otherwise we wouldn't have needed to get to that question, if it had been otherwise answered as -- with respect to the meaning of section 19.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Let me reemphasize one point. The Clean Water Act itself, Congress created two distinct, mutually exclusive but complementary permitting regimes. One is fill material, which is governed by, administered by the Corps of Engineers. The other is \"other, except as permitted under section 404,\" administered by the EPA. A discharge, in answer to your question, Justice Kennedy, may be governed by one program or the other, not both. Everybody admits that, including the Respondents. The fill rule - -",
  "Yes, it does, Justice Stevens.",
  "It's mutually exclusive in terms of the issuing agency, and I think that's a very important point. We want to emphasize that, that the rules pursuant to which the Corps of Engineers administers the fill permit are the 404(b)(1) rules which Congress specified to be enacted by the EPA. So the rigorous rules governing the quality of the water that's going to be affected by these fill permits are established by the EPA. Furthermore, the State is involved, the fisheries departments are involved, the conservation area of the State of Alaska. Many different agencies are involved in this permitting process. The permits in this case followed 900 studies, the expenditure of $26 million, an evaluation by the EPA, the Corps of Engineers, the department of conservation of Alaska, and, Justice Stevens' point, finally before the permit could be issued it had to go to the EPA and the EPA had the power to veto the permit. Now, Congress determined - -",
  "No, they could not do that, Justice -- Chief Justice Roberts, because the -- Congress made a choice under sections 404 and 402. Section 402, the EPA program, is governed by those effluent limitations under 301 and 306 and standards of performance. Congress made a choice of applying section 307, which are toxic effluent limitations that apply to the 404 permits. That 307 regime which Congress selected, which is also endorsed by the EPA in the rules that the -- that the Corps must follow in administering the permit -- that 307 provision to which I just referred to is in the 404(b)(1) regime rules. So all of this, the permitting process, which Congress made the decision to put into two baskets: Either it's fill material or it's except permits under - -",
  "The -- the -- yes. I -- I think the answer to that is yes. But the better answer to that, Justice Kennedy, is for a while, as -- as General Garre pointed out, the EPA had a different concept of what was fill than the Corps of Engineers. The EPA right from the beginning said it would be the effect on the -- on the water. The Corps for a while had that definition. Then it used a purpose test. Both agencies, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers, agreed in 2002 that that \"purpose\" definition of the word \"fill\" was not workable. It was too subjective.",
  "Well, there could be disagreement, but I was just about to say that this rule was jointly adopted by the Corps of Engineers and the EPA in 2002. To the extent there is any ambiguity as to what fill material is, both the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA agree that it includes slurry from mines. So that - -",
  "That's -- that's -- except in the early stage, as I understand it, the Corps and - - the Corps also used the \"effects\" test. Then there was a period of time when it used a \"purpose\" test. The EPA consistently used the -- the \"effects\" test. In - -",
  "That's -- that's -- until that point, that's correct, Justice Ginsburg. But the two agencies that were involved in this process determined that that was not a workable test. It didn't function well. It allowed too much evasion and -- and manipulation, and they both came together after long studies and decided a reasonable interpretation that was effective, consistent, and workable. Under the Clean Water Act, both agencies came together and decided that the definition included the placement of overburden, slurry, tailings, or similar mining-related materials. Now, to the extent there is any ambiguity in the statute, this is the reasoned judgment, notice-and - comment rulemaking by the two agencies given responsibility.",
  "That's correct.",
  "No, I don't -- that does not - -",
  "I don't know where you got that. That is the result in this case.",
  "Cholesterol.",
  "Yes, I will, Justice Breyer. If it's fill, the administrating, permitting agency is the Army Corps of Engineers.",
  "But in granting that permit, in evaluating that permit, they must follow the 404(b)(1) guidelines that were drafted and written by the EPA. So that -- and EPA has all sorts of provisions. It can't have an adverse effect on the water. There cannot be a preferable environmental alternative. It must go through the Marine Fisheries. It cannot contain that toxic material that you are talking about, that worst material in the world.",
  "No - -",
  "That -- that may be, but the Rule 404(b)(1) guidelines address both that point, and I understand your point, too. But in -- on 11(a) of the Government's brief the -- the 404(b)(1) guidelines are set forth, and it includes a provision, number 2 on that page, \"violates any applicable toxic effluent standard or prohibition under section 307 of the Act.\" So the water quality is going to be regulated according to EPA standards.",
  "Pardon me?",
  "Every -- every - -",
  "Yes, there is.",
  "The difference that a regulation - -",
  "The -- there is not -- it's - - it's -- the most important thing that is present is that Congress decided that these regulations that the - - \"fill\" is different stuff. It was for a different -- it had different consequences and should be regulated in a different way. The definition - -",
  "Pardon me?",
  "Yes, yes.",
  "That's correct.",
  "And -- and -- and I'm going to reserve the balance, if I might, for rebuttal. But let me just say \"pollutant\" includes sand and rock. And what's being put in this settling area, this lake, is the sand, which is the same consistency of the bottom of the lake. It's inert material. It does not changing the chemical composition. It is not hurting the water quality of the lake.",
  "Putting sand or rocks - -",
  "Yes, it is, Justice Souter. Putting sand in the bottom of the lake is going to do that. They are going to reintroduce the fish. It will be a bigger lake with a better aquatic system when it's finished. But, yes, you are correct, in the interim the sand at the bottom of the lake will kill those fish.",
  "It's a -- it's a condition for the permit, and every agency which examined this, including the Fisheries Department, the -- the conservation agencies of the State of Alaska -- and specifically said in the administrative record that under the worst-case scenario they believe that all of that is going to take place, and there will be more fish in a bigger lake and more livable living conditions for the fish and aquatic life after this process is finished.",
  "What the Respondents would wish to do is to have this Court disagree with the agencies' interpretation of the statutes which they administer, their consistent interpretations of those statutes, and the factual findings that a whole slew of agencies made with respect to the subject matter of these permits. The preamble of the 202 -- the 2002 fill regulations specifically says -- this is 31,135 of Federal Register Volume 67 -- EPA has never sought to regulate fill material under effluent guidelines. Never. There was an agreement, a memorandum of agreement between EPA and the Corps of Engineers in 1986. It is cited at the United States Government brief at page 27. The EPA and the Corps agree -- and this is in response to your question, Justice Breyer, and I think something Justice Kennedy said and something Justice Souter said with respect to what if there are two things in the stream going into the water. Fill material remains subject to 404 permitting even if they occur in association with discharges meeting 402 criteria. That's the answer to that question. And the -- and the EPA - -",
  "306 provisions in the statute are not made applicable to 404 permitting, and the consistent regulatory history from 1973 -- and it's all set out on page 27, or summarized on page 27 of the government's brief -- are that 301 and 306 are not applicable under the 404 process. And if there was any doubt at all, there is a -- the so-called mine tailings memorandum at pages 141 through 145 of the joint appendix in which three top officials of the EPA construe what they call the rules, the regulations, and the statute. This is both agencies. Under the plain regulation language of the rule -- this is page 145a -- under the plain language of the rule and the agency's interpretation of the regulation in its preamble, the mine tailings that are to be placed into an impoundment are covered by 404. And it specifically addresses this - -",
  "That precise question, Justice Souter, is addressed on pages 143, 144, and 145 of this memorandum from top officials of the EPA, applicable to this particular mine and these particular discharges - -",
  "That's on pages 141 through 145a of the joint appendix.",
  "No, it doesn't. It says -- with due respect, Justice Stevens, it says on the bottom of page 144: \"As a result, the regulatory regime applicable to the discharges under section 402,\" and so forth. What -- I think one thing that - -",
  "There is a 402 permit in this case, too there is a 404 permit with respect to material going into the lake and a 402 permit for the material coming out of the lake into the waters of the United States.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a fundamental constitutional right. That means not only the absence of actual bias, but a guarantee against even the probability of an unfair tribunal. In short - -",
  "You have said that in the Murchison case and in a number of cases, Your Honor.",
  "Yes, the language of the Murchison case specifically says so. The Court said in that case: \"A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process. Fairness, of course, requires an absence of actual bias in the trial of cases, but our system of law has always endeavored to prevent even the probability of unfairness.\" And in that paragraph, the Court goes on - -",
  "Pardon?",
  "Yes, but that's - -",
  "But the Court has said that frequently, not only the probability of bias, the appearance of bias, the likelihood of bias, the inherent suspicion of bias. The Court has repeatedly said that in the context -- a series of contexts or cases.",
  "Well - -",
  "It's probable cause, Mr. Chief Justice. The Court frequently decides questions involving due process, equal protection, probable cause, speedy trial, on the basis not of mathematical certainty, but in this case where an objective observer would come to the conclusion -- knowing all of the facts, would come to the conclusion that a judge or jurist would probably be biased against that individual or in favor of his opponent, that would be sufficient under the Due Process Clause, we submit. The Court - -",
  "The Court -- the Court, Justice Ginsburg, has used the changes interchangeably. We think the probably -- the \"probable\" standard is the one we would advance to this Court. But the -- but the seminal case, the Tumey case, said that even if there was a possibility -- any procedure where there would be a possible temptation for the judge not to hold the balance nice, clear, and true, would be the standard. But -- and the Aetna -- in the Aetna v. Lavoie case not very many years ago, the Court repeated that standard, and that standard has been repeated again and again. The likelihood or the possibility or even the temptation --",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, let me put it this way, Justice Scalia. If -- an ordinary person would say that it would be very difficult for a judge to hold the balance nice, square, and true when that judge has just been put on the bench during the pendency of the trial of the case by his opponent's contribution of $3 million to his election.",
  "Well, I would go back to the words of this court in the Tumey case, the seminal case: \"Due process is not satisfied by the argument that men of highest honor and greatest self-sacrifice could carry it out without danger of injustice.\"",
  "Well, it's not clear. There is a - -",
  "We're not claiming that there is a basis based on personal relationship, Your Honor.",
  "Well, if I can address part of the premise of your question and invite the Court to look at page 188a of the joint appendix. This addresses the point that you just made that he was contributing his money to defeat Justice McGraw as opposed to supporting Justice Benjamin. On page 188a is one of those financial disclosure reports that's required by West Virginia law. It's filed by Mr. Blankenship and it says on that page: \"Expenditures made to support or oppose,\" and he underlines the word \"support,\" and then he types in the word \"Brent Benjamin.\" Then if you'll turn over to page 200a, which is the last page of that report, that shows that he directly spent $508,000 of his own money to support Justice Benjamin. Now, to the larger part of your point, the context of this case suggests that, while the appeal was going to be coming to the -- to the West Virginia Supreme Court, Mr. Blankenship, who was the CEO, chairman, major stockholder and a -- the prime mover in the case that gave rise to liability in this case, decided to unseat Justice McGraw, who he thought would be unfavorable to him, and elect Justice Benjamin, who he thought would be favorable to him.",
  "I think that -- I think the answer probably is not, Chief Justice Roberts, but this is, like your cases involving reasonable search and seizure, it's going to require an analysis of the complex of circumstances.",
  "I think the Court would -- a reasonable objective observer knowing all of the facts would not feel that that -- that trade group was not a party to the case, who is not personally involved in having a personal stake in the election or the outcome of that particular case, but may be interested in a panoply of cases or judges that approach things in a certain way; that would not give rise to what you're concerned about here.",
  "If those are the companies that are a party to the case, if it's when their case is pending, if it's a vast magnitude -- the magnitude - -",
  "No, I think that that - -",
  "Well, no. I think that that is -- I answered your question whether it's only those cases. That is a part of the circumstances that would give rise -- you have decided, this Court has decided that the possibility that a $12 benefit, the Tumey case, might ultimately come to the judge is a disqualifying interest. You've decided in the Monroeville case that because the adjudicator was the mayor of a town who might receive some fines - -",
  "Well, I would submit that your cases say that when the judge has an interest in the case and that interest leads to the likelihood of - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, let me -- let me answer that. There's more parts, there's more than one part to that question. Let me answer the first part first. The Court hasn't said that there are only two categories of disqualifying bias. I submit the Court has said that it's an interest in the outcome. That interest in the outcome might be financial - -",
  "I respectfully submit, Justice Scalia, that in the Monroeville case the judge didn't have a personal financial interest. He had what the Court called a partisan interest because the money that might have been assessed in the way of fines might have come to the city. In the Lavoie case, the judge didn't have a direct financial interest. He had an indirect potential financial interest. In the Johnson v. Mississippi case, the judge had been named in an institutional suit about racial bias and whether juries should be -- those -- there's a panoply of circumstances, all of which add up, Justice Scalia, I submit, to a situation where a judge is -- a reasonable person would suspect that the judge would have a hard time, in the words of this Court, \"holding the balance nice, clear, and true.\"",
  "And I was going to - -",
  "In the first place, there is a -- there is a significant difference with respect to the framers of the Constitution who gave the members of this Court and the Federal Judiciary life tenure for the very purpose of ensuring the independence of the judiciary. There is a separate consideration that this Court has mentioned because of the fact that judges and justices of this Court cannot be replaced if they feel that they must recuse themselves. There is -- another interest is institutionally presidents appointing justices all of the time for a variety of reasons, but not to attempt to affect the outcome in their case.",
  "No, Chief Justice Roberts.",
  "Well, of course they're factors and circumstances, but the -- when -- when an individual or a group of individuals makes contributions in the context of elections -- and we are going to have State elections of -- of judges. We have them in 40 -- 39 States, and there's no sign that those are going to be discontinued any time soon. But when a group of individuals or an individual is -- is making contributions because they think the jurist is going to be sensitive to -- to the rights of criminals or sensitive to the rights of victims of criminals, those are generic concerns that people participating in the electoral process - -",
  "I can't -- I can't rule out a situation where there is a potential litigant who has a stake in front of a case. The amounts here have to be taken into consideration, too.",
  "It would be - -",
  "Well, there are several answers to that. In the first place, the Conference of Chief Justices of all of the States of the United States filed a brief in this case and said that we need a standard with respect to recusals for extraordinary campaign contributions in cases. They also said that - -",
  "That's - -",
  "That's because, Justice Scalia, the -- the jurisprudence of this Court in connection with standards like due process or probable cause or speedy trial or equal protection can't be nailed down with levels of specificity. It would be very inviting --",
  "Well, I -- I -- the reason we - - we approached it from that standpoint, Justice Kennedy, is the probability of bias is something that this Court has said repeatedly. But let me answer your question this way: When the circumstances, including the timing of the contribution, the magnitude and proportion of the contribution, are such that it would lead a reasonable person in possession of all of the facts -- these are all words from these courts' decisions -- to believe that the judge would have a difficult time being other than biased in favor of one of the parties, that would be the standard that would be applied. It's a general standard, but - -",
  "-- the Conference of Chief Justices - -",
  "It is very much central, but it's not exclusively central. If the -- and -- and that is absolutely correct, Justice Ginsburg. On pages 63 through 65a of the joint appendix, for example, are the specific post-trial motion findings of the judge saying that the prime mover in the -- in the conduct that was declared to be fraudulent and a deliberate effort to drive this company out of business was Mr. Blankenship. So factually that's correct.",
  "That is a central factor. If he had given one dollar - -",
  "It's not - -",
  "Well, that's - -",
  "I submit, Justice Scalia, you're going to have to wipe out a lot of jurisprudence from this Court that uses terms like \"appearance of bias,\" \"likelihood of bias.\"",
  "Well, it would be -- it would be -- I would be delighted to say that the standard was 50 percent of the contributions in an election, and we would come along in a case where there would be a very small amount of money, and someone -- that -- that all of those situations are distinguishable. I admit this is not easy, but the Conference of Chief Justices specifically said, to get back to Justice Kennedy's question, what did they propose and are they proposing something comparable to us? They are -- they are -- and this is on page 4 of the Conference of Chief Justices' brief. They are the judges who would have to live with this decision. They said: (A), we need it, extraordinary, out of line campaign support from a source that has a substantial stake in the outcome of the proceedings where those extreme facts create a probability of actual bias. And then they go on to say, to answer the floodgate problem that my opponent raises -- this is going to open the floodgates, and you will have nothing but recusal motions. They explicitly state that concern is not -- is unfounded. No bright line rule can or should be attempted. These are the judges - -",
  "Well, the States are perfectly free to do that. But let me - -",
  "Let me make this point, Justice Scalia. The contribution limit in West Virginia is $1,000. Mr. Blankenship contributed $1,000, and then he put up three million additional dollars, three thousand - -",
  "I -- I think that this Court's -- this Court's campaign finance jurisprudence acknowledges the appropriateness of campaign contribution limits, the very point that Justice Scalia just made, and other limits. And in -- and, in fact, States have limits against corporate contributions, limits against union contributions. I think the United Mine Workers incident came up.",
  "But -- but the -- and -- and the States do have limitations with respect to what litigants can do.",
  "I think there are -- there are more than one answer to that question. One, the political process to which you refer is spiraling out of control. There is a financial arms race in judicial elections in various States throughout the country, and the briefs - -",
  "It hasn't done the job so far, and the trend seems to be in the opposite direction, but even if it - -",
  "Pardon me?",
  "I believe that is correct, but I don't think that would have addressed the problem in this case.",
  "Irrespective of that, I was going to go on and answer this in response to Justice Souter's question. The Conference of Chief Justices, I think, provide a second answer to that question. They are the ones where the rubber meets the road, so to speak. They are saying, and the entire conference is saying, we need some guidance here with respect to a constitutional limit - -",
  "I would hesitate -- I would hesitate to do so, Justice Alito. I think you've put your finger on some of the circumstances that would take it out of the context of the appearance of justice for sale. I'm going to reserve, if I may, the balance of my time, but finish with a reference to the principle that we're articulating here is not new to the jurisprudence of the western world and the legal jurisprudence that we come from. In the Magna Carta the king promised: \"To no one will we sell justice.\" And Blackstone repeated that and restated it and stated: \"For injury done to every subject, he may take his remedy by the course of law and have justice freely without sale.\" This circumstance in this case involves the appearance of judges being bought. Now, we're not saying that there's actual bias because there's actual -- as this Court has repeatedly said, that's impossible to prove, and that's why the appearance of probability of bias is so important to the respect that we need to have for the judicial system.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Scalia, you mentioned that the words \"reasonable search and seizure\" are in the Constitution. The words \"due process\" are in the Constitution, and that is what we're talking about today. This Court has repeatedly said, and I don't think my opponent objects or disagrees that due process means a fair trial in a fair tribunal. So what are we talking about today? What is a fair tribunal? He said ask yourself, could you be fair if you were in Justice Benjamin's position? That, I submit, is not the question, because this Court has repeatedly said actual bias is something that's virtually impossible to prove, the counsel of -- the Conference of Chief Justices said don't go there. We can't ever determine that. And so the question is what is -- is someone likely to be biased, likely to be unfair? And, Justice Kennedy, one of the factors that led us to the conclusion that an objective standard, that a reasonable person knowing all of the facts would probably be biased is language from a number of these court -- this Court's decisions, including your concurrence in the Liteky case -- I think it's Liteky, L-I-T-E-K-Y -- in which you said the objective observer would entertain reasonable questions about the judge's impartiality. Now, that's a case involving section 455 and not the Due Process Clause, but I think the logic with respect to the application of the test and the ability of this Court and other courts to apply it, as the Conference of Chief Justices said they could, is the same.",
  "The -- the -- there's a number of questions. In the first place, there's life tenure for federal judges. Secondly, was that appointment made - -",
  "No, I think it wouldn't be different because of all the confluence of circumstances. If a detached observer, again to use Justice Kennedy's words - -",
  "He might be running for another court, he might need the benefits. This was $3 million in a race in which that amounted to more money than everybody else collectively put into this race while this case was pending. Now, the language that I think is important is from the Tumey case, might not a defendant with reason say that he would fear he would not get a fair trial. So instead of the question that my opponent asks, would you be fair, which is not the standard because actual bias isn't the test, would there be a perception, likelihood, probability appearance of bias, to use the language used by this Court over and over again.",
  "Ask yourself this question - -",
  "As this Court has said, I think, in one of the cases that you can't allow a litigant to try to game the system in that way. What I was getting to instead of the question - -",
  "It's not going to be clear in every case, Mr. Chief Justice. It's going to be would a detached observer conclude that a fair and impartial hearing would be possible? So instead of the question that Mr. Frey was asking whether you, yourself, could be -- I would like to ask you to ask this question. If this was going to be the judge in your case, would you think it would be fair and would it be a fair tribunal if the judge in your case was selected with a $3 million subsidy by your opponent?",
  "That is the standard that this - -",
  "No, I don't think so.",
  "Then if it was a basis for a recusal, you would have to be recusing all the time, because that is a standard that's reasonable question of impartiality is in section 455, it is in many of the State codes. The courts handle these decisions all of the time. These are factors, and I think I would go back to Justice Stevens' and Justice Breyer's question, this is a situation where there has got to be some limits. Our opponents say there's -- bias tribunals are not prohibited by the Due Process Clause nor probably biased or the appearance of bias. We think there has to be some constitutional limit.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Participation in the political process is the First Amendment's most fundamental guarantee. Yet that freedom is being smothered by one of the most complicated, expensive, and incomprehensible regulatory regimes ever invented by the administrative state. In the case that you consider today, it is a felony for a small, nonprofit corporation to offer interested viewers a 90-minute political documentary about a candidate for the nation's highest office, that General Electric, National Public Radio, or George Soros may freely broadcast. Its film may be shown in theaters, sold on DVDs, transmitted for downloading on the Internet, and its message may be distributed in the form of a book. But its producers face 5 years in prison if they offer it in the home through the vehicle of Video On Demand. Because the limitation on speech, political speech, is at the core of the First Amendment, the government has a heavy burden to establish each application of a restriction on that form of speech is a narrowly tailored response to a compelling governmental interest. The government cannot prove and has not attempted to prove that a 90-minute documentary made available to people who choose affirmatively to receive it, to opt in, by an ideologically oriented small corporation poses any threat of quid pro quo corruption or its appearance. Indeed, this documentary is the very definition of robust, uninhibited debate about a subject of intense political interest that the First Amendment is there to guarantee.",
  "Well, it wouldn't -- definitely would not be the same because there are several aspects of the argument that we present. However, in one respect, it would. A 90-minute documentary was not the sort of thing that the -- the BCRA -- the Congress was intended to prohibit. In fact, as the -- as the Reporters Committee for -- for Freedom of Speech points out, the documentary is indistinguishable from other news media commentary - -",
  "Yes, we would, although it is a very important factor.",
  "Well, one of the reasons that - - one of the bases upon which you would draw the line is to look at the documentary -- the voluminous documentary record that the government cites and this Court cited in the McConnell case as a justification for the restrictions themselves. As - -",
  "Well, I think what I'm trying to say is that what the -- what the Congress was concerned with -- and Judge Kollar-Kotelly in the district court opinion that you considered in McConnell discusses this on page 646 of her opinion -- that this sort of communication was not something that Congress intended to prohibit. You would look at, if Congress intended to prohibit 90-minutes - -",
  "Well, that's part of our argument, yes. It's not - -",
  "Well, as this Court said in the Wisconsin Right to Life case just a couple years ago, that the PAC vehicle is burdensome and difficult.",
  "Yes, on page 252 of the appendix and 251, it points out -- you're absolutely correct - - that 1 percent of the contributions - -",
  "-- were from corporations.",
  "The government sent an interrogatory, Justice Ginsburg, asking for the major contributions with respect to this project, and the ones that they sought -- the government sought what they thought was important; the answer to that interrogatory is at page 251a and 252a -- that the government was seeking information with respect to contributions at a $1,000 or more; 198,000 came from individuals. And, by the way, the three largest contributors that are listed on page 252 of the Joint Appendix are given credit in the film itself. So there's no effort to -- to conceal those individuals. So that it's possible -- it's possible that corporations throughout America were giving small amounts of money to this. That record doesn't establish one way or the other. What it does establish is what the government felt was necessary for its case that the major contributors were individuals and not corporations.",
  "Well, it is difficult - -",
  "If -- not by this organization. We think that if it's a small, nonprofit organization, which is very much like the Massachusetts - -",
  "Well, General Motors may be smaller than the client that we are representing.",
  "Yes, I think that's a big step.",
  "The difference is: It's exactly what the Court was describing in Wisconsin Right To Life. It is a 90 -- it is -- it informs and educates, which is what the Court said, or the Chief Justice's opinion, the controlling opinion said, was the mark of an issue communication. And as this Court said - -",
  "What the -- what the Court said in Wisconsin Right to Life was that the distinction between an issue -- issue advocacy and campaign advocacy dissolves upon practical application. This is exactly what the Court was talking about there. And - -",
  "Yes, it did, Justice Ginsburg, but what my point is: That there isn't just two boxes in the world of communications about public issues, one box for so-called issues and one box for campaign advocacy. That's what I think the Court meant when it said, not just in Wisconsin Right to Life but in earlier cases, that the distinction dissolves upon application.",
  "It -- what -- what the court was talking about and as Justice Kollar-Kotelly talked about is broadcast advertising, these 10-minute -- 10-second, 30-second, 60-second bursts of communication that are - - that are the influence in elections.",
  "This is a long discussion of the record, qualifications, history, and conduct of someone who is in the political arena, a person who already holds public office, who now holds a different public office, who, yes, at that point, Justice Souter, was running for office. But the fact is that what could the individual making a -- as I said, the Reporters Committee for the Right to Life said this is indistinguishable from something that is on the public media every day, a long discussion. It might be -- what you're suggesting is that unless it's somehow evenhanded, unless it somehow says -- which would be viewpoint discrimination or prevention of viewpoints, which is the safe harbor that the government has written into its so-called safe harbor, if you don't have a point of view, you can go ahead and express it.",
  "The government has the burden to prove -- and there's a compelling governmental interest narrowly tailored, Justice Breyer, because all kinds of things of the type that you're talking about are permissible if your name is General Motors -- I, mean if your name is General Electric rather than General Motors, if your name is Disney, if your name is George Soros, if your name is National Public Radio. What you're suggesting is that a long discussion of facts, record, history, interviews, documentation, and that sort of thing, if it's all negative, it can be prohibited by -- and it's a felony. You can go to jail for 5 years for sharing that information with the American public, or if it's all favorable, you can go to jail. But if you did half and half, you couldn't.",
  "Because -- because of the First Amendment. Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. When -- when the government had - - when this Court has permitted that to happen, it has only done it in the most narrow circumstances for a compelling governmental interest.",
  "I understand that, Justice Kennedy, and it is difficult. But let me say that the record that you were considering in McConnell -- and I specifically invite, as I did before, page -- the Court's attention to 646 of this -- of the district court's opinion, which specifically said the government and Congress was concerned about these short, punchy ads that you have no choice about seeing, and not concerned about a thorough recitation of facts or things that you would have to make an affirmative decision to opt into. And the reason why it's difficult is that we are talking about an infinite variety of ability of people to speak about things that matter more to them than anything else, who will be - -",
  "The thing that I think it's - - it's pointed out specifically in your opinion, controlling opinion for Wisconsin Right To Life. That which informs and educates and may seek to persuade is something that is -- is on the line of being permissible. The government hasn't established -- never did try to establish -- I did shift -- I didn't shift but all of these are factors. It's who's doing the speaking.",
  "The point, I think - -",
  "The point, I think, Justice Scalia, is, yes, you can educate in 10 seconds, you can educate in 30 seconds. But what -- what the Court was trying to do -- what Congress was trying to do is get at the things that were most potentially corruptive.",
  "The government makes the point that it established a voluminous record of evidence. Both Congress had before it and this Court had before it a voluminous volume of evidence because it had the burden of proving that something was really bad with these -- these types of advertisements. And what the -- what the Court did is say, well, okay -- in McConnell -- yes, there is a substantial burden that the government met that these types of communications -- not the Internet, not books, not other types of things -- are really bad enough that the government could pick those out, and it has narrowly tailored its solution to that problem by prohibiting those things. And the government talks about today in its brief the things that Congress felt were the most acute problems. Now - -",
  "I'm making a - -",
  "Yes, I am making a statutory argument in the sense that you will construe the statute in the ways that doesn't violate the Constitution. The Constitution, as -- as the Court said in Wisconsin Right to Life, gives ties to the speaker, errs on the side of permitting the speech, not prohibiting the speech. And so all those things may be statutory arguments, Justice Scalia, but they are also constitutional arguments. And in response to every one of these questions, the government has the burden of proving this sort of speech, which the Reporters say is indistinguishable, than the kind of information that news media puts out all the time, not - -",
  "I don't think, Chief Justice Roberts, that it is remotely the functional equivalent of express advocacy, because what the Court and Congress was thinking about with respect to express advocacy was short, punchy things that you have no - -",
  "I -- I think I would agree with that, but I would also say that the -- the idea, the functional equivalent of express advocacy is the very magic word problem that this Court has struggled with in McConnell and in -- in each of the cases. I would -- I said at the beginning that this is an incomprehensible prohibition, and I -- and my -- I think that's demonstrated by the fact that since 2003 this Court has issued something close to 500 pages of opinions interpreting and trying to apply the First Amendment to Federal election law. And I counted 22 separate opinions from the Justices of this Court attempting to -- in just the last 6 years, attempting to figure out what this statute means, how it can be interpreted. In fact - -",
  "There would be fewer -- there would be fewer opinions. I guess my point is that - -",
  "I think this presents a much easier issue, Justice Stevens, because this is the type of -- if there is anything that the First Amendment is intended to protect in the context of elections that are occurring -- which, by the way, occur 4 years running, but the last election, presidential election occurred throughout the entire 2008 -- if the American people need to have that kind of information. And the statute is both overly broad because if it were a hotel ad, if it was a hotel saying Senator Clinton stayed here or Senator McCain stayed here, it would be prohibited because it was a hotel saying so, even though it really had nothing to do with the election. If it is -- but it's -- if it's a corporation that put together an analysis of the earmark positions of each of the senatorial candidates -- most all of the candidates were running from the Senate, they all had this -- these issues where they may have voted or not against earmarks, that would - -",
  "Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I understand your point. There is much in there that if you saw it, you would form an opinion with respect to how you might want to vote. You might -- it might form a different -- you might form all kinds of different opinions. But it was -- it was an analysis of the background record and history and qualifications of someone running for president, of course I concede that. But what is the -- what is the maker of a movie to take out in order to prevent that from happening? I understand from some of the questions that if it was more evenhanded -- if it said, well, this candidate did this, but this candidate did this or this candidate was born in the Panama Canal Zone and this candidate was born in Hawaii, and that affects whether or not they are natural-born citizens or not, and it was more evenhanded, would that then not be a felony?",
  "Well, it is a distinction that Congress was concerned about, and it's a distinction that's all over the record - -",
  "Because -- because the record in Congress and the record in this Court is that those types of advertisements were more effective because they came into your home - -",
  "The -- the -- I think the - - what -- what Congress was concerned about is the most severe and the most acute problem, as Justice Kollar-Kotelly said, which everyone acknowledges was the problem Congress sought to address with BCRA. It's not just that, however. The point that you just made about a nonporous border, it is the government's responsibility to the extent that you can't figure out how evenhanded you must be or what you must take out of your communication in order not to go to jail for airing it, it is the functional equivalent -- if everything is the functional equivalent that mentions a candidate during an election, which is what the government says, it's the functional equivalent of a prior restraint, because you don't dare - -",
  "I agree with that completely, Justice Scalia. Mr. Chief Justice, if I may reserve the remainder of my time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. It is unquestionably the case that the government takes the position that any form of expression, of expressive advocacy can be prohibited if it's done by a corporation. They say that on page 25 and 26 of their brief, whether it be books, yard signs, newspapers or -- or something printed -- in printed form, and it's only because Congress decided to address the most acute problem that they haven't -- Congress didn't go ahead and decide to do that, which we submit would raise very, very serious constitutional questions, the same type of constitutional questions that we are talking about here, and that - -",
  "Precisely, and the five justices in Wisconsin Right to Life made the fact that the PAC mechanism is burdensome and expensive. There are briefs in this case that demonstrate how much it is. And the -- and it's easier if you have lots of money, if you are a big corporation, and you can afford a PAC or you already have one. So it's a burden on the least capable of communicating.",
  "Of course.",
  "By definition.",
  "What I am saying is I -- we accept the Court's decision in Wisconsin Right to Life. To the extent that the Court did not get to this type of documentary where the issue distinction, the false dichotomy between issues and candidates - -",
  "The -- the -- that no reasonable, not reasonably susceptible to any other interpretation? Of course we do, Justice Stevens, but we submit, a 90-minute discussion of various different issues are subject to all kinds of interpretation, and when you get a long exposition of issues that are important to the public and someone says -- the government says, it's going to be -- well, we can prohibit it, and by the way, the government says, well, when we mean prohibit we mean, you just can't use your union, or corporate treasury funds -- what they mean by prohibit is that they will put you in jail if you do it. They will put you in jail for five years. That means prohibited. Now, what -- what we're getting at here, when -- when you're trying to make a 90-minute movie that discusses things that are important to the public during an election of the highest officer of the United States, many people will interpret that as critical; many people will interpret it as supportive; there are things all over the lot. So it's subject to lots of different interpretations. The other thing is I heard Justice -- I mean Mr. Stewart say that there's one minute at the beginning, it doesn't happen -- it doesn't matter what the other 89 minutes are; we can prohibit it. Well, where is the person making a movie who wants to address the American public about something that's important to the American public -- there isn't any question about that -- where does he edit his movie? What cuts? What does he leave on the drawing -- on the cutting room floor so that he won't have to go to bail -- jail? He won't dare take a chance.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the Wheeling case, this Court said it is too well settled to question the taxes upon vessels based upon their value as property do not violate the Tonnage Clause. In fact, no ad valorem property tax has ever been held to violate the Tonnage Clause.",
  "Yes, Justice Kennedy, precisely in the same manner as other ad valorem property taxes. Now let me answer the question that both you and Justice Breyer particularly addressed, which was the oil and - - and gas tax imposed with respect to much of the property in Valdez. Valdez taxes homes, it taxes oil and gas property, it taxes barges, it taxes cruises, it taxes all sorts of things just like every other jurisdiction does. The oil and gas tax that you ask about, Justice Kennedy, and you did, too, Justice Breyer, is imposed -- and there is no need to remand this case to address this. It's in Section 43.56 of the Alaska Code. The State of Alaska imposes an oil and gas tax on property used in the oil and gas extraction, transportation, et cetera, business, but it also authorizes a city under Section 43.56 and 29.45 -- the City of Valdez may impose that tax as well. It's two mils, it's just like every other tax that is imposed in Valdez. These are taxes imposed on the same basis. If the city imposes the tax, which the City of Valdez does, then the tax by the State -- that tax paid to Valdez is a direct credit, dollar for dollar credit, for the tax that would otherwise have to go to the State. So, in the first place, I think would it make no difference as suggested by your question, Justice Breyer, whether it was the State or the city that imposed the tax. The constitutional provision refers to states. States divide up their taxing authorities in various different ways. The fact is that the State of Alaska through the City of Valdez imposes a tax on lots of different things. This oil and gas tax that we are talking about consists of 60 to 70 percent of the revenue base of taxation for the City of Valdez. The -- the ship tax, the tax on the -- that actually applies to vessels which include the tankers, include barges, include a cruise ship, includes just Alaska ships and -- and ships - -",
  "The fishing - -",
  "They don't have to pay this tax, Justice Scalia, but they pay other taxes. There is tax on -- on the weight of fish and there is tax on the value of fish and there's tax -- there's -- fees, they use a different dock and they pay taxes there, to.",
  "No.",
  "No. Well, that is not correct, if I understood your -- your statement correctly. This oil and gas property, cranes, heavy equipment, fire engines, motor vehicles, everything else, including the people's home in Valdez get taxed.",
  "No, that's with respect to mobile homes.",
  "They are taxed as real property when they are affixed in that way.",
  "The tax -- cities may impose taxes as real property or -- or personal property, Justice Scalia. Some states will tax mobile homes.",
  "No, Justice Kennedy. I have -- I've given you - -",
  "The -- there are various taxes imposed by Valdez on personal property and real property.",
  "Your statement is correct only with respect to the ordinance that -- that eliminated the exception. These big ships that impose enormous burdens on the municipality, you can only imagine what three, four hundred - -",
  "Yes, I know. But these ships were exempt from taxation in Valdez until the year 1999 when that ordinance that you are referring to, Justice Kennedy, was adopted. It eliminated - -",
  "Except -- except, under the - - to the extent that that personal property was covered by the oil and gas tax, the provisions that I have referred to, Valdez had been imposing that tax.",
  "If the Wheeling case is correct and the other cases that have repeatedly said this, there is no constitutional impediment for a city or a state to impose a property tax on property being used in - -",
  "There -- well, I -- I think what my point here with respect to this, Justice Ginsburg, is I don't know the answer specifically to that question, but we are looking at what the bundle of taxes that a community or a state imposes on property used that imposes a burden on the community. Property is taxed for the purpose, so that the property owner will bear the burden of the governmental services that a city has to impose. It -- there is no constitutional provision that I am aware of that says that you have to have it all in one statute, collected -- and there is no discrimination - -",
  "Well, I disagree in part with what you said, with respect, Justice Scalia; these shelves pay 11 percent -- vessels pay 11 percent of the revenue base for the city; 11 percent. This is a city of 4,500 people.",
  "This is the amount of tax collected by the City of Valdez with respect to the ad valorem taxes in the city, including ships, mobile homes, cranes, barges, appliances, real property, and so forth.",
  "Pardon me.",
  "I am -- I am saying to you that the State imposes a tax but the State specifically allows valid to impose that very tax.",
  "Valdez imposes that tax as a part of its total taxation package.",
  "The answer is - -",
  "The answer is Section 43.56 that allows -- the State statute may impose that tax you just described. And it -- and section 29.",
  "Yes, it does impose it, and then, Justice Breyer - -",
  "-- section 29.45.080 says -- I am going to read it exactly; this seems to be an important point. It doesn't seem to me that it ought to make any difference from the Tonnage Clause standpoint whether it's a tax imposed by the State or a subdivision of the State, but this provision specifically says a municipality may levy and collect taxes on taxable property, taxable under AS 43. That's the one. The State does impose this tax but it also allows the city to impose it. This city does impose it. And when it is paid, that is a credit against what might otherwise be owed to the State. So the city does impose that tax, it does collect that tax, and that tax is not - -",

  "No.",
  "No, the ships do not pay more. I don't think it would make any difference if -- if the city decided to impose a different rate of tax on motor vehicles than it did on homes or -- or vessels, as long as it was an ad valorem property tax, and this one is. The vessels are not based -- the tax is assessed every year on the replacement value of the vessels. A big ship that is worth less money because it would cost less to replace it, because it doesn't have a double hull or a double bottom, will be taxed -- it will be taxed greater in proportion to its value. The value imposed is assessed every year. There's no challenge here -- it's very important to understand that there is no challenge by the Petitioners with respect to the valuations placed on these ships. There's no contention that the value placed upon these ships by this ad valorem property tax is based upon cubic capacity. They have - -",
  "I do contest that, Justice Ginsburg. The only citation for that is Justice Miller. Justice Miller is cited for that in a lecture that he gave after he left the Court.

In the Wheeling case, when it said - -",
  "It is not - -",
  "That is not correct, Justice Scalia, and it's -- and it's not correct in this case. Experts put an assessment on these ships based upon their replacement value. It may have -- one factor may be how -- how the ship is constructed, whether it has a double hull. These have to be Jones Act-compliant ships. The newer ones are more valuable. If they move faster, they're more valuable. If they're more efficient, they have more value. One of these ships in this case is valued 10 times more as -- higher value - - than a ship that carries more capacity because it's newer.",
  "And - -",

  "That's not a tonnage tax.",
  "To the extent that the tax is on a vessel as an instrument of commercial conveyance, what this Court has said - -",
  "I have - -",
  "Let's start on the basics.",
  "When the Constitution was written, the Constitution did not intend to take away the power from the States to impose taxes. The provision on the import-export prohibition on the States and Tonnage Clause was an instrument to protect commerce. It wasn't an instrument to reduce the power of States to impose taxes. The baseline is States have the power to impose taxes unless there's an explicit - - and the court has said narrow -- limitation on that tax power in the Constitution. Now, what this Court has said over and over again, Justice Breyer -- it hasn't had a chance to deal with portholes -- but it has had a chance to deal with most of these various earlier cases in the -- in the 1860s and '70s had to do with tax on tonnage. And there was one case where New Orleans levied a tax just for the entry and departure of the ship, and the Court said, well, that's -- that's a tax on the ship as a -- as a commercial instrument of commerce, and that would be covered also. But nothing else has been covered. And the Court has gone out of its way to say that communities, States, are entitled to tax people that possess property within their jurisdiction because of - -",
  "Because -- because, if you are taxing -- I think that the Court had reasons for the conclusion it came to. What I'm saying is not what I've invented; it's what the Court has said repeatedly, that because property may be taxed as property because the users and owners of property are the source of revenue for the communities - -",
  "It does - -",

  "No, because -- for - -",
  "No, Justice Scalia - -",
  "What the Framers were concerned about and what I was trying to say in response to the Chief Justice's question is that there was a limitation on the states' power to tax imports or exports because of the fact that that would put the states on the coast at an advantage and they would pass those burdens on to the inland states. The Tonnage Clause was put there as a specific provision to implement and -- to prevent the circumvention of the export/import prohibition.",
  "You can - -",
  "If do it would be - -",
  "That then might -- that might be a Due Process Clause problem - -",
  "But it wouldn't be a Tonnage Clause problem. I would submit, Justice Scalia, you would be very upset at the -- at Silicon Valley because the property tax imposed on Silicon Valley gets all put on those chips that we used in all of these computers, and everybody else in the country is using those computers, so the property that is taxed in that community is the property that creates the value of that community.",
  "And Justice Scalia - -",
  "You would -- you would, I submit, then, say that vessels are exempt from property tax.",
  "Well, it's going to require an amendment to the Constitution because what the Framers talked about was a Tonnage Clause, and they were talking about - -",
  "-- and they did not exempt - -",
  "Well, I guess I have to resort to the fact that every time this Court has considered it, or at least in almost every case, the Court has gone out of its way to say, they were not intending to prohibit states from taxing the value of property, if it's an ad valorem tax.",
  "If this -- this is an ad valorem tax, it has various different statutes and ordinances that it comes from, but there's ad valorem taxes in Valdez across the board for all kinds of property.",
  "Well, there -- no. This statute is -- every other statute in the same manner imposes taxes on property based upon their value. This was a separate ordinance that decided to remove an exemption that had existed for 27 years - -",
  "Well, I think what we are talking about is whether or not this community can impose a tax on the people that own property in this community. There's no denial that there is a property tax situs here. The average length of the time in port of these ships was 45 days. The entire fleet has a tax situs in Valdez. So this property, like other property in the same manner, is being taxed by the City of Valdez. The Wheeling case was a case a little bit like this in the sense that it was West Virginia that passed a statute that allowed Wheeling to impose the tax on steam ships.",
  "The only thing that the Court talked about because it was -- like this it was an as-applied case, the taxpayer was wanting a refund from the taxes and the taxpayer owned steam ships that - - that went back and forth from Wheeling. And the Court talked about the fact that this wasn't a Tonnage Clause, this was a state-authorized municipal -",
  "And what -- what the thrust of the overall bulk of the cases including the language by this Court repeatedly is that property taxation based upon the value of property, not imposing a value -- not imposing a tax on the ship. There are various ways I suppose one could say that every time a ship enters a harbor without developing a tax situs -- I think Justice Alito's question focused on that -- this is not - -",
  "You don't get charged a fee for entering the port. Or one of those cases when - - imposes a tax because -- it called it a wharfage tax, but you didn't have to touch the wharf to pay the tax.",
  "I think -- I think you're correct, Justice Stevens, that what the Framers were concerned about was a substitute for -- export or import tax by taxing what was in the ship, and that tonnage referred to that, but it wasn't the value of the vessel itself because the Court -- the Framers wouldn't have wanted to take away the power of the states to tax commercial activity using property in their communities in the same manner that they taxed other property.",
  "The wharfage tax -- the wharfage tax has been upheld by this Court frequently. The only reason why it was struck down in that case is that you didn't have to put into the wharf. So the Court knew it wasn't really a wharfage tax, but if it was really a wharfage tax, the Court has upheld it.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Robust debate about candidates for elective office is the most fundamental value protected by the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. Yet that is precisely the dialogue that the government has prohibited if practiced by unions or corporations, any union or any corporation. The government claims it may do so based upon the Austin decision that corporate speech is by its nature corrosive and distorting because it might not reflected actual public support for the views expressed by the corporation. The government admits that that radical concept of requiring public support for the speech before you can speak would even authorize it to criminalize books and signs. This Court needs no reminding that the government when it is acting to prohibit, particularly when it is acting to criminalize, speech that is at the very core of the First Amendment has a heavy burden to prove that there is a compelling governmental interest that -- that justifies that prohibition and that the regulation adopted, in this case a criminal statute, is the most narrowly tailored necessary to accomplish that compelling governmental interest.",
  "What the Court has said in the First Amendment context, New York Times v. Sullivan, Rose Jean v. Associated Press, and over and over again, is that corporations are persons entitled to protection under the First Amendment.",
  "Now, Justice - -",
  "The Court in the past has made no distinction based upon the nature of the entity that might own a share of a corporation.",
  "Pardon?",
  "I submit that the Court's decisions in connection with the First Amendment and corporations have in the past made no such distinction. However - -",
  "I'm not -- I'm not saying that, Justice Ginsburg. I'm saying that the First Amendment applies. Then the next step is to determine whether Congress and the government has established a compelling governmental interest and a narrowly tailored remedy to that interest. If the Congress -- and there is no record of that in this case of which I am aware. Certainly the government has not advanced it in its briefs: That there is some compelling governmental interest because of foreign investment in corporations. If there was, then the Court would look at, determine how serious is that interest, how destructive has it been to the process and whether the -- maybe the limitation would have something to do with the ownership of shares of a corporation or some - -",
  "The -- the - -",
  "That's, of course, a different question. I haven't studied it, Justice Scalia.",
  "The fundamental point here is - - and let me start with this, and I think we should -- we should start with this, and the government hardly mentions this.",

  "I would not rule that out, Justice Stevens. I mean, there may be. I can't imagine all of the infinite varieties of potential problems that might exist, but -- but we would eventually come back to the narrow tailoring problem anyway. What the government has done here is prohibit speech. I don't know how many unions there are in this country, but there are something like 6 million corporations that filed tax returns in 2006.",
  "I don't think so, Justice Alito, and certainly there is no record to suggest that there is any kind of problem based upon that. And I come back to the language of the First Amendment: \"Congress shall make no law.\" Now, what this Court has repeatedly said is that there may be laws inhibiting speech if there is a compelling governmental interest and a narrowly tailored remedy. But there is no justification for this. I was going to say that 97 percent of the 6 million corporations that filed tax returns in 2006 had assets less than $5 million -- assets, not net worth. So we are talking about a prohibition that covers every corporation in the United States, including nonprofit corporations, limited liability corporations, Subchapter S corporations and every union in the United States.",
  "I respectfully disagree. The corporation may not expend money. It might find people, stockholders or officers, who wanted to contribute to a separate fund, who could then speak. That in one -- to use the words of one Justice, that is ventriloquist-speak. I would say that it is more like surrogate speech. If you can find some other people that will say what you want to say and get them to contribute money through a process that this just - -",
  "Well, this statute is not limited to cases where the shareholders agree or don't agree with what the corporation says. As the Court said in the Bellotti case, the prohibition would exist whether or not the shareholders agree. But let me go back to your question.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. And it includes membership corporations such as Citizens United that - -",
  "No -- well, what this Court has said is that in connection with contribution limitations there is a potential compelling governmental interest.",
  "This is what Buckley says.",
  "Then that -- in that -- but expenditures, which is what we are talking about today, do not concern the -- the question, the actual threat of quid pro quo corruption or the appearance of quid pro quo corruption. And you know, Justice Breyer, what the Court said in that case is because it's not inhibiting someone from actually speaking, it's -- it's giving money to someone - -",
  "Well, in the first place, I accept what the Court said in Buckley, that expenditures do not raise that concern at all. Congress has not made that finding. You are talking -- and you mentioned just -- just a matter of radio and television, but in Buckley v. Valeo the Court specifically said that that is the most important means of communicating concerning elections - -",
  "And the Court used the word \"indispensable.\" So what -- and -- and what the Court said in Buckley v. Valeo is it compared a limitation on expenditures, independent uncoordinated expenditures, with the prohibition that the Court addressed when it had a statute before it that said newspapers couldn't endorse candidates on the day of election, and the Torneo case, where it required a right of reply to be given. And the Court said those restrictions, which were unconstitutional, were considerably less, and that the restriction in Buckley v. Valeo on expenditures - -",
  "Well, in the first place, if there is any coordination - -",
  "Buckley says - -",
  "Well, it may not always be true. In the infinite potential applications of something like that, Justice Kennedy, anything might possibly be true. And Justice Breyer said, well, what if Congress thought or what if Congress thought the people might think that that was kind of somehow suspect? That is not a basis for prohibiting speech by a whole class of individual - -",
  "You must always second-guess Congress when the First Amendment is in play. And that we are arguing -- we are not -- we are discussing - -",
  "-- both the compelling - -",
  "-- both the compelling governmental interest and the narrow tailoring, and what -- what -- there is not a sufficient record. The reason --the government has shifted position here. They were, first of all, talking about the so-called distortion rationale in Austin, the distortion rationale which they seem to have abandoned in the -- in the supplemental briefs filed in connection with this argument, and they resorted to the corruption, appearance of corruption. There isn't a sufficient record of this. There isn't - -",
  "The find -- yes. I -- there is something to that effect in the district court opinion, but it doesn't cover all corporations. It didn't focus in specifically on expenditures.",
  "Well, that is 97 percent of the corporation.",
  "I think that goes back to Justice Kennedy's question, and my response, which distinguishes between contributions and expenditures. The point that Justice Kennedy was making in his question is that under -- under some circumstances an expenditure might coincide or resonate with what the candidate wishes to do, but the Court looked at that very carefully in Buckley v. Valeo and said that might not be the case. It might, in fact, be these expenditures might be counterproductive when they are independent, they are not coordinated with the candidate, they are more directly expression by the party spending the money, they are not like a contribution, so they are more of an infringement on the right to speak.",
  "And they are less of a threat of corruption because there is less -- there is no quid pro quo there, and if there is it would be punishable as a crime.",
  "Well, it is -- it is -- what the Bellotti Court said is that we are not deciding that question. And -- and Austin did address, you are correct, expenditures, but it based it on a rationale - -",
  "Yes. And I also read the footnote 14 in the Bellotti case that cited case after case after case that said corporations had rights, protected rights under the First Amendment. I am not disagreeing with what you just said, Justice Stevens. The Court said it was -- it was dicta, because the Court did not deal with - -",
  "Well, because it was -- and I agree the Bellotti Court was not discussing that. But The Bellotti Court - -",
  "I understand and I don't disagree with what you have just said, Justice Stevens.",
  "That -- that is -- that's the point I'm trying to make.",
  "What Bellotti also said is - - and I think this is also in many decisions of this Court -- the inherent worth of speech in terms of its capacity for informing the public does not depend upon the identity of the source, whether corporation, association, union, or individual.",
  "Well - -",
  "There is a distinction, but I think the distinction goes back to, A, expenditures versus contributions, number one; and then secondly, it goes back to what this Court said in conjunction with the impossibility of finding a distinction between issue ads and candidate ads. The line dissolves on practical application. The interest - -",
  "You said that repeatedly, including most recently in the Wisconsin Right to Life case. And it first appeared in Buckley itself. The distinction is very hard to draw between the interest that the speaker is addressing and whether it's a candidate or an issue, because issues are wrapped up in candidates. The corporation interest and the interests that its fiduciary officers are representing when it speaks on behalf of the corporation - -",
  "Well, but the words - -",
  "Well, what the Court -- to use -- to use the words of the Court, which occurred repeatedly, is that the distinction dissolves impractical application. That, Justice Stevens, I think addresses the very commonsense point that when you are addressing an issue, whether you are addressing a referendum matter, whether it is a proposed legislation or a candidate that is going to raise taxes on the corporation, those distinctions dissolve. It's all First Amendment freedom.",
  "Yes.",
  "The $1,000 limit in Buckley was, first of all, limited to the magic words \"candidacy expression\"; then secondly, the Court -- and the -- and the words of the statute were \"any person,\" which included corporations found, the statute as narrowed unconstitutional and said - -",
  "Some of the plaintiffs were corporations.",
  "It was not discussed in the opinion.",
  "But what was discussed in the opinion was the breadth of the definition of \"person,\" which did include corporation. Corporations were parties in the case. And in that part of the Buckley case, the Court repeatedly cites cases involving corporations, including NAACP v. Alabama and New York Times v. Sullivan, all cases involving corporations. So while it wasn't specifically discussed, it was a part of the decision of the Court that a $1,000 limitation was worse, more restrictive than the -- than the restriction of editorials appearing on election day or requiring a newspaper to give a right of reply. The Court in Buckley in fact says, this is -- with respect to that expenditure limitation, the words of the Court were this is the most drastic of the limitations imposed by the Federal Election Campaign Act. It goes to the core of First Amendment freedom.",
  "I think you are wrong about the consequence. There are 27 States that have no limitations on either contributions or expenditures and that -- the Earth is not - -",
  "Well, if -- if the Court decides in favor of the arguments that we are making here, I think what you are suggesting is that because there are other limitations that someone has not challenged in this case, that that would be somehow unfair and unbalanced.",
  "What -- I want to address that in this way, and I said when we were here before the most fundamental right that we can exercise in a democracy under the First Amendment is dialogue and communication about political candidates. We have wrapped up that freedom, smothered that freedom, with the most complicated set of regulations and bureaucratic controls. Last year the Federal Election Commission that was supposed to be able to give advisory opinions didn't even have a quorum for 6 months of the year 2008 when people would have needed some help from the Federal Election Commission. What I am saying, in answer to your question, Justice Breyer, there are, I suspect, all kinds of problems with Federal election laws where they apply to parties and where they apply to what candidates might do and so forth; but that has never been a justification. We will uphold a prohibition on all kinds of people speaking because if we allowed them to speak someone else might complain that they don't get to speak as much as they would like.",
  "No, I'm not, and that's -- I think that was what I was attempting to say in response to what Justice Breyer was asking me.",
  "No, Justice Sotomayor. What - - what -- there are all kinds of lines that the Court could draw which would provide a victory to my client. There are so many reasons why the Federal Government did not have the right to criminalize this 90-minute documentary that had to do with elections, but what the Court addressed specifically in the Washington Right to Life case is that the lines if they are to be drawn must not be lines that are ambiguous, that invite litigation, that hold the threat of prosecution over an individual; and in practical application that is what the - -",
  "I would like to answer that. There are several answers to it and I would like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal. It is the government has the burden to prove the record that justifies telling someone that wants to make a 90-minute documentary about a candidate for president that they will go to jail if they broadcast it. The government has the obligation and the government had a long legislative record and plenty of opportunity to produce that record and it's their obligation to do so.",
  "I will, Justice Stevens.",
  "Every line, including the lines that would be drawn in several of the amicus briefs, and they are not the same, could put the entity who wishes to speak before you again a year from now. Because the movie might be shorter, it might be video on demand, it might be a broadcast, it might have a different tone with respect to a candidate. Every one of those lines puts the speaker at peril that he will go to jail or be prosecuted or there will be litigation, all of which chills speech and inhibits individual - -",
  "I would like to take advantage of Justice Stevens' offer and respond to that during the rebuttal, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The words that I would leave with this Court are the Solicitor General's. The government's position has changed. The government's position has changed as to what media might be covered by congressional power to censor and -- and ban speech by corporations. Now we learn, contrary to what we heard in March, that books couldn't be prohibited but pamphlets could be prohibited. We also learn - -",
  "Unless they are engaged in, quote, \"expressed advocacy.\" And the other way in which the government has changed its position, if I listened carefully, is what type of corporation might be covered. The government now says that it wouldn't -- the -- the FEC is now willing to recede from its regulations which explicitly covered this corporation, and I don't know as I stand here today what kind of corporations the government would choose to prosecute. Remember, the Federal Election Commission, which didn't even have a quorum and couldn't function at all for six months during the important election year of",
  "Well, that's your question from before.",
  "And that -- (a), it wouldn't - - this corporation accepted a small amount, $2,000 out of -- out of the funding of this, so that wouldn't solve the problem for my corporation, my client's corporation.",
  "If -- but the - -",
  "My point is that the overbreadth in this statute -- that solves the problem by saying that corporations still can't speak, and if you don't have anything to do with them, you -- you -- they wear a scarlet letter that says \"C.\" If you accept one dollar of funding, then you had better make darn sure that when a check comes in for $100 from the XYZ hardware store in the neighborhood, that it wasn't a corporation that you used to -- to make a documentary about a candidate. The other way in which the government's position has changed is we do not know - -",
  "I -- I submit that it does not solve the problem. It would lead exactly - -",
  "It -- I can't say that it -- if it solved the problem, because it doesn't solve the problem of prohibiting all corporate speech. And I think -- and I am submitting, Justice Stevens, that that is unconstitutional. I think what you are suggesting is that some limitation that -- what -- what you were suggesting is not a whole lot different than PAC. It would lead, I think Justice Breyer was saying, to an accounting nightmare. It would be - -",
  "Well, but the -- but the Wellstone Amendment sort of in a sense repealed it.",
  "Well - -",
  "I think what -- what the -- my response is that that does not solve the problem of inhibiting - -",
  "No, we don't Justice Stevens, and -- and, as I said, it would not exempt my clients. The other -- the third way in which the government has changed its position is its rationale for this prohibition in the first place. Is it corruption? Is it shareholder protection? Is it equalization? There was some dispute. I heard the Solicitor General say that the equalization rationale was something the government disavowed. It wasn't what Austin said, the government -- the government said. And I - -",
  "I don't -- I don't -- with all due respect Justice Ginsburg, the words that jump out at me are the words from page 665 that say the desire to counterbalance those advantages unique to the corporate forum is the state's compelling interest in this case. That sounds to me like -- like equalization. I don't know. I am -- I am representing an individual who wants to speak about something that's the most important thing that goes on in our democracy. I'm told it's a felony. I am not -- and I -- I don't know what the rational basis is. It's overbroad. Now I hear about this shareholder -- protecting shareholders. There is not a word in the congressional record with respect to the -- which was before the Court in the McConnell case about protecting shareholders. As the Bellotti case pointed out, that would be overbroad anyway because this statute applies to every - -",
  "Well, it -- it -- it strikes me that it is, because it follows the words that say corporations are given unique advantages to aggregate wealth and that we must take away that advantage by equalizing the process. I think that's the plain meaning but my point I guess is -- if I may finish this sentence.",
  "My point is that the government here has an overbroad statute that covers every corporation irrespective of what its stockholders think, irrespective of whether it's big, and whether it's general -- a big railroad baron or anything like that, and it doesn't know, as it stands here today two years after this movie was offered for -- to the public for its view, what media might be covered, what type of corporation might be covered and what compelling justification or narrow standard would be applied to this form of speech.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress expressly exempted from Social Security taxes wages paid to a student who is enrolled and regularly attending classes. The medical residents at Petitioners' schools are enrolled and pursuing a formal accredited curriculum that has a rigorous core curriculum, as I said; hundreds of classes, conferences, lectures; laboratory research; written exams; grades; and intensive, hands-on clinical patient training under the supervision of faculty members.",
  "I don't know -- I don't know whether all -- as I understand, the resident program, which is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, does involve an accreditation program which would probably fit -- where it's taking place, would probably fit the definition of schools. That is certainly not an issue in this case. There are -- these -- the institutions that we represent -­",
  "Well, that was a judgment that Congress made. Congress made the exemption with respect to students, and it tied specifically in to someone who is enrolled and regularly attending classes -­",
  "The only reason I'm hesitating, Justice Ginsburg, is I don't know the entire universe out there. Every program, residents' program, that has been involved in the various cases that have discussed this have been at schools or universities or colleges. I'm aware of no program that involves residency and resident programs accredited by the ACGME that is not involve in and does not take place in a school or a university or college. So it could be something out there that I am not aware of, but I'm not aware of anything of that nature. It is undisputed that these individuals in these residents' programs are enrolled and that they are regularly attending classes by various definitions of the word \"class.\" The clinical experience that they are receiving in hospital rooms, in lecture halls, in all circumstances that they're involved in, are educational. They are classes, and it is undisputed -- undisputed -­ that the purpose of these programs is to educate doctors so that they can achieve board certification and hospital privileges.",
  "Well, there's two parts to that question. The answer to the second part is: Of course not. There is not a supervising attending physician standing over their shoulder at every moment, but they are being supervised at all of the time during their residency program; that is to say that the work that they do is under the supervision, in that broad sense, of an attending physician who looks over what they do, comments on what they do, and so forth.",

The fact is, as every court that has considered the question has concluded, is that these residents are under supervision. It -- you may be supervised if someone's not standing over your shoulder.

  "That is the fallacy that the government is making, that you have to either be a student or an employee. That argument is not correct, because in all other respects, these residents are employees. The exemption provided in 3121(b)(10) does not come into play unless you are an employee. So for all those purposes, Title VII, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and so forth -- those are other statutes that define the term in a certain way. What the -- what the code says in 3121(b)(10) -- that you are an employee, but if you are an employee of a college or a university and you are a student, which means you are enrolled in classes and regularly taking a program for the purpose of education, then you don't pay FICA taxes. It doesn't have any other implication. And the Government's position in that respect, and the argument that's made in the other briefs, is -- are classic red herrings. They distract from the real issue. You don't have to be either an employee or a student. In fact, you have to be both for this exemption to apply, and that is what is happening here. Now, again, this is -- there may be circumstances where there might be something that's close to the line and the government might say, well, you're not really a student. And the government really tried that in the Second Circuit, in the Sixth Circuit, and the Eleventh Circuit, and -- and the Seventh Circuit.

They're just doing it long and arduously, and they're doing it for several years so that they can be board certified as good doctors in their specialty. The idea that somehow you are a student if you do it for 39 hours, and if you do it for 41 hours -­ the programs are rigorous. They -- they have been designed by the accreditation programs to be rigorous, so that the -- a doctor will see lots of patients, do lots of clinical work, because that, according to all of the record in all of the cases, is where the education takes place. You need the classes. You need the laboratory. But you need to work with patients doing the things that we want doctors to be doing with respect to us when they are certified as a specialist in neurology or whatever it might be. So Justice Breyer, the idea that -- this is a classic definition of not only an arbitrary but a capricious and irrational regulation. It says that if -- even if you are a student, you're -- you're doing the things where you would have to be a student, and you're doing the types of things that you would make -­ make you a student, and you're doing it for the purpose that would make you for a student, but if you do it a little bit too much, you're too much of a student, and, therefore, you're not a student.",
  "It doesn't make sense.",
  "But that -­",
  "I submit that that makes no sense at all, because if you're -- if you're studying, and you're doing it for 39 and a half hours, you're a student, and if you do it for 40 and a half hours, all of a sudden you're not doing the same thing? You are not a student? The incident -­",
  "I accept the word \"incident\" -­",
  "No, it isn't. I'm saying, for purposes -­",
  "Well, that might be also. What we're -- what we're saying -- I don't -- I'm accepting the word \"incident\" for the purposes of this case, that there is no question that the work that's being done, the services that are being performed, Justice Alito, are incident to the education. They are a part of the educational process. They are subservient to the educational process. In fact, they make the educational process. If I may, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice, may I reserve the balance of my time?",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. With respect to the question that Mr. Roberts was addressing with you, Justice Ginsburg, the record is very unclear. In the Eighth Circuit, residents may not be eligible for Social Security benefits. It's quite unclear in the other circuits. And I invite your attention -- and this is cited in the briefs -- to 20 C.F.R. 404.1028, which is a Social Security regulation. It says: \"If your main purpose is pursuing a course of study rather than earning a livelihood\" -- and it's unquestioned that that is what is happening here -- \"we consider you to be a student, and your work is not considered employment.\"",
  "Well, that may be what they do, and that may be dependent upon what happens with the FICA taxes, which is going to be determined -- which has been determined in four circuits as not being payable with respect to the residents' programs. The fact is that the government has taken a position for many, many years. Talk about deference for a moment, the National Muffler factors, which we understand still to be appropriate to evaluate deference given to an IRS regulation. This is not a contemporaneous regulation. It is something that came along just a couple of years ago. It's a result-oriented regulation. It's basically saying, we lost all these cases on the facts in the court of appeals, and now we will pronounce that we will win these cases, because we know all these residents programs involve more than -­",
  "Yes.",
  "This is very different, because it -- there's -- not because of any change in circumstances or facts. It isn't a clarification. It is a reversal. Because for all those years, the government said that we had this predominance test. If your goal is to pursue a course of study, you are a student. Now the government is saying, if your goal is to produce a course of study, but you do it for 41 hours a week, you are not a student. It is a -­",
  "Well, I -- this is up to the Court. The Court has never set aside National Muffler. The Court cited the National Muffler case in the Cottage Savings case, which is subsequent to Chevron. It cited Cottage Savings case in the Boeing case just a couple of years ago. You may tell me that the factors in National Muffler are no longer something that you would apply, but they're all sensible factors with respect to whether you would give deference to a regulation that pops up 65 years after the enactment of the statute, after the government has lost five cases on the facts which are directly relevant to the facts here, and it's a new regulation, and there has been no reliance.",
  "You don't need to get to the part 2, because we submit Chevron would apply and would stop you at step 1. Government -- the Congress addressed the factor at issue in this case. It said what students are: People who are regularly -- are enrolled and taking classes. To the extent that you get to the second phase, those factors seem to be appropriate to consider. If this is important, and if there is some anomaly out there, what the government should have done is turn to Congress, which enacted the regulation that described student and described what the limitations were. It had said nothing to do about a categorical limitation that if you're too much of a student, you're not a student. It is backwards. If there is some anomaly, and if the government wants to collect the funds from these programs that it has really never collected them from before, then it should turn to Congress. There has been no reliance and -- well, the intern -- the intern anomaly, one of the court of appeals that -- the court of appeals that considered that said it relies completely on non sequiturs. It relies for the interpretation of one statute with the repeal of another statute 45 years ago and draws inference from the legislative history with respect to that which -- the repeal took place 1 year after the St. Luke's case. The St. Luke's case, the Sixth Circuit decided that interns were not residents, residents were not interns.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress crafted a carefully balanced ERISA enforcement scheme that enables plan participants to recover plan benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B) and equitable remedies for ERISA violations under section 502(a)(3). In this case, Respondents are seeking a remedy for misleading plan summaries that violated ERISA. Their remedy, if they were harmed by defective plan summaries, is under 502(a)(3), equitable remedies, not for plan benefits under 502(a)(1)(B). The section that governs the relief that is sought is a necessary antecedent to any of the other questions in this case, and ERISA carefully structures, and this Court has repeatedly said the Court is not interested and does not -- is not willing to alter the structure that Congress carefully crafted and carefully developed over the years to provide remedies with respect to ERISA programs. And the scheme is such that, if there is a participant to the plan who is seeking benefits under that plan, section (a)(1)(B) of -- subsection (a)(1)(B) of section 502 provides for relief under the plan. If there are other violations of ERISA, section 502(a)(3) provides for equitable relief. That is the scheme carefully developed by Congress. Now, in this case what happened is that Cigna changed its pension program, its ERISA plan, from a defined benefit plan to a cash benefit plan, a cash value plan. And it put out, as required by ERISA, summaries of the new plan that the district court found, and the court of appeals affirmed, were misleading in -­ in the sense that they did not provide all of the information necessary for plan participants to evaluate what was happening. Now, the changes to the plan were lawful. ERISA permitted and does permit these kind of changes to an ERISA plan. There was nothing unlawful about the plan and the plan change. And the beneficiaries, the participants to the plan, did not have any choice. Cigna had the right to change the plan. It did change the plan. It did have an obligation under ERISA to provide accurate summaries, and the district court and the court of appeals found that those summaries were not inaccurate. In other words -- they were not accurate. In other words -­",
  "That is correct, Justice Ginsburg. They had no choice in the sense that Cigna could adopt a change in the plan, as it did. That was permitted under ERISA, but it was required to give accurate summaries. The choice that you're suggesting and the district court was concerned about is that an individual could have left the employ of Cigna if he or she was unhappy with the change in the plan, or the district court said there could have been some sort of a protest. What we're saying is that the remedy -­ what was -- what was the violation is the summary itself. And we're not -- we're not challenging that here. That's a finding below. The summary was misleading, but that makes it a violation of ERISA. The summary is not the plan. And -­",
  "It's quite clear from the structure of the statute that is correct, as you suggest, that there may be multiple instruments or documents that are the -- create the plan itself. But the summary plan document, the SPD, is not a part of the plan. It is a separate document. It is a summary. It is a succinct statement of what might be in the plan, and it must be accurate, and it must be written in comprehensible English. But I would refer the Court to section 1024 (b)(2) and (4), which are on pages 3a, 4a, and 5a of the blue brief. That describes the obligations that are required with respect to the summary plan document. And it describes the instruments of both the summary plan document and the instruments that constitute the plan itself in the following sentence -- and this is a similar sentence in subsection (4), but I'm reading from subsection (2), which is on 4a of the blue brief. It says: \"Summary plan\" -- it refers to \"a summary plan description and the latest annual report and\" -- or other -- \"and the bargaining agreement, trust agreement, contract, or other instruments under which the plan was established.\" The construction of that sentence has to be that the summary plan description is a separate document. It is not one of those latter category of documents under which the plan was established. And the proof of that, if -- if English doesn't teach it to us, which I think it does, is the reference to the annual report. No one would say and no one would contend that the annual report is a part of the instruments creating the plan.",
  "Well, the written instruments, as these things turn out, are long, complex documents. They may be 90, 100 pages long. The summary, as you suggest, Congress said, yes, there is a separate document that must state in intelligible English that plan participants can understand the following things, and they must be furnished to plan participants, but they are not the plan document. The way that ERISA is structured, it -­",
  "Well -- if the -- if the -­",
  "The plan can be more detailed than the SPD.",
  "Well, if the plan is -- if the SPD complies with ERISA, yes. It has to be -­",
  "Yes. Yes, exactly. But not everything that is in the plan, or the plan -- as the statute says, the documents that constitute the plan need not necessarily be in the summary. The words \"summary plan\" -­",
  "Well, I -- I submit that that is not the way the statute is written, and subsections (2) and (4) of the provision that I was referring to make that clear if the word \"summary\" itself did not make that clear. But the Curtiss-Wright case to which you referred to in your earlier question also proves that. Curtiss-Wright case talked about a summary plan description and said it can't modify the plan -­ using \"plan,\" \"summary plan description,\" in different terms -- it cannot modify the plan, which is what the district court here held, unless the plan specifically says that it may be modified in a certain way and that the summary is an appropriate amendment to the plan. So the Court -- and this was a unanimous decision of this Court -- was referring to the summary as something that was separate, that might modify the plan if the plan itself allows for it to be modified in that fashion. Now, the Government says that the summary plan description is a part of the plan and so do Respondents. And that's what the court below -- the court below didn't actually find that the SPD was a part of the plan. The court found, on the latter pages of its opinion, that it was a modification, it was an amendment to the plan. That's inconsistent with the Curtiss-Wright case because in this case the plan itself specifically says that it cannot -- does not say that it can be amended by the SPD.",
  "I think in the -- on page of the -- this is of -- this is the summary to the cert petition, page 218, which is the district court's -- the conclusions of the district court's decision. Under Roman numeral VIII, the district court specifically said that the terms of Part B have been correspondingly modified by the SPDs. The court was saying -- I think you were referring, Justice Ginsburg, to the relief that the court ordered, but the court was ordering that relief on the theory that the SPDs modified the plan. And the plan itself, under Curtiss-Wright, doesn't provide for it to be amended in that way. And the SPDs -­",
  "That's -­",
  "That's correct. And the SPDs, the two SPDs themselves, on page 922a and 938a of the Joint Appendix, specifically say that if there's any discrepancy between the SPD and the plan, the plan governs. The language is at the bottom of, for example, at the bottom of 922a. So -­",
  "That's correct. No one -- but Congress did consider prohibiting a provision like that in SPDs, that they could not disclaim, they could not say that if there's any inconsistency, the plan governed, and Congress did not adopt such a provision. This is a perfectly legal provision, to tell someone that if there's any discrepancy -- and there's bound to be discrepancies, the -- as I said, the plans themselves can be 90, 100 pages, very long and very complex. That's why there is an SPD that can't contain everything in the plan. And one of the things that would be the outcome of what the Government and Respondents are urging here is that plan creators, these companies that create these plans, either will be discouraged from doing it, or they will start preparing summaries that are 90 and 100 pages long so they -­",
  "That's Catch 22, because if there's a -- if there's a discrepancy because they have to be short, summary, and intelligible, then we have -­ we're faced with the proposition that someone's going to say, well, I read the SPD and it didn't say what was in the plan. If the SPD is as long and as detailed as the plan, then there's a violation of ERISA. My point I guess in this is that, yes, Justice Kagan, the statute requires the SPD to contain certain information. We accept the fact of the conclusions of the court below in this case that they did not do so. There are two SPDs. They failed to live up to the -- to the requirements of ERISA. There is a remedy for that. It is a violation of ERISA, and it specifically says in 502(a)(3) that for violations of ERISA, equitable remedies are available. And that is what Congress decided. It is -- unless it's a part of the plan, you must go under (a)(3).",
  "I would submit that it can't modify the plan unless the plan permits that. That's Curtiss-Wright. That's a unanimous decision of this Court.",
  "It seems to me -- I think we might disagree about that, respectfully. I think that the sense of the opinion in Curtiss-Wright was that if you're going to say that this SPD modifies the plan, it can only do so if the plan permits the SPD to modify the plan. Then the Court sent it back to a lower court to determine whether in fact the employees that were involved in creating the SPD there had the authority under the plan to modify the plan -- was it done -­",
  "That -­",

  "Well, in the first place, it is important which section that -­",
  "Okay. Okay. Because it's a different defendant. The plan is the defendant versus the plan administrator is the defendant. So that's important. Secondly, (a)(3) provides only for remedies that are available in equity. Then the point that you -- that you're making with respect to what provision of equity, what is the -- what is the action that's brought and what is the remedy sought, as this Court talked about in the Varity case, and so therefore those are those questions. Now, the Second Circuit said \"likely harmed.\" The fact is, as I pointed out at the very beginning, this was a lawful change in a plan and it's a plan where 27,000 people that were employees were participants in this plan and they would have had to do, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, either leave the company and suffer some harm or engage in some -­",

  "That's the -­",
  "Because --",
  "Well, in the first place, it comes out of the blue, \"likely harm,\" as I suggested, since this was a legal, lawful change. People were going to retain their employment. They didn't have a right to opt for one or the other. If they could prove that they were -- this is -­",
  "I -- that would not be justified at all. I mean, under equity, as this Court said in the Lyng v. Payne case, which is cited in the briefs, this is like an estoppel action. An essential element of an estoppel action is detrimental reliance on the adverse party's misrepresentation. What the district court below did was, by coming up with this \"likely harm\" harm thing, is throw the burden over to the plan or the plan administrator and saying: Demonstrate that any one of your -- all of your 27,000 members of this purported class somehow were hurt by a change in a plan over which they had no control, over which they had no discretion, unless they were going to leave the -­",

  "Well, Chief Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, that is the statute. The statute gives you relief with respect to a misleading plan summary under the laws of equity.

That's not realistic. And -- and that's why it just came out of -- out of thin air. If I may -­",

  "Well, (g), I'm talking about. That's what they -- I refer you to page 212 of the cert petition appendix under Roman numeral VI, where the district court specifically said: Plaintiffs also seek to assert their claim under ERISA's anti-cutback provision, 204(g). That claim has been rejected in the liability decision. That claim was raised; it was rejected in the liability decision. It's not here anymore. Section -- the real section that the Court should refer to in 204, is 204(h) -- (h)(6)(A) of ERISA, and I can't point to the portion of the appendix, but that was an addition by Congress in 2001 to deal with egregiously inaccurate notices of change. That -- and Congress amended ERISA in 2001, added that provision, and said, if there's an egregious violation of that provision, then you get all the benefits that you should have gotten. That's what Congress can do if it wishes to do. That's what's being sought in this case. Congress can take care of this if it wishes, but Congress enacted a carefully reticulated scheme; you're either suing for benefits under the plan or you're suing for violations of ERISA.",

And that's the evidence that would have to be established, and there's no -- and every court has said that under (a)(3) equity requires detrimental reliance.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner's commercial enterprise is precisely what Section 602(a)(1) was enacted to address, an international gray market in copyrighted works. This Court unanimously recognized in the Quality King case that 602(a)(1) encompasses copies of books that were lawfully made not under the United States' Copyright Act, but under the law of some other country. 602(a) is broader than 6 -- 109(a), because it encompasses copies not subject to the first-sale doctrine, for example copies made under the law of another country. These are the words of every member of this Court in the Quality King case. Now, referring to it as dicta misstates what was going on in the Quality King case. The argument was that if you interpret 602(a) and 109(a) as allowing a defense, a first-sale defense, you emasculate Section 602(a), and so the Court was explaining on page 147 and 148, I believe, why there were three reasons why 602(a) would have viability. And one of those reasons had to do with direct action against someone that was engaged in pirating, and some of it had to do with bailees and lessees. These are relatively small problems either otherwise dealt with by contract law or otherwise dealt with by the provisions of the statute. But the third reason for the Court's interpretation and its decision in that case was precisely the case that we're talking about here.",

  "But the -- but the two pro - - what I'm -- I guess what I'm trying to explain is that the two were enacted at the same time. They were out there and available to the public for 12 years before they were finally adopted. These parade of horribles could have been addressed by Congress in a different way at the time, and the interpretation -- this is a -- 109 is a defense -- is offered as a defense to section -- to section 602(a)(1). So what does it mean? What provide -- what is the defense that's provided? And you then have to interpret, \"made under this\" -- \"lawfully made under this title.\" What does that mean? And you have done that in the Quality King case. You explained in the Quality King unanimously that it makes a difference because you are exhausting - - Congress intended to allow segmentation of the market. It only makes sense to interpret this way if you allow segmentation of the market pursuant to these provisions, because it is exhausting the copyright under the laws of the United States once you make a sale of a product produced in the United States subject to the United States' copyright laws. You are not exhausting your U.S. copyright when you make something, or allow something to be made abroad. You are not exhausting that copyright. You have not done that yet. So the first sale is not something that happens abroad that uses up the copyright laws -- of the protection under the copyright laws of the United States. So it seems to me that this does make perfect sense. And it makes -- there is not going to be a perfect solution in every case. The Court has dealt with that frequently with respect to copyright laws. But if you interpret it as my opponent interprets it, you are opening the door to commercial enterprises precisely like this. It's not necessary in this case to decide every single permutation of a problem that someone crosses a border with a product, but this section 602 specifically contemplates products that are acquired abroad and then brought back into the United States. Here, we have a commercial enterprise doing exactly what is contemplated by the people who were talking about 602(a) and section 109 when the two were adopted at the same time.",
  "There are several answers to that. One, that's Congress's concern. And -- and there is no evidence that that would really actually happen. And Congress was concerned with creating a segmentation of the market. But it's entirely speculative as to whether or not people are going to start manufacturing books or other items outside the United States. Congress can address that if that should become a problem, but it's not something that was suggested as a part of what was taking place at that time.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I know that you will want me to spend a moment or two addressing the standing question, but before I do that, I thought that it would be important for this Court to have Proposition 8 put in context, what it does. It walls-off gay and lesbians from marriage, the most important relation in life, according to this Court, thus stigmatizing a class of Californians based upon their status and labeling their most cherished relationships as second-rate, different, unequal, and not okay.",
  "I was trying to avoid that, Your Honor.",
  "Yes. I think that our jurisdictional argument is, as we set forth in the brief, California cannot create Article III standing by designating whoever it wants to defend the State of California in connection with the ballot.",
  "That's the -- that's the way the California Supreme Court saw it with respect to California law. The governor and the Attorney General of California are elected to act in the best interests of the State of California. They made a professional judgment given their obligations as officers of the State of California. The California Supreme Court has said that proponents -- and by the way, only four of the five are here. Dr. Tam withdrew from the case because of some -- many things he said during the election -- campaign.",
  "I don't -- I don't think it's quite that limited. I think one of your colleagues suggested that there could be an officer appointed. There could be an appointee of the State of California who had responsibility, fiduciary responsibility to the State of California and the citizens of California, to represent the State of California along --",
  "Well, that happens all the time. As you recall in the case of -- well, let's not spend too much time on independent counsel provisions, but --",
  "The governor -- the government of the State of California frequently appoints an attorney where there's a perceived conflict of interest --",
  "-- and that person would have a responsibility for the State and might have responsibility for the attorneys' fees.",
  "There might well be in -- in a different case. I don't know about this case. If there was, for example, this was an initiative measure that allocated certain resources of the State of California and the people -- maybe it was a binary system of people got resources and other people didn't get resources, there could be standing. Someone would show actual injury. The point, I guess, at the bottom of this is the Supreme Court -- this Court, decided in Raines v. Byrd that Congress couldn't specify members of Congress in that context even where the measure depleted or diminished powers of Congress --",
  "The only -- that's exactly what the California Supreme Court thought. The California Supreme Court thought that it could decide that the proponents, whoever they were, and this could be 25 years after the election, it could be one of the proponents, it could be four of the proponents. They could have an interest other than the State because they have no fiduciary responsibility to the State. They may be incurring attorneys' fees on behalf of the State or on behalf of themselves, but they haven't been appointed. They have no official responsibility to the State. And my only argument, and I know it's a close one because California thinks that this is the system. The California Supreme Court thought that this was a system that would be a default system. I'm suggesting from your decisions with respect to Article III that that takes more than that under --",
  "I don't have an answer to that question unless there's an appointment process either built into the system where it's an officer of California or --",
  "And that's the argument --",
  "That's our -- that's the argument our opponents make. But it -- but it must be said that it happens all of the time. That Federal officials and State officials decide not to enforce a statute, to enforce a statute in certain ways. We don't then come in and decide that there's someone else ought to be in court for every particular --",
  "Yeah, I don't --",
  "It is -- what is missing here because you're not an officer of the State of California. You don't have a fiduciary duty to the State of California. You're not bound by the ethical standards of an officer of the State of California to represent the State of California. You could have conflicts of interest. And as I said, you'd be -- could be incurring enormous legal fees, on behalf of the State, when the State hasn't decided to go that route. I think --",
  "Thank you, Your Honor. As I pointed out at the -- at the outset, this is a measure that walls off the institution of marriage, which is not society's right. It's an individual right that this Court again and again and again has said the right to get married, the right to have the relationship of marriage is a personal right. It's a part of the right of privacy, association, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In the cases in which you've described the right to get married under the Constitution, you've described it as marriage, procreation, family, other things like that. So the procreation aspect, the responsibility or ability or interest in procreation is not a part of the right to get married. Now, that --",
  "Well, there's a couple of answers to that, it seems to me, Mr. Chief Justice. In this case, that decision to exclude gays and lesbians was made by the State of California.",
  "That's right.",
  "The California Supreme Court, like this Supreme Court, decides what the law is. The California Supreme Court decided that the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of that California Constitution did not permit excluding gays and lesbians from the right to get married --",
  "When -- may I answer this in the form of a rhetorical question? When did it become unconstitutional to prohibit interracial marriages? When did it become unconstitutional to assign children to separate schools?",
  "When the -- when the California Supreme Court faced the decision, which it had never faced before, is -- does excluding gay and lesbian citizens, who are a class based upon their status as homosexuals -- is it -- is it constitutional --",
  "That -- they did not assign a date to it, Justice Scalia, as you know. What the court decided was the case that came before it --",
  "Yes.",
  "It was constitutional when we -- as a culture determined that sexual orientation is a characteristic of individuals that they cannot control, and that that --",
  "There's no specific date in time. This is an evolutionary cycle.",
  "Because the case that's before you --",
  "-- in -- the case that's before you today, California decided -- the citizens of California decided, after the California Supreme Court decided that individuals had a right to get married irrespective of their sexual orientation in California and then the Californians decided in Proposition 8, wait a minute, we don't want those people to be able to get married.",
  "I would make -- I would make the -- also would make the -- that distinguishes it in one respect. But what also -- also -- I would also make the argument, Mr. Chief Justice, that we are -- this -- marriage is a fundamental right and we are making a classification based upon a status of individuals, which this Court has repeatedly decided that gays and lesbians are defined by their status. There is no question about that.",
  "We do, we submit that. You could write a narrower decision.",
  "I don't -- when -- it seems to me, Justice Scalia, that --",
  "I -- I submit you've never required that before. When you decided that -- that individuals -- after having decided that separate but equal schools were permissible, a decision by this Court, when you decided that that was unconstitutional, when did that become unconstitutional?",
  "I -- I can't answer that question and I don't think this Court has ever phrased the question in that way.",
  "But what I have before you now, the case that's before you today is whether or not California can take a class of individuals based upon their characteristics, their distinguishing characteristics, remove from them the right of privacy, liberty, association, spirituality, and identity that -- that marriage gives them. It -- it is -- it is not an answer to say procreation or anything of that nature because procreation is not a part of the right to get married.",
  "This Court has always looked into the context. In, for example, the New Orleans case involving the gambling casinos and advertising, you look at the context of what was permitted, what was not permitted, and does that rationalization for prohibiting in that case the advertising, in this case prohibiting the relationship of marriage, does it make any sense in the context of what exists?",
  "No, I don't think it would come out differently because of the fundamental arguments we're making with respect to class-based distinctions with respect to a fundamental right. However, to the extent that my opponent in the context of California, talks about child-rearing or adoptions or -- or of rights of people to live together and that sort of thing, those arguments can't be made on behalf of California because California's already made a decision that gay and lesbian individuals are perfectly suitable as parents, they're perfectly suitable to adopt, they're raising 37,000 children in California, and the expert on the other side specifically said and testified that they would be better off when their parents were allowed to get married.",
  "I -- I think that it's not that we're arguing that those are inconsistent. If the -- if the fundamental thing is that denying gays and lesbians the right of marriage, which is fundamental under your decisions, that is unconstitutional. If it is -- if the State comes forth with certain arguments -- Utah might come forth with certain justifications. California might come forth with others. But the fact is that California can't make the arguments about adoption or child-rearing or people living together because they have already made policy decisions. So that doesn't make them inconsistent.",
  "The label is like --",
  "The label \"marriage\" means something. Even our opponents --",
  "It is like you were to say you can vote, you can travel, but you may not be a citizen. There are certain labels in this country that are very, very critical. You could have said in the Loving case, what -- you can't get married, but you can have an interracial union. Everyone would know that that was wrong. That the -- marriage has a status, recognition, support, and you -- if you read the test -- you know - -",
  "But you have said that marriage is a fundamental right with respect to procreation and at the same level getting married, privacy -- you said that in the Zablocki case, you said that in the Lawrence case, and you said it in other cases, the Skinner case, for example. Marriage is put on a pro -- equal footing with procreational aspects. And your -- this Court is the one that has said over and over again that marriage means something to the individual. The privacy, intimacy, and that it is a matter of status and recognition in this --",
  "Well, you've said -- you've said in the cases decided by this Court that the polygamy issue, multiple marriages raises questions about exploitation, abuse, patriarchy, issues with respect to taxes, inheritance, child custody, it is an entirely different thing. And if you -- if a State prohibits polygamy, it's prohibiting conduct. If it prohibits gay and lesbian citizens from getting married, it is prohibiting their exercise of a right based upon their status. It's selecting them as a class, as you described in the Romer case and as you described in the Lawrence case and in other cases, you're picking out a group of individuals to deny them the freedom that you've said is fundamental, important, and vital in this society, and it has status and stature, as you pointed out in the VMI case. There's a -- there's a different --",
  "Yes, the Ninth Circuit did that. You can decide the standing case that limits it to the decision of the district court here. You could decide it as the Ninth Circuit did --",
  "Oh, the case was certainly properly granted, Your Honor. I mean, there was a full trial of all of these issues. There was a 12-day trial. The judge insisted on evidence on all of these questions. This -- this is a --",
  "The issue -- yes, the Ninth Circuit looked at it and decided because of your decision on the Romer case -- this Court's decision on the Romer case, that it could be decided on the narrower issue, but it certainly was an appropriate case to grant. And those issues that I've been describing are certainly fundamental to the case. And -- and I don't want to abuse the Court's indulgence, that what I -- you suggested that this is uncharted waters. It was uncharted waters when this Court, in 1967, in the Loving decision said that interracial -- prohibitions on interracial marriages, which still existed in 16 States, were unconstitutional.",
  "And -- and what we have here --",
  "I -- I respectfully submit that we've under -- we've learned to understand more about sexual orientation and what it means to individuals. I guess the -- the language that Justice Ginsburg used at the closing of the VMI case is an important thing, it resonates with me, \"A prime part of the history of our Constitution is the story of the extension of constitutional rights to people once ignored or excluded.\"",
  "Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to start with something that Mr. Kneedler has been talking about. He referred to the House Report three or four times during his argument today, and he referred to it six times in his brief. He did not mention Page 23, the top of which says, \"This bill, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, does not attempt to deal with questions of discovery. Existing law appears to be adequate in this area, for example...\" And then there are privileges that could be raised. That is a piece of the legislative history that the United States apparently has forgotten completely about. Secondly, the United States has said that there's a common law backdrop to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act dealing with discovery in aid of execution, yet this Court, four years ago in the Samantar case says indisputably the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act displaces the common law.",
  "Yes, Justice Ginsburg. This case is not about execution. This case is about finding out information ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "But, 69(a)(2), as one of your colleagues pointed out, is the discovery in aid of execution. It provides the right to obtain information with respect to that ­­ that might be under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which were not displaced by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, and all we're talking about here is information ­­ I should start with the fact that this ­­ the context of this case is that Argentina was able to sell bonds and to raise money in the United States, on the capital markets of the United States, only by agreeing to be bound by U.S. law, to be sued in and subject to the judgments of U.S. courts, and by waiving sovereign immunity and consenting to attachment in aid of execution. And there's even a reference in that waiver, which was drafted for Argentina by sophisticated New York counsel, in order to obtain money in the United States had ­­ had Argentina said, and we won't pay the judgments, we won't obey the orders of the United States courts, we will resist discovery when we spirit money outside of the United States, we will do all of those things, it would never have been able to borrow any money in the United States.",
  "Because exactly, Mr. Chief Justice, that's the context of why my clients are attempting to seek information with respect to where Argentina has moved its assets, the lower courts, the district court­­",
  "Yes. And in every instance when someone is attempting to execute on a judgment to pay ­­ there is no question it was jurisdiction of the Court to issue the judgments, the judgments are valid and binding. Now the ­­ the creditors are attempting to find out where the assets are, there's a history in this case, and it could be in any other case. That's why it's a question of general application, every creditor, judgment creditor is looking for the assets of the judgment debtor and many judgment debtors move those assets around in order to avoid having to pay the judgment.",
  "Well, there's several answers to that. First of all, Section 1606 of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which is not mentioned in the government's brief at all and the government specifically takes the district judge to task for treating Argentina like a private litigant, Section 1606 says if jurisdiction is established, the foreign state shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances. So the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act specifically said that once jurisdiction is established, and was not unquestionably established here, Argentina is to be treated to the same manner and to the same extent as a private litigant.",
  "That's exactly correct, Justice Ginsburg. And when it comes time to execute on property identified by Argentina ­­ it's actually ­­ the discovery is not addressed to Argentina. It is addressed to third­party banks.",
  "We believe that it could be addressed to Argentina, no question. But this particular case comes to you where the discovery is addressed to non­sovereigns who have not appealed and who are complying with the order pursuant to what the District Court did.",
  "Pardon me, Your Honor?",
  "One of the parties objected to the subpoena. There were objections going back and forth. There was a narrowing of the scope of the subpoena. The subpoenas themselves may be found ­­ and it's not for all of the terrible things that my colleague has mentioned, they are on the Joint Appendix of 54 and 55 and 91.",
  "It's asking for bank transactions, Justice Sotomayor. And the reason for that is, we do not know, and Argentina has provided plenty of reason for us to be suspicious, as to where property is, how it's denominated, what it's being used for. If it is a piece of commercial ­­ if it's an airline that says Argentine Air Force on the side of it, it still could be commercial property. We need to know what those assets are. The purpose for discovery is to find what the assets are, where they are, what they're being used for, where they moved, when they moved. And that's why the bank subpoenas, which the banks are complying with and the banks have not objected to and the banks are not sovereigns, notwithstanding my colleague has now said not in the lower courts, but in this Court, that BNA, one of the banks is a sovereign, but it has not claimed sovereign immunity and it has not appeared here.",
  "I just ­­ the answer would be that if you don't know what Argentina is doing with the property and what labels it's slapping on the property ­­",
  "It is ­­ well, we don't know what its purpose is until we find out what the assets are.",
  "Yes, the answer is yes. And there's a reason for it.",
  "Well, what ­­ this subpoena relates to bank transactions. If there­­ and as the legislative history that I referred to ­­",
  "That's what the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide, that ­­",
  "I understand.",
  "Well, and part of the answer is in the Altmann decision itself where you specifically said the views of the United States with respect to the construction of a statute of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, are not entitled to deference. If there is objection by the State Department with respect to a particular interest, a particular party, a particular situation, it can set that forth. Instead, what the United States has done is filed a brief with respect to the construction of the statute. And the other answer, Justice Breyer, is specifically set out, if there are objections of that nature, diplomatic objections, sovereignty objections with respect to a particular official, again the legislative history, and I know this may not be persuasive to everyone here, but it's something that the United States referred to as persuasive in its brief, this Court found it persuasive in part in the Samantar case four years ago. It specifically says if there are those kind of objections, they are addressed to the District Court, and the District Court can address them and subject to an abuse of discretion standard. So it's all right here. It's what Congress was intending.",
  "Yes. Because what you're seeking is information about the assets. You are not executing on the asset. And if the United States law said that that would be extraterritorial application, if it said you can't ­­ we're going to inhibit your ability to accomplish an execution or an attachment but is pursuant to the laws of a foreign country, pursuant to decisions of a foreign tribunal, that would be the extraterritorial application.",
  "No, no. That's the purpose of discovery, Justice Scalia, so that the judgment creditor can find out what the assets are, and then it ­­ it can go to the courts of this country or the courts of another country and to comply ­­",
  "Probably under­­ diplomatic assets are covered by a separate convention, as we mentioned in our brief. Diplomatic assets and consulate affairs ­­",
  "Military assets. Even Section 1611 of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act only exempts certain military aspects ­­ military property. It has to be being used for military purpose and so forth. So if you find out something that isn't within the scope of that exemption, then you can execute on it even in this country.",
  "The problem, Justice Scalia, as any litigant knows, you don't know what the judgment debtor is doing with its assets. You don't know whether it's disguising its assets. You don't know ­­",
  "The answer to that is, to the extent that there's a specific objection with respect to a scope ­­ the scope of the discovery, it can be addressed by the district court as opposed to a blanket prohibition on finding out information with respect to a judgment debtor who has ­­",
  "I think what you should say to the DISTRICT court is what the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which were not replaced by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, do. If it's relevant to the subject matter or a defense of the action, as under ­­ pursuant to Rule 69(a)(2) and Rule 26, then it's something that there may be specific objections or specific concerns, but the Federal Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act did not replace the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It didn't intend ­­",
  "It says the discovery rule, Rule 69(a)(2) says the ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "And I think that with respect to that, that provision, those statements of the Advisory Committee have to take ­­ be taken in the context that the statute itself did not intend to address discovery that's quite clear. Section 69(a)(2) specifically says as provided in these rules or by the procedure of the state in which the court is located. As the Second Circuit specifically said, the rules in ­­ the laws in the State of New York and the rules in ­­ and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, discovery in aid of execution is very broad and it may go to any person, and if you meet the relevant standard anywhere the property may be located.",
  "Well, you assume the answer in the question that you asked, Justice Scalia. We don't know whether it's properly subject to a homestead until we find out how many homes, where they are, who owns them, what they're being used for. The rules are that then you can ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "I submit ­­",
  "I submit that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure would allow a judgment creditor to ask the bank or other persons or even the judgment debtor, what homes do you own, yes.",
  "No.",
  "You could levy on those homes in Florida if Florida allows you to do so, yes. You can take that judgment in New York and go to Florida and seek the enforcement or execution of that judgment. This is the ­­",
  "Yes. It's a judgment for money due. You borrowed money, you didn't pay it back, and you have a judgment that entitles you to recover that money.",
  "Well, if that's your hypothetical, that the judgment exempts homesteads, I don't know whether the ­­ whether ­­ that gets pretty far afield here. We're talking ­­",
  "A judgment creditor who has a bond in New York City and has ­­ and the debtor refuses to pay it and gets a judgment from a court which has jurisdiction, then can take that judgment and go to other places where there is property located and execute or attach on that property depending upon the laws ­­",
  "­­ of that jurisdiction.",
  "This Court ­­ I think it's the Société Nationale case ­­ has said that a court can order discovery even with respect to where the person to whom the discovery is addressed says I can't give you that information. The case that your Court decided involved Mexico, and the party claimed that, the laws of Mexico will not let me provide that information. This Court held that, yes, indeed the courts of the United States may require the production of that information. I think it's ­­",
  "Exactly.",
  "Well, that's ­­ you are talking about an abuse of discretion standard, and when you talk about airplanes that may they be used for commercial purposes, this Court has held ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "In this country, I think the ­­",
  "The district court went through an elaborate process. It narrowed the scope of the subpoenas with respect to property in Argentina. It narrowed the scope of the subpoenas with respect to the persons identified in the subpoenas. It responded to concerns about that. It made itself available to narrowing the scope of things. Argentina decided to make a blanket objection to any information other than information with respect to ­­",
  "­­ assets that could be levied on in the United States, and that we think is not the correct interpretation of the FSIA or the Federal Rules.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's correct, Your Honor.",
  "Exactly. And if I haven't said that ­­",
  "To the extent­­ Exactly. I think I understand completely your question. My answer is precisely the ability to attach or levy is dependent upon the law where the place the property is located and there are many jurisdictions that cover different things and we're dealing with judgment debtors, which is ­­ and it's true across the board, Justice Scalia. The judgment debtors may be doing all sorts of things to avoid execution or avoid paying their debts. In this case we have specific findings by the courts below that Argentina has ample resources to pay these debts. It submitted to jurisdiction. It specifically stated that it will not obey the orders of the courts of the United States, including presumably any decision from this Court.",
  "I'm ­­",
  "Yes, because anybody who has ever litigated against Argentina knows that it probably may be less costly to just give in on whatever terms Argentina offers. But the fact is that these are debts undeniably due and owing, sovereign immunity was waived, and I must emphasize the provision about the waiver provisions which are in sections ­­ joint appendix 106 and 107, are as broad as the law allows, and they waive immunity from suit, they consent to suit, they waived the Sovereign Immunities Act and even at the last few lines of the waiver it specifically talks about execution in foreign countries.",
  "Yes, I believe that's the case, Your Honor. Discovery is a continuing process, although substantially the discovery demands have been met so far, but it's a continuing process. There ­­ there can be objections before with respect to, wait a minute, that's our ambassador. Of course other laws cover that sort of thing, and the judge was very careful about that sort of thing.",
  "I think the judge might ask for some assurances that, from Argentina, that you are telling the truth this time, that that's ­­ these are really military assets and not something disguised as military assets.",
  "The waiver extends as far as the law will permit, and we submit that ­­",
  "No. The waiver ­­",
  "It waives the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act defenses. It waives immunity from ­­",
  "The waiver extends to anything that ­­ Argentina has decided that in order to borrow money in this country it had the sovereign right to waive sovereign immunity under the laws of the United States.",
  "I believe that it does, Justice Kennedy, because if you ­­ if you construed the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of prohibiting a foreign sovereign from waiving its immunity, you would cripple a foreign sovereign from deciding that, I need to borrow money and in order to borrow money ­­",
  "I think it depends upon the circumstances, but there is a separate treaty that covers consular affairs that is different than this, that does provide immunity. And we're not talking about any of those things. We're talking about bank transactions which are covered by the subpoena to allow a judgment creditor that has a judgment over Argentina, and Argentina is not asking to be treated like a private citizen as the law requires.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Mr. Lamken's entire case is summed up by the one single pending case. I counted over 25 times that that phrase appeared in Petitioner's brief. Now I hear today that it's not one case; it's ­­ it could be multiple cases. It's a particular outcome. It's a particular property. What Congress did in Section 8772 is act pursuant to its core constitutional authority by legislating changes in substantive laws. And Petitioner admits multiple times in its brief, at page 26, 27, 52, 53, and reply brief pages 3, 5, 18, that substantive law was changed in this case. And the substantive law that was changed by Congress respected the execution of assets of a foreign sovereign judgment debtor. The judiciary determined in 19 cases that there was liability in ­­ in these cases by clear and convincing evidence that Iran sponsored terrorist acts ­­",
  "Yes, it does.",
  "Yes, it is a separate matter. But my point is ­­ and the ­­ the cases that are involved in this litigation are at pages 2a and 2b of the red brief appendix. There were 19 cases in which liability was determined, damages were determined, and then consolidated for the purpose of ­­",
  "Yes, Your Honor. And I think this is the Plaut case to which Justice Scalia ­­",
  "The legislation in the Plaut case involved specific pending pieces of litigation, some of which had not been reduced to a judgment; some of them had been reduced to a judgment, but that judgment had not been final in the sense that the appeals were not exhausted; and one case in which the appeals had been exhausted, and that judgment was final. This Court found that that violated the separation of powers, but that the change of the statute of limitations and the opinion for the Court in that case by Justice Scalia points out specifically that Congress can legislate to change an element of a cause of action, to change a rule of evidence that's an impediment to the plaintiff recovering, and can change the statute of limitations. And in footnote 9 of that case, the Court points out there's nothing ­­ there's no problem with particularized ­­",
  "Yes. In my view. And my opponent does not dispute the fact that Congress can change the rule of decision by changing the substantive law while a case is pending. The courts have the obligation to apply ­­ this goes back to the Schooner Peggy case in 1801.",
  "Yes. May I answer?",
  "Yes. And we point that out in the brief that there ­­ to the extent that there are violations of individual rights, the bill of ­­ the framers of the Constitution put provisions in the Constitution to deal with that kind of situation, Ex Post Facto Clause, the Bill of Attainder Clause, the Due Process Clause, which incorporates principles of equal protection for the Federal government.",
  "I think that comes somewhat closer to the Klein case, where the Court was talking about an ­­ an area where the Supreme Court, this Court, in ­­ in the McCardle case and the other case that's mentioned in that ­­ in that decision, where the ­­ where Congress was directing a result that was inconsistent with decisions that this Court had already made with respect to the pardon power. So ­­",
  "In ­­ in pending cases, that would be much like the Robertson case where there were two pending cases involving property ­­",
  "I'm saying that it's okay ­­ I ­­ I ­­ I believe it's okay, under the circumstances, because what the ­­ this Court said in Robertson in a unanimous opinion was that that ­­ that that type of legislation is, to the extent it is changing the underlying substantive law, that is permissible. Congress may do that. Now, the ­­",
  "Well, what I think the ­­ your ­­ your hypothetical included two components. One where the Congress of the United States passed a statute saying that hereinafter this particular law will be interpreted in this particular way. That is a change in the substantive law which, in the Miller case ­­",
  "Then ­­",
  "Well ­­",
  "Unfortunately, I guess, I know some might say that Congress does that all the time, by providing authority in administrative officials to interpret the statute. And then this Court, under various different provisions that you've decided, say that we will accord deference to that ­­ under various circumstances ­­",
  "I ­­ if ­­",
  "I ­­ I ­­ I believe that as long as that case is pending and is not final, allow the Plaut case. And the statute of limitations, we don't like ­­ Congress doesn't like the interpretation or the application of a particular statute of limitations; Congress can say we're changing the statute of limitations, in a sense, by saying just as you said.",
  "Well, I think that you now moved it further, to the point where the Congress is directing, with respect to a particular case, the outcome between A and B. But to the extent ­­ and this is Robertson. So the ­­ and ­­ and that argument was made, and that argument was sort of adopted in the Ninth Circuit. But this Court unanimously reversed the Ninth Circuit in that case. The same ­­ essentially the same argument was made ­­ if you look at the briefs and look at the Robertson decision, the same argument was made there that was being made here. And ­­",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, I do. I ­­ I respectfully feel that there are many differences. Here, what Congress did ­­ and my opponent concedes that the substantive law of foreign sovereign immunity from execution was changed substantively. And what you said in the Miller case and ­­ and repeating what was said in the Robertson and the Plaut case, is that if the substantive law is being changed, there's no problem under Klein. There's not a separation of ­­ separation of powers problem. And so to the extent that ­­ and I agree with you, that this system that we have wouldn't tolerate Congress directing an outcome of a specific case: A must win and B must lose. And there might be implications with respect to the Due Process Clause, the Bill of Attainder Clause, if ­­ if it would involve some sort of punishment, or ex post facto issues in ­­ in ­­ in the criminal context.",
  "The ­­",
  "Yes. So to the extent that the ­­",
  "The Federal Constitution imports equal protection principles in the Due Process Clause; that is correct. But what we have here, we have multiple cases where the judicial function was, first of all, to decide liability in individual cases. And liability was determined by clear and convincing evidence that the government of Iran sponsored terrorism that killed and maimed American citizens. And then there was a decision by the judiciary in 19 different cases that there were damages to be awarded.",
  "That presents more significant difficulties that are closer to the line that the Chief Justice is pursuing ­­",
  "To the extent ­­ to the extent that this is Robertson, to the extent that that court can interpret that under these circumstances, the law, with respect to attaching the trusts or commingling of assets, will be thus. And that's the interpretation that this Court or another court can give to it.",
  "The line of directing an outcome in a particular case with respect ­­ and this is Klein, where the Supreme Court was directing the outcome, the interpretation ­­ where Congress was directing the interpretation of the meaning and significance given to a pardon where the court had already decided in a final decision what the outcome of that case ­­",
  "Well, I ­­ and I think there is no not deciding for particular case principle embedded in the separation of powers concept. There is an instruction to the judiciary to decide a case a certain way that the Court talked about in the Plaut case, but that is not involved. And the Court in Plaut in that footnote to which I referred said that there is no constitutional impediment to Congress legislating for a class of ­­",
  "Yes. And that's ­­ I think the government will address that in more detail. But we did discuss in our brief that the power of the President and ­­ this is ­­ this is the power of the President and Congress working together. Congress passed the statute. The President signed the statute. The President blocked the assets. By the way, these assets are in the United States illegally. There's already been fines imposed with respect to the laundering of these funds that put them in the United States. This is a case involving the execution of assets of a foreign sovereign in the United States who could hardly imagine a case where the power of the executive and Congress working together with respect to foreign policy and terrorism have.",
  "I think that there is probably a point where if the Congress is directing the court to decide a case a certain way, irrespective ­­ and what you said in the Miller case ­­",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, what you said in Miller, quoting the Robertson case and quoting the Plaut case, is whatever the precise scope of Klein ­­ because I think that's what you're referring to ­­ later decisions have made clear that its prohibition does not take hold when Congress amends applicable law.",
  "Well ­­ and yes. That would also implicate due process and possibly a takings and other ­­",
  "I think that unless the Court feels that what Congress is really doing is changing the underlying statute, the substantive provision that ordains that result ­­",
  "I agree with you, but ­­",
  "Agree that that would implicate concerns about separation of power, just directing a judgment. But to the extent ­­",
  "Yes. Because in the Plaut case the Court talks about the fact that Congress can enact legislation and it ­­ is it some case or is it ­­",
  "You have ­­ in order to win, you have to have a statute of limitations that comes out this way. And we are legislating with respect to these set ­­ this set of circumstances that the statute of limitations will be different, and that is Plaut case and ­­",
  "Well, Congress has made a determination by using its power to change something that will affect the outcome of a case. Every time Congress passes a statute, it affects the outcome of future cases and pending cases. The Schooner Peggy said that Congress may do that, and that had to do with the Treaty, in connection with the pending case. And until that case is final, Congress can change the substantive law. And if that is the import of Justice Kagan's question, which I take it to be, that is within Congress's power. There's no limiting principle. We heard it today. The single pending case was ­­ that was mentioned 25 times in Petitioner's brief went out the window. Now it can be, well, two cases, nine cases, seven cases. What is the limiting principle here? There are limiting principles in the Constitution, specific provisions. But we're talking about separation of powers. And what this Court has said repeatedly is if the legislation can be interpreted as changing the underlying substantive law, that is not ­­ whether it's particularized or not and even if it's a legitimate class of one, as that footnote in the Plaut case says. And there have been private bills ­­",
  "What is ­­ what is, Justice Scalia, something like this, as ­­ as you did point out in that footnote in the Plaut case, there have been individual pieces of legislation, special bills throughout the Court's history. There have been changes in the copyright laws that are ­­ benefitted particular copyright holders or patent holders, or Indian ­­ claims to Indian tribes and so forth. There is particularized ­­",
  "Well, if you're ­­",
  "Yeah. I ­­ what I would say, Your Honor, is that Congress does all the time with respect to particularized legislation favoring a particular individual or not favoring a particular individual. And it can't be a constitutional principle that if you put a case name in ­­ in the change of the law, all of a sudden it becomes unconstitutional. Or you could do it today but you can't do it tomorrow because someone filed a lawsuit."
