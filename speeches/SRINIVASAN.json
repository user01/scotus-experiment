  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is whether Pennsylvania's imposition of a default sentence of life imprisonment by operation of law when the jury in a capital sentencing proceeding is unable to reach a unanimous verdict constitutes an acquittal within the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause. We think the answer to that question lies in the settled rule that a hung jury is not an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes. Double jeopardy law has always drawn a clear distinction between hung juries, where the jury fails to reach a resolution of the case, and acquittals, where a unanimous jury makes a factual determination that the facts in evidence fail to establish the defendant's guilt, or in this --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, we think there is a distinction between those two. In the hypothetical statute that you posit, if the jury's resolution in favor of a life sentence were not considered to have final effect, that would strike at the heart of a value central to the Double Jeopardy Clause in that the State could then continue to reprosecute the defendant repeatedly, so we think that in that hypothetical statute, when the jury comes back for a life sentence, I don't know if it's fair to call it an acquittal because an acquittal has a settled meaning under the Double Jeopardy Clause, but we think that determination would be accorded finality for double jeopardy purposes. But this case is different in a significant respect. Here, Pennsylvania gave the defendant the same opportunity to obtain a final acquittal in his favor that defendants traditionally enjoy on the underlying question of guilt or innocence, and that is that he could have obtained a unanimous verdict in his favor, and we think that distinction is critical for double jeopardy purposes.",
  "Justice Souter, it's true that the sentencing proceeding in this case culminated ultimately in the entry of a judgment, but the fact of a judgment we think is not dispositive for double jeopardy purposes, and that's because the core premise of the clean slate rule is that the entry of a sentencing judgment is not a double jeopardy disposition that bars the State from resentencing in the event of a retrial. It's not the event of a judgment that makes the difference. It's whether that judgment manifests the qualities of an acquittal. That's what Bullington holds. So the question is whether the entry of a life sentence in this case manifests the quality of a factual acquittal, and we think it does not, because a hung jury has never been thought to constitute an acquittal within the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause.",
  "I don't think so, Justice Kennedy, because the State can resentence in the event of a retrial. It's true that the State has decided that it won't appeal, but the operation of the clean slate rule works such that when the defendant occasions a retrial by successfully appealing his conviction and sentence, at that point the State is free to conduct a resentencing and impose a harsher sentence.",
  "If -- I'm sorry.",
  "That's correct, but -- of course that's correct, Justice Breyer, but I think the reason we should win is because the judgment that was entered in this case is not a factual acquittal of the nature that was considered --",
  "Well, I think in that case -- it would depend on how the jury were instructed.",
  "No, I think if the jury is required to make a unanimous verdict in either direction, and the judge imposes a sentence of life imprisonment because the jury has made a unanimous verdict, that would have --",
  "Well, I think in that situation it would present some of the same difficulties that I was discussing in reference to Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical in that it's unclear whether the defendant would have --",
  "Right, and if the judge articulated it in his judgment in a way that distinguished between a judgment of a life sentence based on a unanimous jury verdict and judgment of a life sentence based on --",
  "Well, I think in that situation we'd have the same answer that we would to Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, which is that because the defendant has not been afforded an opportunity to obtain finality, then the double jeopardy law would treat that judgment as final, and the State would not be permitted in that situation to revisit the sentencing judgment. But this case is different in a significant respect, because here, Pennsylvania law draws a distinction between a unanimous jury verdict and a hung jury that results in the imposition of a life sentence, and petitioner had the opportunity to obtain a unanimous jury verdict, and, in fact, when the jury initially past its note to the judge indicating that it had reached an impasse, petitioner immediately moved for declaration of a mistrial and discharge of the jury. And in that situation it's clear under double jeopardy law that when the defendant invites the declaration of a mistrial and the discharge of a jury, there's no double jeopardy prohibition against the State's conducting a retrial or, in this case, the State's conducting a new sentencing proceeding.",
  "Justice Souter, because it depends on whether State law makes unanimity the deciding criterion. If State law does --",
  "Our position is that if a State has a unanimity requirement, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not preclude the State from enforcing that unanimity requirement, but if a State draws no distinction between a unanimous jury verdict of acquittal and a one-juror vote for the life sentence, then the Double Jeopardy Clause requires the State to honor the finality of the judgment in favor of a defendant. That's our position in this case.",
  "Justice Breyer, we think the due process question in terms of undue burden was -- was --",
  "It's -- I think it's fair to say that it's a factor, but I think it's important to note that there are important reasons why a State would draw the distinction drawn by Pennsylvania in this case. There are three reasons why a State might choose not to conduct a resentencing in the initial round of proceedings, but nonetheless to resentence in the event of a retrial. First, as an interesting closure, the State might determine that after a capital trial and a capital sentencing hearing, at that point, it makes sense to accept what is still a substantial punishment, the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment, but if the defendant occasions a new trial by successfully appealing his conviction, at that point the balance of considerations changes. And in particular, in terms of the second reason, if a State were to conduct a new sentencing proceeding immediately after a hung jury in the initial round of proceedings, the sentencing jury would come to the new sentencing proceeding without having had the benefit of standing through -- of sitting through the capital trial, and the State might reasonably conclude that at that point, it would have to retry much of the underlying case on guilt or innocence. By contrast, when the defendant occasions a new trial by successfully appealing his conviction, the State will have selected a capital jury to conduct the trial, and the new capital jury will come to the sentencing proceeding entirely familiar with the facts and circumstances of the case.",
  "Justice O'Connor, the -- the Solicitor General's Office today, as before, believes that in the majority of the cases, in the overwhelming majority of the cases, claims asserting ineffective assistance of counsel will be better resolved on collateral review. The question has been whether the costs of applying a procedural default rule outweigh those benefits, and it has been our experience, with the application of the rule in the Second and Seventh Circuits over the past several years, that the administrative costs that initially were feared haven't -- haven't been borne out, and that the degree of uncertainty that initially led us to -- to reach the position that a procedural default rule should not be applied hasn't been borne out either.",
  "In the main, we think that's correct, Justice O'Connor. It should not -- the rule's operation should not result in unfairness to defendants, and should not overload the courts with ineffectiveness claims that are asserted prematurely on direct appeal.",
  "Justice Souter, the best that we can tell, and this is based on essentially anecdotal reports of U.S. Attorney's Offices, it's somewhere on the order of 20 to 40 percent, roughly, of cases in which new counsel represents the defendant on appeal, but that -- I'd -- I hesitate to rely too much on that figure, because it is based on the anecdotal reports --",
  "-- and additionally, it varies significantly by locality, depending on the particular rules that are in place for replacement of counsel on appeal.",
  "This issue?",
  "We don't -- we don't have the figures on that. We don't -- we don't track the figures by substantive claims, and so it's been difficult to come up with numbers that reflect the treatment of ineffectiveness claims in particular.",
  "It's -- it's hard to say because there's no hard scientific data, and I --",
  "No, we haven't been conducting an examination of that, of that sort, of course.",
  "That -- Justice Breyer, it's correct that it saves time at the stage of collateral review, but the question for procedural default purposes is the effect of the rule at the time of direct appeal, and --",
  "But the consequences of having a procedural default rule is that it encourages the raising of ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal in any essential issues.",
  "Justice Breyer, there are situations in which ineffectiveness claims can be raised and resolved on direct appeal, and --",
  "It is a narrow category of cases, Justice O'Connor, but those cases do exist.",
  "As a -- that's correct, Justice O'Connor, the 1-year statute of limitations applies, but that's also true of other substantive claims, and yet the Court has continued to apply the cause in prejudice standard to encourage the raising of those claims at the earliest available opportunity, and that's the -- that's the principal policy interest behind applying the procedural default rule in this context.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, the question before the Court is -- is purely a Federal question. The States have adopted varying approaches, as we've suggested in our briefs. A significant number of States require the raising of ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal, and judge the raising of an ineffectiveness claim on collateral review by a cause in prejudice standard.",
  "The majority -- it appears that the majority of States go the other way, but it's not entirely clear, Justice Stevens, because some of the States haven't spoken directly on the question. What we -- what we know is that 19 States -- it was 20 at the time we filed our brief, but it's now 19, follow the cause in prejudice approach and require the raising of ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal, and there's at least a significant number of States that don't require the raising of ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal, but it's unclear whether there's more than 20, and so we don't know exactly whether it's a majority or not, but -- but there at least are a significant number that apply procedural default principles to the raising of claims on direct appeal, and that's --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, our position was that there was no need for national uniformity in the sense that the Court need not grant review to impose a national -- national uniform rule. We didn't -- we thought that there was no unfairness in the existing divergence of approaches among the courts of appeals, because in each court of appeals, a defendant had notice of the particular approach that applied in that circuit, and so a defendant knew ahead of time whether he had to raise its ineffectiveness claim on direct appeal, or whether he could wait without penalty and raise it on collateral review.",
  "Correct, Justice Ginsburg. Now that the Court has granted certiorari, we think it would be appropriate for this Court to adopt a Nationwide rule similar to what the Court essentially did in Bousley, where the question was the proper time for raising an objection to a guilty plea on grounds that the plea was not voluntary, or -- or intelligent, and the Court reached a resolution that required the raising of those claims on direct appeal and adopted, it -- it appears, a Nationwide solution, and we think a similar approach would be appropriate in this case, that the Court should decide whether on a national scale ineffectiveness claims can always be brought on collateral review without any concerns about procedural default, or, as we think is appropriate, that ineffectiveness claims should be required to be raised on direct appeal in those situations in which counsel is new and the record -- the record for the claim is fully developed in the trial record.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, there -- there are decisions that address that issue in the State courts, and I believe at least a couple that address that issue in the Federal courts, and generally, the approach has been that defenders from the same Public -- attorneys from the same Public Defender's Office are considered the same attorney for purposes of conflict, determining whether there's a conflict in one alleging that the other rendered ineffective assistance. And that, I think, comes from the ABA professional rules, and I -- and I believe it's Model Rule 1.1, which suggests that competence is imputed to attorneys that operate within the same firm, and that confirms that, at least for private firm purposes, two attorneys from the same firm would be considered to be the same attorney for procedural default -- default purposes, and we think the same approach would follow with respect to Public Defender's Offices, so I don't think that the question of the same attorney is going to give rise to a great deal of litigation or uncertainty. The rules in that area ought to be pretty clear.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, that's correct, but I think it's important to point out that that question, that situation is going to arise regardless of how this Court resolves the procedural default question, because in all the courts of appeals a defendant can raise an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal.",
  "Typically, yes, that's the way 2255 works, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "No, I think as I was -- as I was attempting to suggest in response to Justice Ginsburg's question, I think that would be considered the same attorney, and that follows from conflicts principles.",
  "That attorneys within the same office are considered to be the same attorney for purposes of conflicts, and that informs the proper approach in -- in the procedural default inquiry, but I think it's important to note that all the courts of appeals are confronted with ineffective assistance claims that are raised on direct appeal. No court of appeals prohibits the assertion of an ineffectiveness claim on direct appeal, so in every court, the court of appeals is faced with one of three options at the time an ineffectiveness claim is raised. They can deny the claim on the merits if they can conclude that in no circumstances the claim could succeed, they could grant relief on ineffectiveness grounds in the narrow category of cases in which entitlement to relief will be apparent from the trial record, or they could decline to resolve the claim and remit its resolution to 2255, and that's precisely the same three options that confront the Second Circuit and the Seventh Circuit, who apply the procedural default rule. So Justice Ginsburg, in response to your question, the courts of appeals are faced with the same array of options whether this Court adopts a procedural default principle or not, and in the Ninth Circuit, for example, in 2001, the Court faced roughly on the order of 50 direct appeals in which ineffective assistance of counsel was asserted as a basis for relief, and in 10 of those cases, the Court was able to decide conclusively that the claim was lacking in merit and therefore couldn't be brought again under 2255, and --",
  "That -- that possibility certainly is there, Justice Ginsburg, but I think the same possibility arises at the time of collateral review, when the attorney -- when you'd expect the attorney equally to desire the cooperation of trial counsel, but any effort to assert ineffectiveness could create the same sort of tension in the relationship.",
  "I -- I don't have statistics of that variety, Justice O'Connor. I think it's been generally recognized by several courts that ineffective assistance claims are often raised on collateral review, and I think it's fair to say that in a significant portion of -- of 2255 petitions, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim will be at least one ground for relief. And one effect of applying a procedural default principle would be to encourage the raising and resolution of those claims on direct appeal in those situations in which it's appropriate, and I think it's important to point out that there are at least some cases in which a court of appeals can resolve, on the basis of the trial record, that the -- that trial counsel either was or was not ineffective, and this Court, for example, in its -- in its Kimmelman decision, the -- pointed out that trial counsel's ineffectiveness, at least in terms of the performance prong of the Strickland inquiry, was apparent from the trial record, and there will be situations like that that arise every so often, and perhaps more frequently an appellate court will be able to determine that trial counsel's performance was not ineffective and will be able to make that determination perhaps because, no matter how deficient the performance was, the -- the particular matter at issue could never have resulted in prejudice for the defendant. For example, if the claim of ineffectiveness is that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to competently impeach a particular witness, an appellate court could perhaps look at the trial record and determine that the testimony of that particular witness was not central to the prosecution's case, and in those circumstances, could a more effective impeachment have given rise to a reasonable probability that the result at trial would have been different. So there are going to be some situations in which a court of appeals can resolve an ineffectiveness claim at the time of direct appeal, and in those situations, it seems appropriate to encourage the raising of the claim at that stage in order to promote respect for the finality of criminal judgments and also to promote the resolution of legal claims at the earliest feasible opportunity.",
  "We're not aware that --",
  "Well, we're not aware of any -- of any effect of that sort in either the Second or Seventh Circuits which apply the procedural default rule, and -- and I think if trial counsel's involved in the gamesmanship, one would have to conceive of a situation in which trial counsel found it in his interest to ensure that appellate counsel could confirm his ineffectiveness at trial, and that situation perhaps is unlikely to arise. And in terms of the distinction between appellate counsel calling into question trial counsel's ineffectiveness, and trial counsel calling into question his own ineffectiveness, Justice Kennedy, this Court in Kimmelman observed what I think would -- is a common sense proposition, which is that trial counsel is unlikely to bring into question his own competence at trial and, in fact, he would -- he would create a conflict situation, and therefore the system just doesn't operate on the assumption that trial counsel should be required to identify his own ineffectiveness and bring it to the attention of the trial court.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, it's true that -- that ineffective assistance of appellate counsel is -- would constitute cause for failing to raise the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel at -- on direct appeal, that that is also true in -- with all other substantive claims, that ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failing to raise any substantive claim at the time of direct appeal could constitute cause excusing the default, yet this Court has continued to apply procedural default principles in the case of other substantive claims, and so I'm not sure that that particular consideration tips the balance decidedly in one direction or the other. And in fact, the Court has made clear in decisions such as Murray versus Carrier and Smith versus Murray, and -- and recently in Smith versus Robbins, that it's difficult to make out a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel because appellate counsel's decision whether to raise a particular claim is the hallmark of effective advocacy, and one would have to show that appellate counsel was unreasonable in failing to present one claim instead of another at the time of appellate briefing in order to establish that there was cause for failing to raise ineffective assistance of trial counsel at the time of direct appeal.",
  "Justice Souter, the Government won't get that chance if it's resolved on direct appeal. If it's raised on direct appeal, the Government, of course, shares an interest in assuring that the trial court -- that the appellate court, excuse me, does not resolve the claim because it would say --",
  "Well, in order to ameliorate that possibility, Justice Souter, the Seventh Circuit, for example, has adopted a standard under which it will not decide a claim of ineffectiveness in the defendant's favor unless there's no possible strategic rationale for counsel's decision and, of course, to the extent that there may be a strategic rationale for the counsel's decision, it'll be in the Government's interest to bring that to the court's attention in its appellate briefing, and we haven't seen too many situations in which a court grants a claim of ineffectiveness on direct appeal, but yet there was potentially a strategic rationale for counsel's decision. In fact, the court should grant relief on ineffectiveness grounds on direct appeal only in situations such as the one that confronted the Court in Kimmelman, where there was an extended dialogue between trial counsel and the trial court concerning trial counsel's assertively deficient decision --",
  "-- and trial counsel was able to explain to the trial court the basis of its decision, and from trial counsel's explanation, one could determine that it wasn't based on a strategic rationale, but instead was based simply on a misunderstanding of the time, of the timeliness of the rejection rule that was at issue.",
  "That -- that could arise, Mr. Chief Justice. That's -- that's one potential evidentiary way to show that trial counsel was ineffective.",
  "I'm not -- I don't know the answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice. I don't know to what extent privileges weigh into it.",
  "That's correct.",
  "That's -- that's correct, Justice Souter. It's in the Government -- the Government does do that, and it's in their interest to do that to ensure that the result of trial is upheld.",
  "I think that's right, Justice Kennedy. If I could turn just for one moment to the application of a procedural default rule to the facts of this case, in -- if the procedural default rule were to be applied, the question at the time of collateral review is whether -- is whether the defendant has introduced extrinsic evidence not available in the trial record in support of this claim of ineffectiveness, and the court of appeals in this case found that there was no extrinsic evidence material to the claim of ineffectiveness introduced in the affidavits on which petitioner relies because the affidavits suggests avenues of inquiry the trial counsel could have pursued that trial counsel in fact did pursue. For example, on the facts of this particular case, that there was no blood spatter remaining from the wound, and that -- that no blood spatter reflected on the upholstery of the car, or no blood itself on the front passenger seat, or that the body of the -- the position of the body wasn't consistent with the testimony concerning the firing of the second shot, and I think it's important to point out that in all of those avenues were, in fact, explored by the trial record -- excuse me, by trial counsel, and were presented to the jury, and the jury evidently found them not persuasive.",
  "She did. She offered a continuance on repeated occasions to trial counsel, and trial counsel turned it down, but I think the defendant's burden at the time of collateral review now is to show that the refusal of a continuance worked to the defendant's detriment and resulted in a reasonable probability that the result at trial would have been different had he -- had he accepted a continuance, and the affidavits only present avenues of inquiry that trial counsel in fact pursued, which indicates, and I think in some sense confirms, that a continuance would not have affected the result at trial. If there are no further questions, Mr. Chief Justice --",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The totality of the circumstances apparent to the officer at the scene established probable cause for respondent's arrest. Of particular significance, the officer uncovered drugs that were packaged for distribution and that were concealed in the location in which they were readily discoverable by the other passengers.",
  "It's - we don't intend -",
  "We don't intend to suggest a broad rule, Justice O'Connor.",
  "Yes, it's a totality of the circumstances test, and it will turn on contextual factors that are present in any particular case.",
  "Well, what - what we intend to say is that ordinarily when drugs that are packaged for distribution are found in a location in which they're readily discoverable by the other passengers, a reasonable officer can fairly conclude that there's a fair probability that each passenger is - is aware of the drugs, but of course in particular cases -",
  "Absolutely, Justice O'Connor.",
  "No. The inference is tethered to the particular facts of this case. In cases that present different facts, for example, if a child was in the car of - if, as was earlier discussed, a hitchhiker were in the car, the probable - probable cause calculus would be different. But in this case there was no reason to suspect that any of the individuals was uninvolved in the possession of the cocaine. In fact, what's particularly significant in this case in our view is the location in which the drugs were found, because they were found wedged behind the rear seat armrest, which apparently is the type of armrest that's adjustable in an up or down position. The very purpose of that type of armrest is to give the passenger an option according to his preference whether the position - the armrest in one position or the other, so it's highly -",
  "Well, I - it - there's a - I think there's a different question concerning whether there was probable cause for an arrest and the determination by an officer whether to proceed with charges. Just because the officer -",
  "There might well have been, Justice Stevens, because an officer's not required to believe the version of events that's given to him by people on the scene. It might well be the case that they have a coordinated plan in advance to pin the blame on a particular person as opposed to the other two, and an officer can take into account the totality of circumstances in making that type of assessment.",
  "That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. It's not necessarily a common enterprise. It could be any one of the three or it could be all of them or some combination of the three of them, and the combination of those various scenarios rose to the level of a fair probability that respondent was involved with the cocaine. And as I was - as I was saying, that's particularly the case because they were concealed behind the armrest, which is a type of instrument that affirmatively invites manipulation by a passenger, so if one of the occupants of the vehicle alone were responsible for carrying cocaine, it seems quite unlikely that he would have chosen the area behind the armrest as a place to conceal it from the other passengers.",
  "The probable cause standard works the same. In both situations the question would be whether there's a fair probability. Now -",
  "Well, it's -",
  "It's often the case that prosecutors will have more rigorous standards as a matter of internal - matter of internal guidelines. And for example, in the U.S. Attorney's manual, it dictates that prosecutors in the Federal system need to ensure that it's likely that they'll be able to obtain a conviction on -",
  "Right. The nature of the application of the probable cause standard is different in the prosecutorial stage because the prosecutor is identifying a particular offense, laying out the facts to support that offense, and the -",
  "Correct. That remains constant in both scenarios.",
  "There's a different - there's a different question whether the evidence is sufficient to convict as presented by the prosecutor and whether the prosecutor has enough to go forward with the charges.",
  "As long as there's probable cause to go forward, the prosecutor can go forward with the charges.",
  "That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and -",
  "Well, he could go -",
  "Well, that's -",
  "Well, that's - that's different from the facts of this case, but even assuming that it were an equal likelihood that each of them independently were involved in the offense, the prosecutor could go forward in that situation, but it's highly unlikely that he would go forward in that situation because - because he's unlikely to obtain to a verdict in his favor. So there's institutional incentives -",
  "That's correct, Justice Kennedy.",
  "No, not should bring cases -",
  "May, under the Constitution.",
  "And that's why, I think, prosecutors typically enforce upon themselves a more rigorous obligation than the probable cause standard.",
  "No, there's no case that I'm aware of that says that they can't proceed where there's probable cause.",
  "In - in the Federal system -",
  "- there's Federal guidelines that spell out when Federal prosecutors are supposed to bring cases to trial, but I'm not aware that that's required by Federal law or by the Constitution. Each prosecutor's office might have their own -",
  "I don't - I don't have the particular provision.",
  "That's correct. Each prosecutor's office might have different standards.",
  "Right. Well, the deficiencies in the Maryland court's probable cause analysis, we think, are particularly are apparent when one considers the implications for officers at the scene in circumstances like this case, because apparently the up-shot is that officers either could arrest no one or that they could arrest the driver alone, and the latter situation seems unsound because perhaps the least likely scenario in circumstances like this case is that - that the driver was acting alone and carrying the contraband in the car, because if the driver in fact were acting alone, one might expect that he would conceal the contraband in a location in which it was not so readily discoverable by the other passengers.",
  "Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it's possible that innocent persons will be arrested and bound over in circumstances like in this case, but the probable cause standard accepts that possibility as the cost of ensuring the effective enforcement of the criminal laws. In fact, this Court reiterated in Wardlow recently that the probable cause standard accepts that innocent persons may be arrested on occasion. That's simply the cost of a functioning criminal justice system.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A person detained, based on reasonable suspicion of crime, may be required to provide his name to officers because that requirement contributes significantly to the ability of law enforcement officers to ensure their own safety and that of the public while imposing only a minimal burden on an individual's protected interests in privacy.

  "No, it would, but the -- the reason why the Fourth Amendment requires a showing a reasonable basis to believe that they're armed and dangerous before conducting a patdown is because, as the Court described the patdown in Terry, it represents a severe intrusion on the person's personal security. And that's not the case for the question, what is your name. That doesn't represent any sort of physical intrusion on the person whatsoever.",
  "That's --",
  "Well, that's critical to explaining why in all cases the officer should have an authority to compel the person to disclose his name.",
  "That's correct.",
  "What you're pointing to, Justice O'Connor, I believe is the dictum that was discussed early in Berkemer v. -- in Berkemer v. McCarty. And that, first of all, is dictum, but not only is it dictum, it's ambiguous dictum because the language that the Court used was that the officer is entitled to ask a moderate number of questions, first, to determine the person's identity and, second, to obtain information with which to confirm or dispel the officer's suspicions. And then the Court goes on to say that, of course, the detainee is not required to respond. It's unclear whether that statement concerning that the detainee is not required to respond relates to the initial basis for asking questions which is determinative of his identity.",

And of course, that would be crucial in -- in terms of public safety because it could prevent commission of an imminent offense or the ongoing commission of a continuing offense.",

Now, the tribes have to point to some source of funding within that lump sum appropriation.",

  "If -- if all that's at issue is a standard subject to availability clause in a contract and there were no reduction clause, as there is in this statute, and you're dealing with the standard procurement context, then there is a Court of Claims decision, the Blackhawk decision, that suggests, albeit in a footnote, that in that situation, there are funds available in the sense that they're legally unrestricted.",
  "There aren't any funds that are available here in our view because -­",

But there are provisions, I should note parenthetically, in the appropriations act that say specifically, for example, that not to exceed a certain amount is to be used for a particular function or at least a certain amount is to be used, for example, for contract health services. So you'd have to take into account -­",
  "-- those particular provisos.",
  "Well, first and foremost, the text of the statute. If you look at page 15a of the appendix to -- to the tribes' briefs, this isn't your standard, garden variety subject to availability clause. You have to look at the particular context in which this statute -­",
  "It's not, Justice O'Connor, with respect. It says, notwithstanding any other provision -- and I'm reading at the bottom of page 15a -­ the provision of funds under this subchapter is subject to the availability of appropriations and -- and this is -­",
  "That particular phrase resembles the one that Justice Breyer posited in his hypothetical.",
  "But the term available -- and I think this is critical. The term available is repeated in what's been referred to as the reduction clause, and I don't think one can understand what the term available means unless it considers the meaning of that term throughout that entire sentence.",
  "I -- I think that argument is incorrect. First of all, it's an incorrect interpretation of the terms of the reduction clause. But second of all, the notion that funds for inherent Federal functions, the 2 percent that the agency reserved to perform its core agency functions, were available for contracting is contrary to -- to the terms of the ISDA itself. And if you'll look at page 12a -- and I'm quoting from 450j-1(a)(1) -- what provision says is the amount of funds provided under the terms of self-determination contracts include the amount that the Secretary, quote, would have otherwise provided. And then later on down in the paragraph -­",
  "I'm sorry. It's -­",
  "Shall not -- shall be not less than the amount that the appropriate Secretary would have otherwise provided. And then further down in the paragraph in the last -- in the last clause, including support of administrative functions that are otherwise contractable. And what otherwise contractable denotes is that there are certain functions that are not otherwise contractable, namely those core, inherent Federal functions that the agency itself is required to provide. And so what 450j­ 1(a) implements is the background understanding that funds for core agency functions don't have to be turned over to the contracting tribes because the agency requires those funds in order to continue essentially to exist as a Federal agency.",
  "I don't think so, Justice Kennedy. I think it's more of a characterization disagreement. There -- it's true that in a descriptive sense, one might refer to some of these funds as used for contract monitoring, but what 450j-1(a) says is that whatever you might call it, the funds that are used for core agency functions are outside the funds to be -- to be turned over.",
  "Correct.",
  "Well, it's talking about both because the -- the first part of subparagraph (1) is the amount of funds. It's relating to the amount of funds that are required to be transferred, and what it stands for is that funds for supportive administrative functions that are not otherwise contractable, i.e., those core agency functions that the agency is required to perform itself, those funds aren't required to be turned over to contracting tribes. And that just reflects the common sense principle that the agency has to continue to exist to perform some core functions.",
  "Justice Ginsburg, the way we square that under the statute is that the leading -- the initial sentence in subsection (b) says the amount of funds required by subsection (a) of this section. And our view of the statute is that funds for inherent Federal functions were never required to be transferred under subsection (a) to begin with. And so what (b) deals with is the funds that are left over after the funds for inherent Federal functions are taken off the top.",
  "Oh, absolutely there are. The Federal functions is the broader set of -- it could essentially encompass everything the Federal Government does. Inherent Federal functions refers to that core set of functions that the agency itself is required to perform. And the distinction between inherent Federal functions and Federal functions, although it might seem trivial as a semantic matter, is reflected in fact in the definitions in title V of the ISDA where it specifically defines inherent Federal functions as a subset of Federal functions.",
  "It -- it does.",
  "It does, Justice Scalia -­ Justice Souter. Excuse me.",
  "And we describe the -- the relevant provision in our brief, if you'll bear with me for just one second, on page 31. When Congress enacted the title IV self-governance provisions that relate to the BIA -- and this is at the beginning of the first partial paragraph that begins with of particular significance. There's a provision there, 25 U.S.C. 458cc(k). And the provision reads that nothing in this section is intended or shall be construed to expand or alter existing statutory authorities so as to authorize the Secretary to enter into any agreement with respect to functions that are inherently Federal. And I think what that signifies is that there are some functions that are not contractable and can't be turned over to the tribes.",
  "Justice Breyer, one background principle -- and it's reflected, by the way, in the terms of the contracts themselves. One background principle is that funds for inherent Federal functions are not required to be transferred to tribes. And the contracts -­",

  "Well, there is, Justice Stevens, in the following sense. It's not at all the case that the Secretary had unfettered discretion in composing the allocation scheme in any fiscal year.",
  "In -- in part it was mandated by the statute.",
  "Perhaps not in whole -­",
  "-- but at least in significant part. And let me -- but I think this is significant, and if I can just walk the Court through the process by which the budget is developed and any appropriation ultimately is allocated. The Secretary has always, both before the ISDA and after the ISDA, taken the current year's allocation across programs as a given, as a baseline from which the next year's allocation will be built. And that's reflected in the terms of the statute on pages 14a to 15a of the appendix to the blue brief. There's a provision, 450j-1(b)(2), that says that the amount that's transferred to contractors shall not be reduced by the Secretary in subsequent years except pursuant to certain limited criteria and one of which, the principal one of which, is the reduction in appropriations. But we're not dealing with that in the relevant fiscal years. There was always an increase. And so the Secretary, pursuant to the statute, kept the funding for across programs at least at the level that it was at the previous fiscal year. Now, in addition to that, the Secretary builds two -- two considerations on top. The first is mandatory across-the-board increases for things such as salary COLA's and inflationary adjustments. And that's a standard feature of budgeting, and it's reflected again in the terms of the statute. And that -- I'd point the Court to page 9 of the Government's brief, the gray brief, where we cite a provision, 25 U.S.C. 1680a.",
  "It was -- I -- I think in principal part it was mandated by the -- by -­",
  "Well, let -­",
  "At least as far --",
  "-- insofar as what I've said with respect -­",
  "Sorry.",
  "No, Justice Stevens.",
  "No, I don't think that they have discretion to do that. And that's what I'm trying to explain. At least with respect to the existing baseline and a mandatory across-the-board increases, it's mandated by the statute that the -- that the Secretary conduct his budgeting allocation process in the way that he's done. With respect to the mandatory across-the-board increases, on page 9 of the Government's brief, 25 U.S.C. 1680a, a provision that relates specifically to the administration of the Self-Determination Act, it requires the Secretary to provide funds to contracting tribes for, quote, cost-of-living increases, closed quote, and, quote, other expenses relating to the provision of health services, closed quote, on the, quote, same basis as such funds are provided to programs and services operated directly. In other words, with respect to mandatory across-the-board increases, the Secretary has to allocate those proportionately amongst contracting tribes and non­ contracting tribes. And that leaves the additional set of an increase from one year to the next year that deals with specific targeted items, and principally that would include, for example, staffing of new facilities that come on board during the course of a particular fiscal year. And with respect to those specific targeted items, the critical point is that the contracting tribes often benefit from the addition of those and from the enforcement by the Secretary of those sorts of earmarks. For example, in this particular case, the -- one of the facilities that's at issue is the Stillwell clinic in Oklahoma. That was a new facility that came on board in the early 1990s and for which the -- for which the Cherokee Nation assumed administration of it through a self-determination agreement. Now, the staffing for that facility was specifically earmarked in the Secretary's budget submissions and in -- in Congress' appropriation committee reports. And it, of course, is in the Cherokee Nation's interest to ensure that those earmarks are honored.",
  "They're not binding law, Justice Stevens. We fully recognize that. But at the same time, I don't think that what Congress intended to do was to require the Secretary to completely ignore the committee reports.",
  "It's not just the committee reports, Justice Souter. It's the reduction clause. The reduction clause is a part of the statute and no one has ever suggested the reduction clause doesn't inform the proper interpretation of the contract.",
  "That is what they're saying, Justice Souter, but with respect to, I think it's incorrect. The Government bureaucracy consists of two separate types of bureaucracy. There's that core bureaucracy that is the inherent Federal functions. And one of their arguments is that the Secretary was required to divest himself of the funds that were necessary to perform those functions.",
  "Because, Justice Breyer, I think the core of it is that even if you think that they're right, that these funds are legally available, that's not enough under the ISDA because the ISDA specifically reserves to the Secretary the discretion that he not be required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe in order to make funds available to another tribe under this subchapter.",
  "No. They thought -- the -- the board -- the Federal Circuit at least, which echoed the Board of Contract Appeals, thought -­",
  "Well, I don't think the Board of -- of Contract Appeals really wrestled directly with where the funds were coming from. They just thought that legal availability would be sufficient. Now, what the Federal Circuit said was that funds for inherent Federal functions are available. And we think that's wrong for the reasons I've said. I don't think those funds ever came into the group of funds that were subject to be transferred to begin with. But even if you thought that they did, I think it's clear that funds for inherent Federal functions are funds for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe in the sense that one example of a core Federal function -­",
  "Well, let's -- Justice Souter, if I -- if I could, let's look at the particular sources -­",
  "Well, I -- I guess the way I'd like to make the point is to say that the sources of funds that they point to, which include inherent Federal functions and the -- the noninherent Federal function bureaucracy that supports the administration of programs that serve tribes that are directly served by the Federal Government, those two are in fact programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe. With respect to the administrative support -­",
  "I don't -- I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg. I mean, one straightforward reason why you don't have to take that assumption is that it's not only the Federal Circuit case that's before the Court, it's also the Tenth Circuit case. And there's -- there are declarations in the Tenth Circuit case that specifically assert that diverting funding for -- to pay for the contract support costs of these tribes would have required reducing funds for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe.",
  "So --",
  "We're talking about both existing programs and new programs, and with respect to new programs, there's -- it's every bit as likely that those new programs would benefit contracting tribes as noncontracting tribes. And again, one of the new facilities -­",
  "Because -­",
  "Well, I don't think that reduce necessarily takes the existing year's appropriation as the baseline. We think that what it takes as the baseline is the current year's appropriation allocation which takes into account increases. And one way to see that is 25 U.S.C. 1680a, which is the provision that I cited earlier that requires the Secretary to apportion mandatory across­ the-board increases on a proportionate basis as between contracted programs and noncontracted programs. And what that provision means is that the reduction takes into account those mandatory across-the-board increases from year to year. So in some sense, I think reduce does mean this year's allocation of appropriations as opposed to last year's spending amount.",
  "Well, they -- they make the point as a general matter, and they also give an example. I think the one example that they give -- and maybe there are more -- is -- is a diabetes program. But I think it's more the general principle -­",
  "That's an -- the -- the particular example is an existing program. But I think it's more -­",
  "You're -- you're speaking with particular respect to the new programs, Justice Stevens?",
  "Well, I don't think that even with respect to the current year there wouldn't be enough money to pay for the complete shortfall in contract support costs. If you look at the figures, the shortfall in contract support costs, for example, in 1997 cumulatively was $82 million, and that's -- that is more than the amount of the appropriation increase from FY 1996 to FY 1997. It's more than the amount that was reserved by the Government for inherent Federal functions. And so even if you accepted that interpretation, it wouldn't be sufficient to fully fund the contract support costs.",
  "Justice O'Connor, Congress changed things by imposing a statutory cap, explicit statutory cap, on contract support cost funding beginning with 1998. It had done so since 1994 for the BIA and it did so beginning in 1998 with respect to IHS.",
  "I think the difference lies in the extent to which there was perceived to be a shortfall. My understanding is that there was a shortfall already in BIA programs whereas the shortfall didn't really become evident with respect to the IHS until 1994 and beyond. And that's why you might see the discrepancy between the two. But Congress also acted, by the way, in 1998 in the 1999 Appropriations Act in enacting section 314 of the 1999 Appropriations Act. And I think, if nothing else, section 314 at list -- at least expresses the view of a subsequent Congress that the Secretary's allocation scheme from 1994 to 1997 was legitimate and was fully within his discretion under the ISDA. And under this Court's decisions in Red Lion and its progeny, that determination by a subsequent Congress is at least entitled to great weight in determining what the Secretary appropriately exercised discretion in 1994 through 1997. So even if you thought that there was some doubt on whether the Secretary had carried out his functions consistently with the ISDA, I think Congress' saying later in the 1999 Appropriation Act that its view was that Secretary had done so legitimately should push the Court towards ruling in our favor on the initial interpretation of the ISDA. I want to address really quickly, if I could, the notion that the funds for administrative support for programs that are administered directly by the Federal Government are available. And that would have significant consequences because one of the policies underlying the act is not only to protect the interests of tribes that are currently entered into self-determination contracts, but it's to protect the amounts that are available to tribes that might some day choose to enter into self­ determination contracts. And if, under the tribes' view, the Secretary was required to divert the entire amount of the increase in any particular year to contracting tribes or to -- to divert the entire amount of administrative support for -- for noncontracted programs to contracting tribes, the effect of that would be to freeze in place the amounts that were available for potentially contracting tribes in future years. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The trial court in this case was permitted to correct its erroneous ruling in favor of the defendant on the motion for judgment of acquittal. Because the prosecution is entitled to a full and fair opportunity to prove its case, that's a value - -",
  "Would we have the same appraisal as the State? We don't - -",
  "No. We -- we think that the Court's holding in Smalis applies equally to jury trials and to bench trials such that an appeal, an interlocutory appeal, in the midst of a jury trial would not be permissible. But we also think that there is a sound basis for drawing a distinction between - -",
  "Right, because we read that to be the holding of Smalis. But we think there's a basis for distinguishing between appeals on one hand and continuing proceedings before the initial tribunal on the other hand. First of all, this Court has drawn that distinction in Swisher v. Brady where it initially said that the two-stage system of adjudication is -- in Maryland that was at issue in that case was permissible because it entailed continued proceedings before the initial tribunal rather than an appeal to a second tribunal. And the Court specifically distinguished its prior decisions in Jenkins v. the United States and Kepner, both of which involved appellate review. And the other basis for drawing a distinction between appeals on one hand and reconsiderations by the trial court on the other is historical tradition. I think the Court could look to history and history would show that on one hand trial courts have always had inherent authority to reconsider their mid-trial rulings because the practical exigencies of trial are such that trial courts inevitably will err on occasion, and the ends of justice require trial courts to have the authority to revisit their mid-trial rulings.",
  "We would, Justice Kennedy, but it raises a distinct problem because one value that's served by the Double Jeopardy Clause is the defendant's interest in preventing the prosecution from honing its evidentiary case by repeated efforts. And if the trial judge were permitted to reopen the case to give the prosecution that opportunity, it at least would implicate that interest. Now, we still think that the proper line is jury discharge, but we understand that that hypothetical would present a distinct interest. Now, with respect to historical tradition on appeals, the historical tradition is clear that the government has lacked authority at common law to take an appeal in a criminal proceeding. This Court relied on that common law tradition as early as Sanges v. the United States and it's repeated that understanding in Carroll v. the United States and Arizona v. Manypenny, and that's why the Court construes statutory grants of authority to the government to take an appeal in criminal cases quite narrowly. And so I think the Court could draw a distinction between reconsiderations by the trial court and appeals by looking to historical tradition, and the Court often looks at history to shape the contours of double jeopardy protections. And that would afford the case -- the Court a basis for saying that in Smalis, while appeals were forbidden, in this case trial court reconsideration should be permitted. And I think the lens through which the Court would do that under the Double Jeopardy Clause is the valued interest in giving the prosecution one full and fair opportunity to prove its case in the sense that while that full and fair opportunity may exclude an appeal, because the Court held as much in Smalis, it doesn't exclude reconsiderations.",
  "Justice Souter, we think a constitutional rule that would turn on the definitiveness of a trial court ruling would be flawed in three respects. First, the line between a definitive ruling and a tentative ruling is not altogether clear, and we've outlined in our brief at page 24 in a lengthy footnote a variety of factual scenarios that come from real cases where trial judges, as they often do, rendered a ruling on a motion for acquittal orally, and whether you think that ruling was definitive or tentative might depend on which page of the transcript you happen to be looking at. But even if we're dealing with a situation in which the ruling clearly falls on the definitive side of the line, you'd still have the problem that a trial court might be convinced that it's correct and rule definitively but still be incorrect. Trial courts make mistakes. That's why this issue comes up as often as it does. For example, in this case - -",
  "I don't -- I'm not quite sure I'm following what you're saying, Justice Stevens, because - -",
  "But -- but I don't -- but the reason why the Court accepts errors in some situations is because there's some other value under the Double Jeopardy Clause.",
  "Well, it's not just the value of finality. It's that, for example, if the judge makes an error and then the jury is discharged, it's the value that the defendant has in obtaining a result from the particular tribunal. In the circumstances of this case, where the trial judge can correct her error within the - - within a matter of minutes, at least in some situations, there would be no double jeopardy purpose served - -",
  "In this - -",
  "No. I acknowledge in this case it wasn't, but it might well be in some cases. For example, we cite a decision of the Washington Supreme Court, State v. Collins, which involves essentially the same scenario as this case, but the only distinction was that after the trial judge initially announced her ruling, the prosecution had the precedent in hand and within a span of 10 minutes, the trial judge was able to realize her error and to correct her ruling and reinstate the charge.",
  "It would matter, Justice O'Connor, but I don't think it would necessarily preclude the prosecution from going forward on the charge under the Double Jeopardy Clause. The question would be one of due process and prejudice to the defendant.",
  "And the third is -- it's an issue that you raised earlier, Justice Kennedy. It's that this case might look different as an atmospheric matter if the trial judge at the time she rendered her ruling had said, I'm ruling in the defendant's favor, but I may reconsider this decision at a later point in the proceedings. Now, that might be seen to fall on the tentative side of the line, but that's exactly the effect of this -- of the trial judge's ruling as a matter of Massachusetts law. And we don't think there's a constitutionally significant distinction between a trial judge explicitly saying that a ruling can be reconsidered and State law saying that the ruling can be reconsidered.",
  "It -- there -- there -- that would be the basis of a claim, Justice Souter, but the right to rely is, in essence, a notice prejudice sort of claim and that could be handled in the way that trial courts typically handle claims by the defendant that they've detrimentally relied on an initial ruling the trial court has subsequently reconsidered. It would be equally the case, for example, as the State mentioned with respect to an evidentiary ruling that barred the prosecution from introducing a category of evidence, but then the trial judge, later in the proceedings, wanted to revisit that ruling. The question would be whether revisiting the ruling resulted in prejudice to the defendant because the defendant had detrimentally relied on the trial judge's initial determination. And we don't think that prejudice inquiry is meaningfully different when you're dealing with evidentiary rulings as when you're -- as when you're dealing with the reinstatement of a previously acquitted charge.",
  "Well, it would depend. If - - if the bench trial judge were making a mid-trial ruling, as -- as in this case, then the judge could change his or her mind. But if the bench trial judge were resolving the entire case and entered - -",
  "No. The -- the -- I think the Constitution would step in and impose a line at some point, and probably the best indicator is a rule - -",
  "It can't be discharge of the jury, but I think where the Court would look, first and foremost, in defining a line for bench trials, if the issue would ever arise, would be a ruling that would essentially have resulted in discharge of the jury if the trial were before a jury. And for example, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure - -",
  "It was, Justice O'Connor, for purposes of an appeal, and that's why I think the critical distinction between Smalis and this case is that where the prosecution might not have authority to take an appeal from a ruling on the insufficiency of the evidence.",
  "In a bench trial, that -- that would be part of the inquiry, Justice Kennedy, and I would also point, by the way, to -- can I just finish the thought, Justice Stevens? To Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(k)(1), which says that when a bench trial - - when a judge sitting in a bench trial issues a ruling that finds a defendant not guilty, that ruling will discharge the defendant. And I think a discharge of the defendant would be one of critical consideration. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For purposes of determining its State citizenship under 28 U.S.C. 1348, a national banking association is located in the State in which its main office is found, not every State in which it may maintain a branch office or other form of physical presence.",
  "The --",
  "We -- we don't think that a national banking association is a citizen of a State in which its principal place of business is found, insofar as that might be different from the State in which its main office is located.",
  "That's right, Justice Ginsburg, and in part, that's because of the historical chronology. The word located was first used in 1887 and the current version of section 1348 was enacted in 1948, which was 10 years before the concept of principal place of business had any jurisdictional salience. That was the first time that Congress -- this was in 1958 -- that Congress enacted a specific provision dealing with corporate citizenship, and that's the first time that we see the concept of principal place of business having relevance in the jurisdictional context.",
  "No. But -- but Bougas I think is -- shouldn't govern the resolution of this case for several reasons, and one that I think is salient with respect to the points that you were raising earlier, Justice Scalia, is that it really is a happenstance of codification that the terms, established and located, appear together in section 1348. The paragraph that contained established and the paragraph that contained located were enacted in separate years. They concerned separate subjects, and they were always treated as separate provisions until the recodification of the judicial code in 1911. And that recodification stated in its explicit text that the provisions were -- were to continue to carry the substantive meaning that they had beforehand and that the arrangement of the provisions were purely -- was purely for convenience. And so I don't think it's fair to say that because established and located happen to appear in the same provision of section 1348 that they necessarily should be given different meanings.",
  "Just about, Justice Souter. I -- the -- the paragraph containing established was in there in the 1863 National Banking Law, and -- and the provision containing located was added to that provision in 1864. So the first time that they both appeared, they did appear together, which is another distinction from the circumstance that the Court faces with respect to 1348.",
  "That's right.",
  "It would still be the main office. The -- the national bank charter -- I think it's called the organization certificate under the terms of the statute -- is a historic document that documents where the national bank's initial main office was located. But, of course, a national bank can relocate its main office under 12 U.S.C. 30. And we think that when a national bank relocates its main office, it's the current main office that's controlling.",
  "Even if its charter says something else.",
  "You don't. In fact -- in fact, there's no provision for amending the charter. What you have to do is amend your articles of association if you move the main office -- if you move the main office outside the city or town in which the main office previously was found.",
  "Well, as I was saying, you'd have to amend the articles of association if you move to a different city. So you could look at the articles of association, and those are on file with the Comptroller. So I think where a national bank's main office is located is readily identifiable and it's publicly available information.",
  "That's right. It's -- it's -- the main office is -- is controlled by where the national bank designates its main office to be. Now, it's a little bit different than corporations in the following sense, that with the main office of a national bank, it at least has to be a place where the bank is conducting the business of banking. That's required by the statutes. Whereas with a corporation, you could conceivably have a situation where they were incorporated in one State --",
  "That's right, for --",
  "For purposes of this provision. There -- there are other provisions where the word located encompasses branch locations, but for purposes of this provision, we think location is synonymous with main office. And I would say that the court of appeals assumed in its opinion, by the way -- and this is at pages 8a and 11a of the -- of the petition appendix -- that it's rarely going to be the case that a national bank's main office will -- will deviate from the national bank's principal place of business.",
  "It -- in -- in some circumstances, yes. If it changes its main office --",
  "-- the same city --",
  "No, because it's a -- it's simply a product of where the --",
  "I -- I think so. I don't -- I'm not aware of any criterion by which -- substantive criterion by which the Comptroller limits where a national banking association could designate its main office to be.",
  "Yes. It -- it has significance in a number of provisions. For example, it determines where the bank is located with respect to what interest rates it might charge under 12 U.S.C. 85, and that's an issue that this Court confronted a few terms ago in the Smiley case and also in the Marquette case. But there are other provisions that refer to the -- the location of a national banking association, and in all of those we think, as a starting point, the location would be the main office, and in some situations, it would also encompass branch locations. For purposes of this provision, we don't think that the location would encompass branch locations. And one reason, in particular, is because the subject that section 1348 deals with is the State citizenship of a national banking association. And the concept of citizenship has always been thought to require a distinctive association with a State and, in particular, has been thought to require something more than mere physical presence in a State. That's always been the rule with respect to national persons, and of particular significance, it's always been a rule with respect -- it's always been the rule with respect to corporations. And Congress defined national banking associations as, quote, a body corporate, close quote, in 12 U.S.C. 24.",

  "No. Our view is that it wouldn't be a citizen of a State simply by virtue of the fact that it has its principal place of business there. Now, I would say, though, that it's not an open and shut case because the Court in a case that specifically raised the issue, which of course this one doesn't, it could construe 1332(c), which is the provision that deals with corporations generally, as also applying to national banking associations insofar as national banking associations are, after all, corporations. But we think the better reading is that the specific governs the general, and therefore, that section 1348, which specifically deals with the question of national bank citizenship, would govern over the 1332(c) which more generally deals with the question of corporate citizenship.",
  "That's right. It would entirely eliminate favoritism. But I think it's important to note that the type of favoritism that we're discussing is the potential inequity as between one State and two States; whereas under the court of appeals' interpretation of section 1348, you could have an inequity that -- and it's not farfetched to think -- that would encompass 50 States in the case of a national banking association and one or two States in the case of a State corporation. And so we're --",
  "No. They're -- they're not State chartered corporations. They're federally chartered corporations, but they are corporate in the -- as -- as distinguished from other sort of forms that an entity, an incorporeal entity, may take. And Congress specifically provided that in 12 U.S.C. 24 --",
  "-- when it defined them as, quote, a body corporate, close quote. So I think it makes sense to apply the normal rules that we apply to corporate citizenship.",
  "They're not incorporated under the laws of any State, but they're incorporated under -- under the National Bank Act. They're federally chartered corporations like other federally chartered corporations. And so in that sense, we think it makes sense to apply the normal rules that apply to corporate citizenship to national banks.",
  "If I could just -- just briefly.",
  "I think what I'm trying to say is that federally -- national banks are federally chartered corporations and they share the salient characteristics of a corporation, i.e., there's limited liability for shareholders -- and that's at 12 U.S.C. 64(a) -- and they have a perpetual existence in the same way that corporations do, and that's at 12 U.S.C. 24.",
  "That -- that's our view, but again, I'm -- I wouldn't characterize it an -- as an open and shut case because 1332(c) refers generally to corporations, and so one could reach the conclusion that 1332's reference to principal place of business should also apply to national banks.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1231(a)(5) aims to streamline the removal of aliens who were already removed but have since illegally reentered. The Congress that enacted IIRIRA did not intend to grandfather the provision and exempt those aliens who are already in the country illegally. Rather, the focus on streamlining the rules for getting illegal reentrants out of the country is fully applicable, and, indeed, is especially applicable to illegal reentrants who were already in the country at the time of IIRIRA's enactment. Three considerations, I think, point to the conclusion that section 1231(a)(5) is addressed to removing illegal reentrants from the country, including aliens who are already in the country, and that the provision is not so much addressed to the antecedent act of illegal reentry, as such. The first consideration I would point to is the operation of the provision. And it's useful to bear in mind the following possible scenario in which a person, who's been removed, illegally reenters the country, but then returns to his home country. Now, in that situation the individual would have engaged in the act of illegal reentry, but section 1231(a)(5) simply would have no relevance to him whatsoever, because what section 1231(a)(5) seeks to do is to remove someone who's found in the country on the basis of their previous removal order. Now, if they have engaged in the act of illegal reentry, but then have gone back, section 1231(a)(5) simply is not relevant. And I think that goes to show that what the statute is focused on is not the act of illegal reentry, as such, but, rather, removing someone who's found in the country and who's determined to be an illegal reentrant. Now, that operation stands in significant contrast to the criminal prohibition against illegal reentry, which is at 8 U.S.C. 1326, and the prohibition against illegal entry, which is 8 U.S.C. 1325. With respect to both of those provisions, the act of illegal reentry, or the act of illegal entry, necessarily triggers the operation of the criminal prohibition, and there's nothing that the alien can do after the fact to take himself outside of the -- of the purview of that criminal --",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "That's right. Congress specifically indicated, in the text of IIRIRA, that it's -- it understood the distinction between the way in which those provisions operate and the way that 1231(a)(5) operates. The IIRIRA expanded the scope of the criminal prohibition on an illegal reentry, and it also, for the first time, imposed civil monetary penalties on the act of illegal entry. There were civil fines, and then -- I think, $50 to $250 per episode. But what's critical is that with respect to both of those changes, Congress specified, in the terms of IIRIRA, that they would only apply, on a prospective basis, to acts of illegal entry or reentry that post - dated IIRIRA. Now, Congress made no such specification with respect to 1231(a)(5), and I think that's significant, because what that indicates is that Congress understood that that provision, unlike the two criminal -- unlike the two criminal provisions, focuses not on the act of illegal reentry, as such, but rather --",
  "That's right.",
  "That's right.",
  "That's right, Justice --",
  "-- Souter.",
  "The criminal act is completed at the moment that the criminal reentry is completed, and nothing that he does afterwards can take --",
  "That's right.",
  "That's right. Which is different, obviously, from the operation of section 1231(a)(5). Now, another consideration that I think indicates that section 1231(a)(5) is focused on the timing of the removal, as opposed to the timing of reentry, is to take into account section 1231(a)(5) in the context of Section 1231 as a whole. Section 1231 was a new provision that was enacted by IIRIRA, and Congress entitled it, quote, \"Detention and Removal of Aliens Ordered Removed,\" close quote. And, as its title indicates, the provisions in section 1231, like 1231(a)(5), all pertain to executing an order of removal against an alien who's been ordered removed. For example, those provisions concern the time period within which somebody is to be removed. They address the travel of somebody to the removal destination, the identification of the countries to which they may be removed, the payment of expenses. But all of them address the execution of an order of removal in the same way that section 1231(a)(5) does. Section 1231(a)(5) speaks to the execution of the pre-existing order of removal, the one that the alien had in place when he illegally reentered the country, but it's of a piece with those other provisions, in the sense that it, like them, addresses the timing of removal rather than speaking to the act of illegal reentry, as such. The third consideration, I think, that points to the same conclusion, which is that Congress was focused prospectively on removals that postdated IIRIRA, rather than retrospectively, in some sense, on acts of illegal reentry that predated IIRIRA, is that at the time of illegal reentry, as we explain in -- at length in our brief, an alien would have had no eligibility, as a categorical matter, and at least as a practical matter, for the three types of relief that Petitioner invokes. And those three types of relief are adjustment of status, suspension of deportation, and voluntary departure. Now, with respect to adjustment of status, as the colloquy earlier indicated, at the time that Petitioner illegally reentered the country in 1981, up until 1994, which was just 2 years before IIRIRA, adjustment of status was categorically unavailable to illegal entrants and illegal reentrants. In that light, it's -- one would be hard-pressed to assert that an illegal reentrant would have performed that act in reasonable reliance on the availability of adjustment of status. It was simply --",
  "-- unavailable.",
  "That's right, Justice Scalia. I think a virtue of focusing on the fact that this statute is addressed to the removal, rather than the act of illegal reentry, is that it decides, once and for all, what the temporal reach of the statute is. And --",
  "Well, that might be, Mr. Chief Justice, but his claim is that section 1231(a)(5) should be construed not to apply to anyone who illegally reentered before IIRIRA. And so, I think the proper frame of reference is to look, ex ante, at what someone would be thinking, had they illegally reentered before IIRIRA, because he seeks to treat everyone who illegally reentered before IIRIRA as a uniform category.",
  "Well, two responses. First of all, that's not true with respect to adjustment of status, because someone who reentered before IIRIRA, at least if they reentered before 1984, couldn't have imagined that their marriage to a United States citizen would have given them a basis for adjustment, because adjustment simply was categorically unavailable to illegal entrants.",
  "1994, I'm sorry --",
  "-- I didn't -- I -- in '81, when he illegally reentered, through 1994, adjustment of status was categorically unavailable to people who illegally reentered, so he couldn't --",
  "-- have relied on the availability of that form of relief.",
  "It simply wasn't provided --",
  "It simply wasn't provided for by statute. A precondition of eligibility for adjustment, until 1994, was that the person was not an illegal entrant. So --",
  "I mean, I suppose they could have stayed their hand, in the sense that they wouldn't have applied the immigration laws to begin with, but I don't think there --",
  "-- would have been any basis to stay their hand, in the sense of granting --",
  "-- adjustment of status. I'm sorry?",
  "Sure.",
  "Not with respect to adjustment of status.",
  "Yes, I'm speaking --",
  "-- technically, but --",
  "There is -- there's another form of relief that --",
  "-- conceivably could give them a claim --",
  "-- and that's suspension of deportation --",
  "-- which is the same --",
  "But --",
  "Well, there's a lot in that question. Let me just try to address it one step at a time. With respect to whether it attaches new legal consequences, I think you were right, Justice Breyer, earlier, in asking about what would happen if he had gone back voluntarily. Now, it's true that if he had been removed, then there would have been the consequence, in the sense that there would be a period of inadmissibility, at least presumptive inadmissibility, a period, which, by the way, is subject to waiver, which he could apply for. But if he had just gone back voluntarily after IIRIRA's enactment, or, indeed, in the 6-month window between IIRIRA's enactment and IIRIRA's effective date, my understanding is that there would have been no presumptive period of inadmissibility.",
  "I think --",
  "I think that's correct.",
  "That's my understanding of the law.",
  "Well, the five -- the 5-year period that Petitioners -- Mr. Gossett was referring to, I think, relates to the period after the point in time at which somebody's deported or removed. And so, his initial deportation --",
  "He would --",
  "That's right.",
  "That's my --",
  "-- understanding.",
  "No, he -- you're right, Mr. Chief Justice, that it's -- that he's illegally reentered. But he wouldn't be covered by this provision, because all this provision seeks to do is to remove him. And then, once he's gone back, this provision simply ceases to have any relevance to him at all, because he's, in some sense, self-removed. And so, he -- any ineligibility wouldn't stem from this provision, it would come from somewhere else. And, as far as I'm aware, he wouldn't -- he wouldn't be subject to the 5-year period of inadmissibility that's imposed by a separate provision and that would attach if he were removed, because, by hypothesis, he wouldn't have removed, he would have gone back on his own accord.",
  "That's right. That's subject to waiver, which is another --",
  "Right. That's --",
  "That's discretionary --",
  "-- at the end of the day --",
  "-- as well.",
  "Right. And we lay this out in some detail in a -- in a footnote in our brief. And that's at -- that's at pages 39 to 40. But that footnote, I should point out, doesn't deal with your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, which is that he goes back of -- on his own accord. And, I think, in that situation what he would do is what people ordinarily do when they're seeking to gain lawful admission to the country, which is to apply for admission on the basis of what would have been whatever relationships he could have asserted at that point. Now, he wasn't married at the time that IIRIRA was enacted, so he wouldn't have used his marriage as a basis for coming in, because he wasn't married as of yet. But I think that cuts more against him, rather than in his favor, because --",
  "-- of course --",
  "It --",
  "That's right, Justice Ginsburg, it would count for purposes of suspension of deportation, which was renamed cancellation of removal. But that form of relief is available to somebody who's inside the United States, and I was meaning to address the situation where he has voluntarily removed himself from the United States and is seeking admission from, presumably, Mexico, in which case, suspension of deportation wouldn't really come into play, because deportation wouldn't be on the table. But, you're right that if he had stayed in the country, suspension of deportation is a form of relief that he would have been eligible for -- eligible for, pre-IIRIRA. But, with respect to suspension of deportation, I think it's important to understand that that form of relief required an -- a period of presence in the United States of 7 years before one could gain eligibility to seek that relief. And so --",
  "He --",
  "He was. So, he would have clearly met that eligibility criteria -- there is no question about that -- under the pre-existing law. But if you put yourself in the position of somebody who is entering, pre-IIRIRA, and is trying to determine whether suspension of deportation is relief that would be realistically available to them, you'd have to think that they would act on -- in reliance on their ability to stay in the country for 7 years, and to remain undetected, only at which point they would qualify for suspension of deportation. And that not only seems to me, as a factual matter, somewhat farfetched, but it's not clear that the law should attach significance to that sort of reliance --",
  "-- interest.",
  "As an -- as an empirical matter, I think that's right, Justice Ginsburg, but I'm not sure that that necessarily means that that's a legitimate expectation or a reasonable reliance interest of the type that the Court would typically take into account in its retroactivity inquiry, because at the end of the day what it is, is a reliance interest that's predicated on essentially lack of prosecutorial resources, or a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion in some sense. And the Court hasn't attached significance to that sort of reliance interest before. It's --",
  "That's right, and -- particularly taking into account the reasonable reliance -- the category \"reasonable reliance\" is designed to take -- is designed to --",
  "-- account for its fairness --",
  "-- interests.",
  "Right. I think the presumption --",
  "-- against retroactive --",
  "Well, the consequence of removal is more serious --",
  "-- than -- in some sense, than a $50 penalty. That's right. But this is a person --",
  "That's right, but --",
  "Sure. I think it affects anyone who had illegally reentered, at least. But it's important to bear in mind that this is somebody who was already subject to a removal order. So, in some sense, sending them back out of the country puts them in the same position that they would have been in under the old removal order. And so, insofar as it has that effect on them, I think it's different than a $50 penalty that attaches to the primary conduct of illegal reentry, as such.",
  "There is that suggestion, I think, in Judge McConnell's opinion, and that's --",
  "With the -- with the Tenth Circuit's theory or --",
  "I think --",
  "-- the idea was -- I think what the Tenth Circuit failed to recognize was that adjustment of status was categorically unavailable to somebody who illegally reentered before IIRIRA, at least before 1994. And what Judge McConnell presumed was that it would have been available. And his point was that even if it would have been available, it's farfetched to think that somebody would have thought not only about coming into the country, but coming into the country and then meeting a United States citizen, and become married to the United States citizen, and using that as sort of a reliance basis for not applying the law retroactively to somebody who had come in beforehand. But I think that was based on a misimpression about the availability of adjustment of status. Now, I'd like to address, briefly, if I could, the argument at step one of the Landgraf inquiry concerning the negative inference the Petitioner seeks to draw from the \"before or after\" clause -- so-called \"before or after\" clause. And the two provisions can be compared side by side at pages 2 and 3 of the Government's brief, and that's in the body of the Government's brief. The fundamental flaw with the argument at step one is that the \"before or after\" clause in the old provision, which is at the bottom of page 2, referred, by terms, to the date of the INA's enactment. Now, what we've reflected is the codified version, which refers specifically to the date of June 27 of 1952. But even the INA itself referred to the date of the enactment of this Act, which can only be seen to refer to the INA itself. So, if this language had been carried forward in section 1231(a)(5), it still would have been a reference to the date of the enactment of the INA. So, it would refer to somebody who was deported before or after 1952. Now, I think, as Justice Alito suggested, the probable reason that Congress decided not to carry forward this language is because the question of whether someone was deported before or after 1952 doesn't have a great deal of practical significance at this point in time. But whatever one might think was the actual reason for Congress's failing to carry forward the language, I don't think that you can draw any negative inference from Congress's failure to carry forward that language, at least certainly not the negative inference that Petitioner wants to draw. In fact, the negative inference that one would draw, if one were going to do so, is that the section 1231(a)(5) applies only to people who were deported initially after 1952. But that sort of negative inference wouldn't be of much assistance to Petitioner, or any other person, for that matter, that illegally reentered before IIRIRA, at least as a practical matter, because everybody, I think, in that category, would have illegally reentered -- or would have been deported after 1952, rather.",
  "Well --",
  "I -- it's -- there's certainly not enough there to make the argument that he's making, I don't think, because what was -- what Congress did was to replace that provision with utter silence. And from that utter silence, I don't think there's any way to read into it that Congress meant for the applicability of section 1231(a)(5) --",
  "That's right.",
  "That's right. I don't think there's any way to read into it the inference that Congress meant to hinge the applicability of section 1231(a)(5) on IIRIRA's enactment date. There never was a proposal on the table to hinge section 1231(a)(5)'s applicability on IIRIRA's enactment date. The only possibility was to keep the old provision in the statute books unaffected, and the decision not do that doesn't have the negative inference that Petitioner suggests. If the Court has no more questions --",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: An action to enforce the terms of a FEHBA contract is a Federal action because the rights and duties in FEHBA contracts are Federal in nature under the Jackson Transit inquiry. The Federal nature of the rights and duties comes both from the context in which FEHBA operates and also from the terms of the express preemption provision. Briefly --",
  "Well, I guess that seems like an unlikely outcome, given that under the express terms of the preemption provision, it's clear that the contract terms are matters of Federal law in the sense that Federal law dictates that they govern over State law. And if we know that Federal law provides a substantive rule of decision with respect to the construction of the contract, it seems anomalous to impute to Congress the intention that those Federal rights and duties should be litigated solely in a State court action.",
  "Well, they didn't do that, but I think as Jackson Transit explains, it's -- it's different in the contract context than in your standard implied cause of action context for the following reason. When Congress specifically contemplates the construction of contracts, as it did in FEHBA, it clearly contemplates that those contracts will be enforceable somewhere. So there is a cause of action for breach. The only question is whether that cause of action sounds in State law or instead in Federal law. And on that question, when Congress prescribes, as it did in the preemption provision, that the rights and duties are matters of Federal law, it seems most likely that Congress intended there would be a Federal cause of action that could be brought in Federal court to litigate those terms. And that's what Congress did in the terms of the preemption provision. That --",
  "Well, this is part and parcel of benefits, Justice Ginsburg, because you're right that when -- and when an employee asks for benefits, you'd expect that issue to be litigated in Federal court. But this is a condition on benefits. That's how the reimbursement obligation is framed in the contract. It's that if you get benefits from the Federal Government and then later on get the same benefits from a third party, a condition on the Government benefits is at that point you have to reimburse the Federal Treasury. So I don't think that one can easily draw a distinction between benefits qua benefits and benefits that are at -- at one point issued to the employee but then are subsequently returned pursuant to the terms of the reimbursement obligation.",
  "Well, do you mean in an underlying tort action or --",
  "No. In the underlying tort action, that generally would be governed by State law. Now, on the question of whether a benefit is something that the individual is entitled to or, conversely, whether the benefit is obligated to -- whether the individual is obligated to --",
  "I'm not sure --",
  "I -- I think that -- that when it's a claim for benefits, it probably would be governed by Federal law.",
  "But even --",
  "Well, it depends on whether the contract speaks to the issue. Now, insofar as the contract --",
  "-- insofar --",
  "-- insofar as the contract doesn't speak to an issue, there obviously would be a stronger argument for the operation of State law. But that's not --",
  "Not necessarily.",
  "Well, it -- it differs from ERISA in the following sense, that in ERISA, ERISA sets forth a cause of action. And so the Court has concluded that that cause of action is exclusive of State court causes of action. And we're not taking that position here. We -- we don't say that the Federal action is the only action -- excuse me -- that's available. State court actions for breach of contract might also be available. But --",
  "Well, I don't know that it's going to be a -- a terribly difficult inquiry because of the precision with which the terms of the preemption provision speaks. And it's certainly not difficult with respect to the reimbursement obligation because it fits --",
  "It has, but in terms of -- in terms of the relate-to requirement, that's true, and I think the Court would apply exactly the same standards that it applies in ERISA.",
  "I don't. I think --",
  "Well, I think Boyle somewhat stands for the same proposition in this --",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "Well, Boyle at least establishes that the terms of a contract preempted State law because it was a procurement contract and the idea was that by complying with the terms of the procurement contract, the contractor asserted essentially a federally compelled defense to the State court action.",
  "I don't know that there are other statutes, but what this particular -- particular provision indicates is that Congress thought it was very important that FEHBA contracts would control over State law, and I don't think there's any constitutional limitation on Congress' ability to do that. After all --",
  "But --",
  "That -- that --",
  "Absolutely that's constitutional, and that's -- that's what I mean to be saying because it's Federal law --",
  "No, they're not.",
  "On which particular --",
  "There's -- there's variation, sure. Now, on -- on --",
  "Well, there's -- it depends on what you're talking about.",
  "Well --",
  "The statute doesn't give a great deal of specific --",
  "-- direction on the terminology.",
  "It gives some, but it's only bare bones, Justice Breyer.",
  "But I think that's important because what -- what Congress has done is essentially to leave it to OPM to negotiate the terms of these contracts.",
  "Well, those --",
  "The contracts between the individual and the carrier are dictated by OPM in some sense because OPM negotiates the terms that bind the individual. So, the contract that you and I enter into when we sign on for health insurance is a part of the -- of the program, if you will, that's negotiated by OPM with the carrier.",
  "That's right, in negotiation with the carrier, and the statement of benefits is essentially the program. It tells you what benefits you're entitled to and it tells you what obligations you're encumbered by when you take on those benefits. And one of the obligations that you're encumbered by under the clear terms of this contract is the obligation to reimburse the carrier in the event --",
  "-- that you receive benefits and then subsequently receive benefits from a third party. And one thing that I don't want to lose sight of is that ultimately this concerns money that will be reimbursed to the Federal Treasury. And so the fact that this case happens to involve litigation between two private parties shouldn't obscure the strength of the Government's interest in the area, given that Federal funds are involved.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me begin by addressing this question of whether what's going on here is conflict preemption or field preemption. Now, it depends on how one defines those terms. But as we understand it it's conflict preemption, not field preemption, in the following sense. Our position is not that State laws have no application to operating subsidiaries or to national banks for that matter. It's that State laws apply to the same extent to operating subsidiaries as they would to national banks. And as this court has made clear in the Atherton case and in the Barnett Bank case, State laws do apply to national banks and operating subsidiaries in a variety of respects, and State contract law would be an example. But with operating subsidiaries in particular, State laws dealing with corporate governance questions, for example the process of incorporation, dissolution, shareholder voting, and things of that sort, would be controlling and so federal law doesn't control those sorts of aspects.",
  "Well, I guess it depends on the degree to which the regulations apply to the national banks. That's my only point, is that State laws apply to the same extent to the operating subsidiary as to the national bank.",
  "State agencies don't generally do that because there's a specific statutory prohibition on that. And Justice Scalia, this goes to your questions about the scope of these provisions at 12 U.S.C. 484(a) and 481. It's true that those provisions say by their terms that visitorial authority resides exclusively with the Comptroller of the Currency with respect to national banks, and there's another provision that deals with affiliates. And so that's the point with visitorial authority. But visitorial authority by its very nature is asserted in service of and enforcement of some underlying substantive requirement, and the underlying substantive requirement at issue here is the requirement that operating subsidiaries register with the State. And so there's a question of conflict preemption that applies both to the national bank and the operating subsidiary of whether that underlying substantive registration requirement could be applied to the national bank or could be applied to the operating subsidiary.",
  "Well, I don't know what you mean by \"holding company,\" Justice Stevens.",
  "That's right, because it wasn't an operating subsidiary of a federally chartered national bank.",
  "It is, but it's changing the corporate structure in a fundamentally important way. That's that it's no owned and controlled by a federally chartered national bank.",
  "Well, again it depends on how one defines those terms. And I don't take issue with the fact that as a consequence of the fact that this became a subsidiary - -",
  "That's right.",
  "Well, I don't have an empirical answer to that question.",
  "But Justice Stevens, in the regulatory materials that attended the promulgation of these rules OCC specifically addressed the question whether it had sufficient resources to exercise oversight authority over operating subsidiaries of national banks. And let's be clear. It's not that the OCC previously had no authority over operating subsidiaries. The question is whether the OCC has exclusive authority over operating subsidiaries. And the OCC determined in the regulatory materials that it had sufficient resources to exercise oversight authority over operating subsidiaries - -",
  "But that's because it wasn't an operating subsidiary of a federally chartered national bank, and that changes things in a fundamental way for the following reason: That under the Barnett Bank case the rule of preemption, the special rule of preemption that applies in the context of national banking, is that when you're dealing with enumerated or incidental powers of national banks -- and one incidental power of a national bank is undisputed to be the power to conduct affairs through an operating subsidiary -- that the grants of those powers are normally preemptive of rather than preempted by State law> And so once the operating - -",
  "Well, that was. But the Court - -",
  "But the Court's decisions aren't limited to prohibitions of that sort. I'd make two points in that regard. First of all, in one sense this is a prohibition, because the operating subsidiary can't engage in federally authorized activities unless and until it gets the State's permission. So at least there is a prohibition at the outset. But more importantly, the Court's cases aren't limited to situations involving prohibitions of the sort that Your Honor posits, because in the Franklin National Bank case that was a situation in which the national bank had the power to accept savings deposits and the State law that was deemed to be preempted there didn't prohibit the national bank from accepting savings deposits.",
  "No, not if you're talking about corporate powers, because those are governed by State law. What it could do, though, is regulate the subsidiary's conduct of the business of banking, because, after all, an operating subsidiary has one purpose and one purpose only, and that's to carry out functions that the national bank itself could perform.",
  "With respect, Justice Scalia, I don't think the statutes say that at all. There is a statute, 484(a), that says that the OCC's visitorial authority is exclusive with respect to national banks. But there is no statute that says that the OCC's visitorial authority is not exclusive with respect to subsidiaries. There's another statute that deals with affiliates. Now one point is that affiliates are not limited to subsidiaries, but they could include for example, I guess brother and sister corporations for lack of a better term, that are controlled by a common parent. But another point is that at the time these statutes were enacted, Congress simply didn't have within its field of vision the notion that a national bank would have the power to exercise its functions through a subsidiary corporation.",
  "Because what Congress was trying to do is to make sure that the OCC had exclusive visitorial authority with respect to the conduct of national bank function. It's just at the time that these statutes were enacted, the only play that national bank functions were being conducted was by a national bank itself. Now later on, when the laws of all 50 states, the OTS, the Federal Reserve with respect to state member banks, and the comptroller gives banks the authority to conduct national -- to conduct bank functions through its subsidiaries, then this issue arises about who exercises visitorial authority with respect to the conduct of those functions for a subsidiary. And it stands to reason that if the baseline rule is that with respect to the conduct of national bank functions through a national bank itself, the OCC visitorial authority is exclusive, then when a national bank exercises its Federal entitlement to conduct those very same functions through an operating subsidiary, the OCC's visitorial authority, likewise, would be exclusive. That seems to me to be an entirely reasonable regulatory determination by the comptroller, and there's nothing in those statutory provisions that speaks directly to that issue and that in any way precludes the comptroller from reaching that determination.",
  "Well, there could be. I don't know about this particular case but there absolutely could be, Justice Ginsburg, because when they become subsidiaries they are controlled by the national bank and not by some other entity. And the reason that a national bank would choose to engage in this sort of structure rather than folding the enterprise into the bank itself are many fold. And in part it's for efficiency purposes because you can have focused management, especially when you're dealing with the sort of specialized things that operating subsidiaries typically do. But there's also other reasons. For example, there's a modularity component to this in the sense that the best specialized functions such as mortgage lending, very often a national bank will purchase an entity that conducts that activity, and may be interested in selling the entity later, and it's much more straightforward to do that if those functions are maintained in a separate subsidiary corporation.",
  "Well, with respect to liability limitation in particular, Mr. Chief Justice, I should clarify that veil piercing principles and things of that sort would be governed by state law with respect to the operating subsidiary. So if the question is whether the corporate veil is pierced, state law would dictate an answer to that question. But, may I just finish one thought? States won't have an incentive to liberally construe veil piercing principles with respect to national banks precisely because state member banks in all 50 states also have operating subsidiaries through which they charter banks to conduct banking functions. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:",
  "Well, I don't think you need to stretch the language, Justice Scalia.",
  "Well, it depends on what you mean by stretch.",
  "The question, the question before the Court is whether the Secretary's formula is unambiguously foreclosed by the statutory test, not whether it's the better reading, but whether it's unambiguously foreclosed. And we happen to think it's the better reading, but we certainly think it's not unambiguously foreclosed. And maybe the clearest indication that Congress did not unambiguously foreclose the Secretary's methodology - -",
  "Well, Brand X says that, but it's a characterization of the step one inquiry under Chevron. And we can use \"foreclosed\" if you like, Your Honor. But the clearest indication that the statute does not foreclose the Secretary's methodology is a provision that I think hasn't been addressed thus far in the argument and that's that in the very same act in Congress in which Congress enacted Section 7709, the provision at issue here, Congress also explicitly endorsed and incorporated the Secretary's - -",
  "I am.",
  "I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice, with respect. There are two education finance incentive grant program, or EFIG, provisions that we identified in the briefs and one of them I would acknowledge is susceptible to that line of argument, although I don't think it's persuasive. But it's the other one that I'm focusing on, and what the other one does is to explicitly incorporate the Secretary's regulations and so what Congress said in 1994 is that for purposes - -",
  "They didn't, but I think it would be very odd to attribute to Congress the intention on one hand to say, we like your regulation, so much so that we want to use it and we want you to continue to use it for purposes of the EFIG program - -",
  "They're not - -",
  "They're not different purposes at all, Justice Scalia, with respect. They're the exact same purpose. In both programs what Congress wanted to do was to get an assessment of the extent to which education expenditures were equalized in a State among school districts. They're the very same purpose.",
  "Well, at that level of generality you might be right, but with respect to the purpose of the equalization provisions of both of those acts the purpose is exactly the same. In impact aid, just like in EFIG, the question is to what extent has the State equalized expenditures across school districts. It's the very same question.",
  "Well, because - -",
  "Well, they didn't mimic it. They incorporated it. And so far as the argument is that they incorporated just the regulation qua regulation and not the appendix to the regulation, I don't think that that argument can be squared with the statutory text or the regulatory text.",
  "I don't think so, at least not in the circumstance of this case, where the regulation by its own terms incorporates the appendix. And so when Congress incorporated the regulation it necessarily incorporated the appendix.",
  "No.",
  "No, I don't think so, Your Honor. The text of the statute in 1994 is set forth at the top of page 30 of the Government's brief, and I'm quoting from the second line of page 30 and what Congress said in the EFIG statute in 1994, again in the very same act that enacted this language - -",
  "In the EFIG statute.",
  "Well, it didn't take the part that said look to the appendix because I don't know that that would have been a sensible thing to do when you're enacting a statute. But the point I'm trying to make is that when Congress in the EFIG statute incorporated the regulation it specifically referred to the regulation that the Secretary had in place at that time.",
  "It didn't do that here, but it didn't have to. It makes sense - -",
  "Well, let me just make one more point on this, Your Honor, and then I'll move to the text of Section 7709, because I do think that this point has a great deal of force. The reason that Congress would have incorporated the regulation specifically in EFIG but not in impact aid is because we're dealing with an impact aid regulation. So the Secretary ordinarily wouldn't have thought that he should apply the impact aid regulation for purposes of EFIG unless Congress told him to do that and that's what Congress did. But with respect to impact aid, there's no reason to incorporate the regulation. The regulation already existed, and the question is did Congress in this act foreclose the Secretary from continuing to apply that longstanding regulatory methodology. And I would suggest that if Congress really wanted to - -",
  "Sure.",
  "Well, if you look at 2(a), Your Honor what that says is that the disparity, the disparity standard at its broadest level deals with whether the per-pupil revenues for the highest ranked local educational agency exceeds the per pupil revenues for the lowest one by 25 percent.",
  "It would make no difference if you take into account pupils for that part of the analysis, and here's the reason why. When you take into account pupils with respect to a local educational agency and you weight the local, the figure by the number of pupils served by the local educational agency, the per pupil figure that you're going to attach to each of those individual pupils is the same. It's the same per pupil figure for each one. It's just that you multiply it by the number of pupils. So for purposes of this part of the statute, where you're comparing the highest to the lowest, whether you took into account the number of pupils or not you'd still be dealing with the same two figures. You'd be dealing with a figure that applies to the highest ranked local educational agency and you'd be dealing with a figure that applies to the lowest ranked local educational agency.",
  "No, there would be -- I don't know that we use one or the other. It's just that there would be absolutely no purpose served by using pupils with respect to - -",
  "Well, no; especially because it makes no difference, because with respect to the B part of it, the 95th and 5th percentile exclusions, it makes all the difference in the world whether you take into account - -",
  "Effectively.",
  "Well, it's an approximation to be sure, and per-pupil revenues by definition deal with approximations across the swath of students that are covered by local educational agencies.",
  "Well, I think what we're really doing, Your Honor, is weighting each figure by the amount of pupils in the school district, and the reason we're doing that is to get a more accurate picture of the extent to which any one school district's per-pupil revenue figure contributes to the overall revenue pictures in the State. And if I could use one example which I think might help to crystallize why it's necessary to do this sort of weighting and why education finance practitioners routinely prescribe that you have to do this sort of weighting in order to avoid distorted results, if you consider the example of a State that has two school districts, and I'll use real examples from New Mexico. One would be the district that has the highest per-pupil revenues in the state, the Mosquero district, in which there's 57 pupils. And the other would be the Albuquerque school district, the largest school district in the State, which serves 84,000 pupils. Now the per-pupil revenues for Albuquerque are roughly $3,000 and the per-pupil revenues for Mosquero, the smaller school district, are roughly $7,000. And if you imagine a State that consists of just those two districts, and you ask the question to pair with the statutory language, what is the 50th percentile, and I'll use 50th just for ease of analysis, what is the 50th percentile of such per-pupil revenues in the State? One answer would be that you take the number for Mosquero, the 7,000 and you take the number for Albuquerque, the 3,000, you split the difference and you say the 50th percentile of per-pupil revenues in the State is $5,000. But I think that would present a very misleading picture of what's actually going on in the State.",
  "Because - -",
  "I don't -- I -- it is not --",
  "One.",
  "Hawaii. Hawaii has one which is a special case but there are states that have a relatively small number of school districts.",
  "Two points on (b)(ii), Mr. Chief Justice. The first is that by -- by the statutory text, (b)(ii) is over and above what you do in (b)(i,). The 95th and 5th percentiles exclusions. So you first have to do that. But the more relevant point - -",
  "No, my point is simply that under (b)(i) the statute says the Secretary shall disregard local education agencies that are above the 95th and below the 5th percentile. So I think the Secretary has to do that. Now (b)(ii) in some sense could be seen as an additional option for the Secretary over and above the exclusion, but there is a more fundamental point which is that with (b)(ii), it says take into account the extent to which a program of State aid reflects the additional costs. And so what that does is a piggyback on the way that the State approaches the situation. So this, as -- this provision as the Secretary understands it allows it to give effect to a State that gives effect to those sorts of considerations, but it's not an independent grant of authority for the Secretary himself to take those considerations into account.",
  "No. No. Absolutely not.",
  "Sure, I will. It's at page 4a of the appendix of the Government's brief, b -- (b)(i). And what the text says is disregard local educational agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues above the 59th percentile or below the 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the State.",
  "Now one point I make - -",
  "Yes.",
  "You identify the agencies to be disregarded by first identifying the 59th and 5th percentiles of per-pupil revenues in the State. And then you disregard - -",
  "Yes, but -- and -- but the critical test is the 95th percentile and 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the State.",
  "It is. I mean there is no doubt that the per-pupil revenues or expenditure figures that lie on the spectrum are associated with the local educational agencies. That's how - -",
  "I don't think so. The - -",
  "Well, that's true that each local education agency has a per-pupil expenditure or revenue. But the critical part of the statute which has 59th percentile or 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues doesn't foreclose weighting. And I think the point that Justice Alito made bears, which is - -",
  "Well, we -- two parts to the answer, Justice Souter. First the Secretary's formulation, no less than Petitioner's formulation, does disregard local educational agencies with per-pupil revenues above the 95th and 5th percentiles.",
  "Where we disagree is in identifying the 95th exactly.",
  "Exactly. And I'd - - exactly. And I'd reiterate the point that Justice Alito made earlier, which is that Congress could have compelled the approach that Petitioners compelled - - contend, if it would have said - -",
  "Well, I think it does, Your Honor, because there are two different ways of ranking the LEAs. One is to take the per-pupil revenues associated with each LEA and simply take that list into account. Another is to take the same list but then weight it by the number of pupils in each LEA.",
  "Nothing in the statute forecloses that approach.",
  "Because the text refers to the 95th and 5th percentiles of such expenditures or revenues in the State, and the list that includes the weighting does represent a list of expenditures or revenues in the State.",
  "Sure. And I don't, I don't dispute that the per-pupil revenue figures belong to a local educational agency. But again that doesn't mean that you can't take into account the relative extent to which a particular school district contributes to the overall State picture, and the way you do that - -",
  "Well, it is, it is a ranking of LEAs in the first instance and then it's, each of those LEA figures is weighted by the number of pupils the way we do it, and we do end up disregarding LEAs. But as Justice Souter pointed out the first step is identifying the 5th and 95th percentiles, and on that step we take into account the number of pupils. It's only at that step that we take into account the number of pupils.",
  "And nothing in the statute forecloses that. I'm sorry.",
  "Well, one way or another I think your should rule in our favor.",
  "Well, I think in that situation you sort of have the sliding scale that we often confront with textual analysis. And if you really think that Congress would have compelled an absurd result, and I think it does verge on that, then you would - -",
  "Well, if the language absolutely unambiguously compels that reading, then I think it would be a difficult position. But I don't think it goes, goes to that degree.",
  "Well, that's why I said, if you think that the statute unambiguously actually compels that reading, then I don't know that we would have a position.",
  "It says - -",
  "That's right.",
  "Well, well it's just the number of cards, ultimately, under your hypothetical, Justice Breyer.",
  "They have the same cards, we just have -- they have the numbers, exactly.",
  "It's the same cards with the same numbers. We just add more cards in order to reflect the extent to which each LEA contributes to the overall picture.",
  "I'm not sure I understand.",
  "Sorry.",
  "Sure.",
  "I think that's right, Justice Ginsburg.",
  "Well, as we point out in a footnote in our brief there was some education finance experts that suggested there would be no reason to retain the exclusion at the bottom of the range, and I think that's because when you have low per-pupil revenues there is a reason not to exclude those figures. But the important point is the material important part of the language, which is 95th percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the State, is exactly what the Secretary proposed and the Secretary of course wouldn't have curtailed his own discretion to continue the same methodology that he had long had in place. Thank you.",
  "In 2.A, 2.A calls for a different type of comparison. And I also note that in 2.A it refers to percent instead of percentile, which refers to two numbers being compared. Percentile refers to an entire ranking of value, so the processes are somewhat different. Now we're not, I'm not contending that this statute is absolutely clear and a model of draftsmanship, but certainly the meaning of 95th percentile or 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues is a broad enough term.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: An action to determine whether property taxes are owed is not a case in which rights of immovable property are an issue, and it's not transformed into such a case by attaching a lien, and recharacterizing the case as one to determine the validity of the lien. And I'd like to begin by picking up, Justice Ginsburg, on the question you just asked, because I think it's very important to emphasize that under Respondent's lien-based theory, that theory has the potential largely to eviscerate the other exceptions in the FSIA in the following sense: Respondent's theory doesn't turn in any way on the nature or source of the debt that's secured by the lien. So under Respondent's view, the fact that this case involves a debt that arises out of property taxes is largely beside the point. The load bearing weight of that theory rests entirely on the supposed effects of the lien on the property. And so for example, you could have a case in which a commercial activity is brought into play, where the plaintiff sues a foreign sovereign for commercial activity that occurs - -",
  "Well, the lien wouldn't constitute a right in the property, and that's consistent with what -- the way this Court has always described liens. As we point out in pages 21 and 22 of our brief, the Court has said - -",
  "The lien would not be enforceable against a foreign sovereign, because -- at least with respect to the immovable property.",
  "We are only talking about the immovable property exception. And with respect to that exception, this Court has expounded that a lien on land constitutes no property or right in the land itself. And it said that on more than one occasion.",
  "Well, we, of course, reviewed our position in that case, and we have come to the conclusion that it was incorrect. And in the Englewood case, that argument was the third argument in the brief. The first two arguments in the brief were more along the lines of the Court of Appeals decision.",
  "I don't - -",
  "Well, let me try to take up some of those in order. First with respect to the question of whether holders of a lien are entitled to compensation in eminent domain, we don't take issue with the proposition that a lien is property. A lien is property, but the question under the statute is whether a lien confers a right in the underlying immovable property. And so in an eminent domain proceeding it may just be that just compensation is owed to a lien holder because to the extent that the eminent domain proceeding takes that lien there's compensation owed for that property. But that doesn't - -",
  "Well, it's - -",
  "Well, I think - -",
  "Well, I don't think it's a right in property, Justice Scalia. The lien is a species of property, of intangible personal property, in the same sense that a cause of action would be, because after all what a lien is is essentially at bottom a claim.",
  "Well, a lien holder can bring an action to enjoin waste, but it's important to understand what interest the lien holder is protecting in that situation. An action for waste by a lien holder is to protect the security interest. It's different from an action for waste by someone who holds a right in the property. And New York law appears to recognize this because New York I think has two species of waste actions, one brought by a security interest holder and one brought by the holder of property rights. There's a case, Travelers Insurance, in which the Second Circuit reviewed New York law in this matter -- it's at 14 F.3d 114 -- and describes how there's two species of waste actions depending on which sort of plaintiff you have in issue. And that recognizes that the interest, if you will, that a lien holder has in the property, is different from a right in the property.",
  "Well, I don't -- you'd have to ask Respondent's counsel exactly what they mean by that.",
  "Because Respondents have repeatedly indicated in this case and in the court of appeals and in this Court that they can't foreclose on the property and so they've abandoned any claim for foreclosure. And a foreclosure action wouldn't result in the property being deeded to Respondent. It would be put up for sale and a third party would purchase it. So I'm not -- I can't tell you exactly what that paragraph means.",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, I think liens generally constitute clouds on title, but the fact that something's a cloud on title doesn't make it a right in the property. And I could give you one other example.",
  "I think our arguments apply equally both to the lien holder and to the property owner, Justice Scalia, in the following sense, that with respect to both of them a lien -- the lien doesn't affect rights of possession, it doesn't affect the right to exclude others, which this Court has characterized as the most fundamental of property rights. It doesn't affect the right to receive income from the property.",
  "Well, it has a practical consequence on conveyance because it, as Justice Ginsburg said, amounts to a cloud on title. But there are other instruments that result in a cloud on title but that wouldn't be considered rights in property. One example would be a contract, a purchase option contract to purchase property. The holder of a purchase option wouldn't be considered to have a right in the property unless and until the option was exercised. At least that's the general rule, even though the purchase contract in a sense constitutes a cloud on the title in the same way that a lien might constitute a lien on the title.",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "Well, I'm not aware that we took the position before the Englewood brief, so I think that would be 1985. And I don't think we've had occasion to revisit that position until this case. And let me point out with respect to the Englewood brief, the first two points made in that brief were along the lines of the court of appeals reasoning in this case, which was to the effect that a statute that refers to a right in immovable property encompasses obligations arising out of immovable property. And Respondent doesn't attempt to defend that position, but that's the predicate on which our Englewood brief rested. And so we think there's good cause for us to revisit our position from that case. Now, with respect to the question of whether a lien establishes rights in property, which is now the focus of Respondent's argument, I would point out that in other areas of the law the Court has looked to questions concerning whether there is a right to exclude others, whether there is a right to obtain income from the property, whether there is a right to assert possession of the property. That's, for example, the types of considerations this Court takes into account in the tax area in assessing whether a Federal tax lien can attach to a property by virtue of the fact that there is a right to property at stake. And we think the same sorts of consideration should inform the Court's assessment of the immovable property exception in this case.",
  "Well, an easement I think would qualify as a right in property because at least your standard easement would provide a right of access to the property by a thoroughfare. And so both sides would be affected in their use of the property in that sense.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A person who purchases a small quantity of drugs for his own personal use commits a misdemeanor, not a felony. The language of section 843(b) does not transform that person into a felon if he uses a phone in obtaining his drugs, rather than doing so strictly face to face. I would like to begin with the text of the statute before turning to the textual history and the statutory context. The language of section 843(b) covers the use of the phone in committing, in facilitating, or in causing a drug felony. That language presupposes someone who is causing, facilitating, or committing a drug felony, and with respect to such a person, it makes them guilty of an additional offense in the nature of an aggravated offense if they use a phone in their committing, facilitating, or causing a drug felony.",
  "It would depend on which prong you're referring to, Justice Ginsburg. The -- the committing prong refers to persons who are committing the underlying drug felony.",
  "And the facilitating prong would refer to persons who are aiding or abetting the underlying drug felony.",
  "She -- she may - -",
  "Well, I think I'm speaking first and foremost about the terms of the statute, Justice Kennedy. And to the extent she fits within the terms of the statute, it would be because she doesn't benefit from the buyer-seller rule. The buyer-seller rule establishes that buyers of drugs aren't aiders or abettors of the distribution of drugs, and equivalently they wouldn't be treated as facilitators of the distribution of drugs. Now - -",
  "Well, I think the classic case of somebody under the facilitating prong would be the classic aider and abettor, for example a lookout. If there were a lookout on the scene of a drug transaction, and they used the communication facility to communicate with the distributor to let them know that buyers were arriving or that law enforcement was in the neighborhood and the person ought to refrain from engaging in the transaction for the time being. That would be the sort of person that comes within 18 U.S.C. 2 as an aider or abettor of drug distribution and would come within 843(b) as a facilitator of drug distribution.",
  "Well, it deals with the use of a communication facility only with respect to persons that are committing, facilitating or causing a drug felony.",
  "No, I don't think it's a jurisdictional hook. There would already be Federal jurisdiction by virtue of the underlying felony, and so what Congress was concerned with in penalizing the use of a phone as in the nature of an aggravated offense is that I think Congress thought that phones were being used to make detection of drug trafficking more difficult, and in particular at the level of someone who was at top of the food chain in the architecture of a drug distribution chain, that person was able to avoid detection because they never came into physical contact with drugs and they didn't come into physical contact with the persons who were engaging in the transaction on the street.",
  "Right.",
  "No, I don't -- our argument doesn't depend on assuming that cell phone usage was significant in the 1970s. Even in 1970 the statute would exclude from its sweep buyers of drugs.",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "Well, if you agree with it --",
  "I'm not aware of a case that speaks directly to that question, Mr. Chief Justice. But our argument doesn't depend on that logic, because even in 1970 certainly land lines were well in use, and in fact the indications are that that's what Congress was principally concerned with in this statute. And at that time we would make the argument, just as now, a person who used the telephone in buying drugs for personal use wouldn't come within the ambit of the provision because the text of the provision goes to someone who uses a phone in committing, in facilitating, or in causing the commission of a drug felony. And so if you're not someone who's facilitating the commission of a drug felony in the first place, then you can't be charged as using a phone in facilitating a drug felony. The reason that a buyer for personal use, whether we're talking about 1970 or now, wouldn't be considered a person who is using a phone in facilitating a drug felony is because of the buyer-seller rule. Buyers aren't aiders and abetters of the felony distribution, and by the same token they shouldn't be considered facilitators of felony distribution.",
  "For several reasons, Your Honor. First, their definitional equivalence. Black's Law Dictionary defines \"facilitating\" as \"an act of aiding or helping or making easier,\" and it in turn defines \"aiding and abetting\" as \"to facilitate the commission of the crime.\" So they mean the very same thing. And I don't think there's anything talismanic about the particular formulation \"aiding and abetting\" and in fact the Court established that in its opinion in Gebardi. That dealt with the Mann Act, which barred transporting a woman for purposes of engaging in immoral acts or aiding or assisting in that transportation or causing the transportation. So that statute uses a different formulation - -",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, I don't know -- the opinion doesn't stand on the rationale that the woman would be a victim. It stands on the rationale that Congress when it defined the primary offense, which is transporting - -",
  "Well, it doesn't use the word \"purchase,\" with respect, Justice Kennedy. It uses the words \"commit, facilitate or cause.\" Those are the three persons who come within section 843(b). And in precisely parallel fashion, under 18 U.S.C. 2, a general aider or abettor provision, that provision applies to persons who commit the underlying offense, who aid or abet the underlying offense or who cause the underlying offense. And that precisely parallel structure reinforces that facilitating in 843(b) serves the same purpose and means the same thing as aiding or abetting and the other words that apply in section - -",
  "I don't think that's a distinction that ultimately makes a difference, Justice Kennedy, for the following reason. This statute does deal both with someone who is involved in the underlying felony and use of the phone on top of that, but it's in the nature of an aggravated offense. It presupposes somebody who is committing, causing or facilitating the underlying drug offense, and then it makes them guilty of an aggravated offense if they use a phone in the course of doing so. So the first question you'd have to ask is whether the person is committing, facilitating or causing the drug felony in the first place. And if I could use one hypothetical statute to illustrate that. If this statute, instead of saying facilitating, dealt by terms with use of a phone in aiding or abetting a drug felony, you would still have use of the phone in addition to the underlying drug felony. But the first question I think one would ask in looking at that provision is whether the person who's accused of violating the law were aiding or abetting a drug felony.",
  "I don't know that there are other provisions that would create a similar oddity. I think this one is particularly anomalous, the use of a statute to penalize somebody who otherwise would be a misdemeanant, except that they use a phone in the course of the purchase for personal use. The classic situations in which the statute does apply which aren't anomalous because they make sense given what Congress had in mind, would be the use of a phone to facilitate drug distribution, if someone were a lookout again or if someone were a trafficker and they instructed, for example, retail sellers where to go to pick up stock, a stock house of drugs.",
  "Well, two steps to respond to that question, Mr. Chief Justice. First, in terms of whether it makes it easier, I think one could say the very same thing in an aiding or abetting prosecution. Aiding or abetting means the same thing as facilitating, and so you could make the argument, I think, that buying drugs and engaging in the sorts of actions that naturally accompany the purchasing enterprise make the sale easier, including directing where the sale is going to occur and things like that. But we know already that buyers of drugs aren't considered aiders and abettors of drugs for purposes of liability under 18 U.S.C. 2. And I think by the same token they shouldn't be considered facilitators of drugs for purposes of section 843(b), and with respect -- I'm sorry?",
  "I don't think so, Justice Alito. I probably would have to know more about exactly what they did, but if it is a -- if what they did is a normal incident of purchasing, then I think it would fall within the buyer-seller rule. Otherwise, I think the government under an 18 U.S.C. 2 prosecution for aider and abettor liability could make precisely the same sorts of arguments. The government could argue, for example, that this person didn't just buy drugs. They instigated the purchase because they made the first phone call. They didn't accept the first phone call. They made the first phone call, and so that takes them outside the buyer-seller rule. But I don't that argument would work under 18 U.S.C. 2 because making the first phone call is a normal incident of purchasing. And, of course, someone who purchases drugs for personal use is going to want to take measures to make sure that the purchase goes through. Their ultimate objective is to get their hands on the drugs. And so - -",
  "That's -- that's right, Justice Ginsburg. It would apply equally in that situation, and from our perspective that points up even more of the anomaly in applying it to this factual context. And that would equally be the case under 18 One could draw distinctions between who makes the initial phone call and other sorts of normal incidents of the purchasing enterprise. But I don't think, Justice Alito, that because someone engages in a drug -- in -- in a transaction in a way that makes it particularly likely that the purchase is going to be successful, that that alone would take you outside the buyer-seller rule.",
  "No, I don't think so, because the buyer-seller rule deals with the circumstance in which the way the person is -- is associated with a felony is they're associated with the distributor's felony. And so what the buyer-seller rule says is that a buyer isn't an aider and abettor of the seller's distribution, and I think by the same token shouldn't be associated with the seller's facilitation. But in your hypothetical, where the buyer himself is committing a felony because his possession because of certain characteristics associated with it make it a felony, the buyer himself would be committing a felony.",
  "Right, couldn't be convicted of facilitating the seller's felony, but would fall within the ambit of section 843(b) in any event because they would have used the phone in connection with their own felony.",
  "I -- I don't know about that, but -- but I think what I do know is it doesn't create any greater problems of application than already exist under Federal drug laws. Because the Federal drug laws bar both possession for personal use under the civil possession statute, section 844, and possession with intent to distribute under 841. And so courts and juries and the government already have to make those sorts of decisions, and I don't know that they've been particularly difficult to make. They have to draw a distinction between the sorts of quantities and other aspects of the offense that bring it within the possession with intent to distribute plan or whether the possession is of such a small quantity, and there aren't other associated characteristics of the offense that make it possession for purposes of personal use. That distinction is one that's already embedded in the fabric of the drug laws, and we're just applying the same distinction for purposes of this statute. I don't think we're making it any more complicated than it already is.",
  "Well, it's -- it's definitely within the rule of lenity, and I think that's the principal place that it's found.",
  "And I don't -- I don't -- I don't know of any background principle that one would bring to bear on that other than the -- the normal tools of statutory construction that I've already talked about in the first place, which is you look at the text, and you look at the statutory history, and you look at the statutory context.",
  "Well, I think as - -",
  "Well, I think as a general rule we ought to be circumspect about doing that. My - - my understanding is that circumspection is given voice through the rule of lenity. But a background principle of particular applicability here is the statutory history, is the statutory history. And I'm speaking now in terms of the enacted statutory text; not legislative history, but the history of the enacted statutory text. And what that bears on is not the word \"facilitating,\" which is what the buyer-seller rule particularly pertains to, but the word \"felony,\" which is another word in the text of the statute. And so Congress could have barred the use of a phone in connection with any drug offense, including a drug misdemeanor, but Congress pointedly didn't do so. It barred the use of a phone in connection only with a drug felony. And because it chose to limit the offense to the use of a phone in connection with a drug felony, the effect is to exclude from the purview of the statute use of a phone in connection with a drug misdemeanor. Now, Petitioners - -",
  "That's right, Justice Ginsburg. Before the Controlled Substances Act, the communication facility provision barred the use of a phone in connection with any drug offense. And in 1970 in the Controlled Substances Act Congress narrowed its reach to encompass only use of a phone in connection with a drug felony. So it excluded use of a phone in connection with a drug misdemeanor, and that's significant in two respects. One is, even without reference to the statutory context of the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, it's significant because Congress excluded use of a phone in connection with a drug misdemeanor. Petitioner used a phone in connection with his misdemeanor simple possession. But under the government's argument, the very same conduct by the very same person would be brought back into the fold of the statute. Even though Congress excluded it, it would be brought back into the fold of the statute by recasting it as facilitating the dealer's felony. And the mode of analysis the Court used in Gebardi and the mode of analysis that underlies the buyer-seller rule to begin with would -- would lead us not to infer that Congress would have intended that result. But in terms of the history and the statutory context which you were alluding to, Justice Ginsburg, it is significant for that reason, as well, because the context in which Congress narrowed the reach of section 843(b) so that it only encompasses facilitation of a felony and not facilitation of a misdemeanor is one in which Congress in the 1970 act sought to extend leniency and afford a chance at rehabilitation to drug users. And that's manifested not in legislative history but in the statutory text itself, because Congress penalized simple possession for personal use as a misdemeanor, whereas, the receipt of drugs previously was a felony, regardless of the purpose of the possession, whether it was for use or for distribution. But Congress did more than that, because in immediately adjacent provisions to the one in which it narrowed simple possession to a misdemeanor, it also enacted a provision which is now found in 18 U.S.C. 3607, which allowed a simple possessor who is a first-time offender to avoid any conviction at all if they successfully complete a period of probation. And Congress went further still because it also enacted in another adjacent provision further relief for first-time simple possessors under the age of 21. With respect to that person, it allowed the person to obtain a complete expungement of the criminal records associated with the arrest.",
  "Well, the basis - -",
  "Yes. Before 1970 it would have been a very difficult climb because -- not only because the communication facility applied to any drug offense, but because simple possession wasn't a misdemeanor.",
  "It -- it wasn't sub silentio. It was explicit.",
  "No, well, it's in part because of the changes in this section. This section changed from \"any offense\" to \"felony,\" so it's the text of this section itself. And the buyer-seller rule equally applied in -- before 1970. It's just that before 1970 you wouldn't have had to show that the buyer was associated with the seller's felony, because the buyer was associated with his own offense and that was enough, because at that point the buyer's offense was a felony. And then the law, section 843(b), didn't care whether it was a felony because it applied to any drug offense. It's only after 1970 that this distinction becomes important, because after 1970 it's clear that the buyer for personal use doesn't use a phone in committing a drug felony. What he's committing is a drug misdemeanor. So you have to find some way, if you're the government, to make him associated with the drug felony. And to say that - -",
  "Right, which is the only avenue available after 1970. There was a different avenue available before 1970, because before 1970 a purchaser of drugs would, if they used a phone in connection with their purchase, would have used a phone in connection with a drug offense, and now the statute is different in two respects. One, it only covers use of a phone in connection with a drug felony; and two, in another provision, Congress narrowed the simple possession offense from a mis -- from a felony to a misdemeanor. And Congress did so with respect to the historical context in immediately adjacent provision. It narrowed 843(b) in an immediately adjacent provision to the one in which it provided that the simple possessor could avoid any conviction at all and the one in which it provided that a youthful offender could obtain a complete expungement of its records. And - -",
  "No, we don't question that, Your Honor, but I would like to make two points with respect to that. First of all, it may be more difficult -- the use of the telephone may be more difficult, and that may be the animating purpose that Congress sought to address through this provision. But that purpose is substantially served even in the context of this case, because - -",
  "Use of a phone may make detection more difficult, and that may be the animating purpose -- excuse me. That may have been the animating purpose behind the enactment of this provision. But that purpose is substantially served, even if you accept our understanding of the statute on the facts of this case, because the seller comes squarely within the terms of section 843(b). So because the seller comes within the terms of section 843(b), the statute is already operating against the seller's use of a telephone. The question in our case is whether the buyer also comes within the ambit of section 843(b). And because section 843(b) presupposes someone who is committing, facilitating or committing a drug felony, the buyer doesn't come within the reach of section 843(b) because he's not committing, causing or facilitating a drug felony in the first place. The seller may be, but the buyer is not. The statutory purposes are still served by virtue of penalizing the seller. If the Court has no further questions, I would like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The only point I would make in closing, unless the Court has further questions for us, is that we think the statutory text, the statutory history, and the context all weigh in favor of our reading. But even if there is any ambiguity on the matter, principles of lenity would squarely apply in foreclosing an interpretation that converts someone who is a misdemeanant into someone who is exposed to multiple felony counts carrying substantial criminal consequences.",
  "I don't think so, Justice Stevens, because as of 1970 there were already underlying drug laws that barred distribution, that barred receipt of drugs, and that barred most of the activities that are now prohibited under the drug laws. And the telephone law presupposes that one of those underlying acts is already going on. And so to the extent that there was jurisdiction over those underlying acts, which presumably there was since the statutes are on the books, the Telephone Act wasn't necessary to create jurisdiction.",
  "Well, I think the -- the use of the machine gun wouldn't come within the buyer/seller rule because what the buyer/seller rule deals with is a substantive prohibition on distribution. And the -- the presumption is that when Congress prohibits distribution, it knows that there is also a receiver of the banned substance. And by virtue of excluding that receiver from the distribution prohibition, it wouldn't have wanted to bring that receiver back within the fold of the statute.",
  "That wouldn't apply - -",
  "I was just going to say I don't think that would apply with somebody who is using a machine gun because the person who is using a machine gun isn't necessarily part of the distribution offense to begin with. And so the buyer/seller principle would apply with respect to the underlying purchase of drugs if that were at issue. But if you tack on use of a machine gun, I don't think the buyer/seller principle would speak directly to that.",
  "Oh, no, I'm sorry, Justice Alito. If the hypothetical statute barred use of a phone in facilitating a drug felony, if it was precisely parallel to this one, then we make the same argument. But it's not because the use of a machine gun falls within the buyer/seller principle. It's because the underlying act of purchasing drugs falls within the buyer/seller principle. And if the prohibition is on use of a machine gun in some underlying act, then you have to look at the underlying act. And the underlying act is governed by the buyer/ seller principle, and buyers fall outside of it. And so the use of a machine gun by someone who is already outside of the act wouldn't bring the buyer back into the fold of the statute.",
  "It would be the same - -",
  "If the -- if the statute - - if I understand your hypothetical correctly, if the statute were use of a phone in facilitating a drug felony, then the - -",
  "Sure. If that were the case, then it would be different. My -- if I could just finish for a minute, Mr. Chief Justice. My -- my only point is that if the theory of prosecution were that a person comes within the fold of the statute because they're buying drugs and that buying of drugs facilitates the sale of drugs and, therefore, they are someone who uses a machine gun in facilitating the sale of drugs, well, then the buyer/seller rule would kick in. Because the initial predicate of that theory, which is that the person is facilitating the sale by buying, wouldn't work. They would fall outside of the statute at that stage.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When the district court issued its initial judgment in 2000, what the court found was that there was a systemic violation of the EEOA. And the court further found that the program deficiencies were the result of the lack of funding rationally related to the programs.",
  "Justice Scalia, just one point of clarification on -- in our view on what the EEOA requires, and then I will address the No Child Left Behind point. The EEOA doesn't really require good faith efforts. It requires efforts that are in fact reasonably calculated to overcome language barriers.",
  "With that -- With that clarification, thank you.",
  "With that clarification on the question of whether No Child Left Behind sets the standard for compliance with the EEOA, which is, I think, what the petitioners' position is, we think the answer is no for two fundamental reasons. First is just a textual point. The text of No Child Left Behind doesn't say anywhere that it displaces the standards for compliance with the EEOA.",
  "I think their argument at the end of the day, Justice Scalia, is that if you comply with No Child Left Behind -- and I will get to in a moment what compliance with No Child Left Behind can mean -- then you have necessarily complied with the EEOA. That compliance with the No Child Left Behind sets the standard for compliance with the EEOA. And I don't think that is workable particularly when you take into account what petitioners mean by \"compliance with No Child Left Behind.\"",
  "Well, I -- I don't know that that is a correct interpretation of the EEOA. What we would say is that if the State came forward with a showing that completely regardless of funding the programs on the ground work, well, that would be something that the district court would have to take into account. But the state hasn't - -",
  "The Ninth Circuit focused on funding, Justice Alito, because that is the way the case has been litigated from the outset. And that's the way the State has said from the outset that it would achieve compliance with the - -",
  "Well, I think the Ninth Circuit was -- was required certainly to review the district court's inquiry into that. And what the district court found is at page 100-A of the appendix to the petition filed by the legislative intervenors. And what the district court found there is that the improvements today, although significant, failed to reach the high school; that they were fleeting. And - - and this is particularly significant. In addition, the district court also explained that it was premature to make an assessment of many of the changes, because many of the new standards are still evolving. And the reason the district court said that is that -- is because of the enactment in 2006 of Arizona HB 2064, which changes the framework for administration and funding of ELL programs in a way that I think fortifies the district court's denial of complete dissolution of its judgment and -- and ensuing orders.",
  "Yes, that - -",
  "There is nothing wrong with that, and it should be looked at. And the district court did look at it, and what the district court found was that the claims of progress, although there had been progress, the progress hadn't reached the high school. The progress was fleeting and that it was premature - -",
  "Well, the district court didn't issue that sort of order. And -- and the Ninth Circuit -- if you look at page 66a -- it did review the evidence in the record and fortified the district court's conclusion that the new plan, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, that was presented, which is to the effect that, regardless of funding, we have made advances based on management improvements that should satisfy the statute. That was the claim that was made by Petitioners. I think that's what you're alluding to. And the district court rejected that at page 100a, and the Ninth Circuit fortified the district court's rejection of it by looking at the evidence in the record concerning - -",
  "It's at 66a. That the court of appeals reviews the testimony and fortifies the district court's conclusion that, based on the advances to date, there's still work left to be done. Because at the end of the day you have to have a plan in place.",
  "Well, there's two fundamentally different assertions being made by Petitioners, if I understand it: One is what Justice Scalia alluded to earlier, which is that No Child Left Behind changed the legal landscape in a way such that compliance with No Child Left Behind, such as it is, sets the standard for compliance with the EEOA. Now, there's a distinct argument that's also being made which is that conditions on the ground have improved as a consequence of management improvements. Regardless of No Child Left Behind, this is a factual argument, that factually things have changed in a way that ought to let us from underneath the district court's supervision. Now, the -- they are different points, and I think the district court addressed both of them. With respect to the second one, where there is the facts on the ground, what is critical is that, in order to justify complete dissolution in a case like this, the Petitioners would have to show, not only that conditions have improved, but they have improved in a way that is durable and sustainable over time. And the district court - -",
  "-- doubted that.",
  "No, I don't think the EEOA requires raising everyone. I think it requires - -",
  "Well - -",
  "Well, that's part of what it says, and I think what the Ninth Circuit is also alluding to with respect to the high school in particular that, if you look at State survey that Petitioners rely on in -- in touting the improvements in certain schools, it also with respect to the high school shows that the two high schools in Nogales was ranked - - were ranked at the very bottom of the survey for ELL students. So there's problems on the ground, but what the district court focused on concerns the enactment of 2064, which is that no matter was think about the improvements that have -- that have been made to date, the landscape fundamentally shifts upon the enactment of 2064 because the administration and funding of ELL plans changes at that point. And it's - -",
  "I -- I think we would agree because that sets the charter for provision of programs to ELL students going forward from its enactment. That's the infrastructure from -- from here on out. And that -- there's three particular features of that that I think are significant and that fortify the district court's conclusion that complete dissolution was unwarranted. The first is the one that was raised by Justice Souter, which is that whatever you think of the progress that has been made to date -- and the district court found that, while it was significant, it didn't suffice -- that changes from what can be brought to bear from here on out as half the resources that were available before, because that's the net effect of 2064. That's what the district court found, at pages 107 to 108a of the Petition Appendix. And when you have half resources to work with -- at the very least I think what the district court thought in saying that it was premature to make an assessment is that we have to have some period to assess what happens on the ground as a consequence - -",
  "-- of this new funding recipe.",
  "No, the -- the district - - the State would have to present that, Your Honor, and I don't believe the State to have done that so far. But the State would have to make the argument that funding constraints are inexistence in a way that doesn't allow us to -- to use one example -- to -- to put together an optimal program, and so here's the program that we want to put in place in - -",
  "-- jurisdictions.",
  "Well - -",
  "Justice Scalia, I think that that issue becomes largely an academic one for the following reason: that the reason that the State Attorney General made the acknowledgment that he did is that, under the Arizona State Constitution, funding decisions don't vary from district to district. So whatever funding menu is put into place in order to achieve compliance with the EEOA with respect to Nogales is going to be the same one that exists throughout the State.",
  "It's - -",
  "Well, it could be, but I don't think there's really much of a dispute that the statewide funding measure doesn't really affect what the State's going to do in this case, because - -",
  "No, absolutely not. Not - - certainly not in the abstract.",
  "I don't think it's a necessary conclusion of my argument, Justice Kennedy. I think it's a conclusion that rests on we are in this litigation in this particular context, given the Arizona Constitution's uniformity clause. It's as a consequence of that clause that this issue even arises. And I think the Attorney General - -",
  "Well, if the - -",
  "Well, if the litigation had come up in a different way, Justice Kennedy, such that it had always focused exclusively on what happened in Nogales, including the funding aspect of the case, but I think what would have been appropriate is that the district court would have inquired about what funding resources belong to Nogales in particular. And then what would have happened by operation of State law would be that, whatever the funding calculus with respect to Nogales, it would automatically apply across the State because of the Arizona Constitution's uniformity clause. Now, in this case, the litigation -- the complaint was assessed against the entire State, and the Attorney General accepted that, and I don't think at this point in time we can revisit that, particularly when it's largely an academic question given the uniformity clause - -",
  "Well, two points, Mr. Chief Justice, and first -- and I don't mean to quibble, but the Attorney General did contest the litigation at the outset. What happened is, after a judgment was issued against the State, then I think there was an acquiescence in the - -",
  "Well, sure, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think what the Court did in both Rufo and Frew is it accommodated those concerns, and it accommodated the interest in finality that comes from judgments, and the interests in allowing a different set of State officials to suggest new programs to make that suggestion to the district court. And it accommodated those in a way that requires a showing at the outset that there has been a significant change in facts or a significant change in law. And on - -",
  "The one that was outlined by this Court in Rufo.",
  "A significant change of facts or a significant change of law. And the - -",
  "Well, on page 49a they invoke the precise wording of this Court, cite Rufo for that proposition, and also - -",
  "Well, I -- I would give effect to the articulation of the standard in the standard review question section of the opinion. Of course you could remand if you felt that it was necessary, but I think the reason why the Ninth Circuit uses the language such as Your Honor found in 72a is that it has to be considered in the context of the nature of the violation and the nature of the relief sought. The violation was a systematic one; the relief sought is a complete dissolution of the judgment and ensuing order, and in that context I think it is fair to say that what is significant is more significant than what would be the case in -- for example, in Rufo, where what was sought was a relatively modest modification of the consent order concerning whether you would have single bunking or double bunking. Now on the question of whether there is in fact a significant change or significant change of facts or significant change in law, on No Child Left Behind, Justice Scalia, to return to the question that you asked, the reason that No Child Left Behind in our view doesn't displace the standard for EEOA is that Petitioner's standard is that as long as the State has an approved No Child Left Behind plan, which is true of all 50 States, that they necessarily satisfy the EEOA; and what that would mean is that even if a State didn't implement that plan, even if the State didn't -- didn't -- didn't have accountability measures that it in fact followed, that required school districts to achieve the annual measurement of progress that would be laid out in the plan -- notwithstanding all of that, a plaintiff would lack authority to come into the court and litigate his private cause of action under the EEOA and get a court order that requires the State to take appropriate action - -",
  "-- simply because the State will have had an approved plan.",
  "I -- I don't think so. Because - -",
  "The -- the No Child Left Behind Act doesn't -- it doesn't approve a particular program. What it imposes are voluntarily accepted funding conditions, and that includes - -",
  "No - -",
  "What the EEOA concerns are programs that are reasonably calculated to achieve overcoming language barriers.",
  "What No Child Left Behind concerns is, is there a testing program in place that calls for certain improvements in testing over time. As long as the plan describes the tests that will be taken and the progress that will be achieved or sought to be achieved over time, a plan will be approved. Now, even if the State doesn't achieve the plan -- the progress that is called for by No Child Left Behind - -",
  "Right.",
  "Right. It's about tests.",
  "And even if you don't make the progress -- and if I could finish this one point, Mr. Chief Justice. And it bears noting that the Nogales the progress called for No Child Left Behind hasn't been made in the last two years, according to the superintendent's web site. Even if you don't make that progress, there is no way under Petitioner's approach to vindicate the EEOA cause of action to obtain appropriate action. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The diversity statute deems a corporation a citizen of, quote, \"the State where it has its principal place of business,\" closed quote. The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that Petitioner Hertz is a citizen of California, even though Hertz is headquartered in New Jersey and conducts over 80 percent of its operations outside the State of California, and even though, under the court's approach, national corporations could regularly be deemed California citizens if they conduct operations in that State that are proportional to the State's population. The better reading of the statute, in our view, is that it points to the location of the corporation's headquarters, the site from which a corporation directs and controls all the company's operations throughout all of its locations. And that is particularly the correct reading when the statutory language is considered in light of two considerations. First, the strong preference for simplicity and ease of administration in jurisdictional rules; and second, Congress's purposes in 1958 to preserve diversity jurisdiction for corporations in 48 States and to deny access to diversity jurisdiction only in one State, the State where the corporation had its home or principal place of business. Now, with respect to the ordinary meaning of the statutory text, the critical phrase is \"principal place of business.\" And dictionary definitions of that term define the term \"principal place of business\" as corporate headquarters, and that is fortified by Federal and State laws, which also define the term as \"company's headquarters\" - -",
  "Sure.",
  "Right.",
  "We would, Your Honor. But let me -- let me start first with accepting Your Honor's premise, that in the situation of a multistate corporation with -- with diverse operations, the principal place of business would be the headquarters. Now, I take your point that there are situations in which the test may not seem so straightforward, but we think even in the -- the hypothetical that Your Honor posits, the better answer -- at least our first submission would be, the better answer is the headquarters would control. And that's for a couple of reasons. Although, again, the one exception that we would have to our rule is exactly Your Honor's hypothetical, and let me just bracket that. Now, the reason we think, first and foremost - -",
  "Sure. And let me -- let me - -",
  "Well, I -- well, we think first and foremost that the headquarters' role would apply even in Your Honor's situation, and I will get to that to the exception -- fashioning the exception in just one second - -",
  "No, absolutely, Justice Ginsburg. And we would certainly accept the resolution of the case in -- in that light. If the Court were to announce a rule that says, multistate corporations with diverse operations, the principal place of business in that situation is the headquarters, I think Your Honor is correct that certainly we would prevail under that and that would be entirely acceptable to us. But - -",

  "That's -- that's correct, Justice Scalia.",

  "Yes. And -- and that's why we would accept that result, Justice Ginsburg. We certainly would. Let me just put that out there first and foremost. Now, with respect to - -",
  "I don't know that I, in fact, started the answer, Mr. Chief Justice - -",
  "-- with respect. The answer is that even in that situation, for the reasons that Justice Scalia highlights, we would say that the headquarters controls. And let me give two -- two principal reasons why. The first is that even if the operations are in one State and the headquarters are in a different State, the headquarters still is where the direction and control comes from. And I think the ordinary meaning of the phrase \"principal place of business\" in that situation would still direct attention to the headquarters. And the dictionary definitions that we identified in -- in our brief and every Federal and State law that defines the term \"principal place of business\" defines it at headquarters -- as headquarters, without any exception for the hypothetical situation that Your Honor posits. But the other - -",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "Right. Your Honor, I think -- and that -- that is the sort of different set of questions which is other ambiguities with respect to the definition of a headquarters in certain situations. Now, by and large, the headquarters is relatively straightforward. It's made in public filings which are an easy place to look, and if you look at the experience of the Seventh Circuit, which of course has applied the headquarters approach across the board over the course of several decades, I think we can see that that test has been straightforward and it is simple in application, in the main. Now, that is not to say that there are not issues about the definition of headquarters at the outer perimeters. There are. And I think the place I would look first and foremost is: Where does direction and control for the corporation come from? That is the situs at which the headquarters would be found. And I would look also to what a corporation itself identifies as headquarters in public filings. In 10-K filings and under the Model Business Corporations Act, corporations have to report their headquarters in annual reports. And of course they are doing those reports for other reasons other than establishing jurisdiction in a particular case, so I think they come with an air of objectivity about them. That's where I would look. Now, I would make this other point, though, about the ambiguity that Your Honor points to with respect to the definition of a headquarters. That - - that is not at all an ambiguity that only applies to our test, because under Respondent's test and under the test of every court of appeals, they take into account the headquarters. Now, we would think that that is dispositive. The other courts consider it at least highly relevant, albeit not dispositive. But whatever ambiguities - -",
  "Well, first in a situation with a multistate corporation with dispersed operations, as we point out in footnote 2 of our reply brief, I think the courts of appeal are generally in agreement that the headquarters would control in that situation. Now, with respect to whether you would have an across-the-board headquarters rule, Justice Ginsburg, I think what happened is, the first court to consider this question was the Third Circuit in the Scott case, pretty soon after the statute was enacted in 1958. And that court, with respect, didn't wrestle with the ordinary meaning of the statutory terms, and it didn't wrestle with the strong premium on simple and administrable jurisdictional rules. And then that doctrine sort of took on a life of its own, I think.",
  "They do.",
  "There -- there is a variety of different approaches. I think all of them share the common feature that they consider, essentially, a totality of the circumstances. And all of them, in our view, share a common flaw, which is - -",
  "Well, the bankruptcy courts -- I think the fairest assessment of the bankruptcy courts as of 1958 was that it was a model. Now, since then, the Collier's treatise, for example, would tell you that the majority and predominant rule is the headquarters rule, even in the bankruptcy context. Pre-1958, I think there was a conflict. That's what the treatises said and that's what we explain in our brief. But there certainly were some courts that adopted a headquarters approach, even in the bankruptcy context. But I think one thing I would caution the Court about is assuming that just because some courts in the bankruptcy context, because of bankruptcy-specific considerations -- and a specific consideration was the felt need to have the assets of the bankrupt estate within the purview of the court so that the court could administer the estate -- that Congress would have wanted to import every judicial application down to every nuanced detail in the bankruptcy context over to the jurisdictional context, where we know that Congress thought that simplicity was a real virtue. And I think, as Your Honor's opinion in Wachovia v. Schmidt a few terms ago points out, there is no reason to assume that Congress would have taken one word in the venue context and applied the exact same meaning to that same word in the jurisdictional context. And here, because of the strong preference -- excuse me -- in favor of simplicity and administrability in jurisdictional rules, that is a particularly poignant reason why the headquarters approach, in our -- in our point of view, should govern in all circumstances. Now - -",
  "Well, I think, if -- if what you are asking, Justice Ginsburg, is, where would the principal place of business be under the bankruptcy statute, the majority rule now, under the Fifth Circuit case Commonwealth Oil Refining and the Seventh Circuit case Peachtree, would show that the majority rule now is that the principal place of business would be New Jersey. And one point I would like to get to in that regard is the sort of oddity of saying that the -- the principal place of business of a company like Hertz would be somewhere other than New Jersey. The Ninth Circuit has a view that the principal place of business of Hertz is California, based on the fact that Hertz conducts 20 percent of its business in California. But it is important to bear in mind that this statute is a zero-sum game. So that if Hertz is deemed to have its principal place of business in California, such that it is disabled from getting access to diversity jurisdiction in California, the consequence is that Hertz would be enabled to gain diversity jurisdiction in every other State -- and I'm putting to one side Delaware, the State of incorporation -- but it would be enabled to gain access to -- to diversity jurisdiction in every other State. So the consequence would be that if Hertz were sued in a State court action in Park Ridge, New Jersey, the site of its headquarters, Hertz could get Federal court jurisdiction in that jurisdiction on the theory that it's an out-of-State company, it's a California company, because it performs 20 percent of its business in California. Now that -- the oddity of that, in our view, is particularly poignant if one takes into account a company like Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart is universally recognized to be an Arkansas corporation because it is headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, but Wal-Mart also, it's undisputed, does substantially more business by any of the measures that the Ninth Circuit considers significant in Texas. It has more employees there; it has more stores there; it generates more revenues there, by a significant factor well in excess of 50 percent over and above any other State. But the consequence of deeming Wal-Mart a Texas corporation based on the amount of business it does in Texas would be not only that Wal-Mart would be disabled from getting Federal court jurisdiction in Texas, but that Wal-Mart would be enabled to get Federal court jurisdiction in Bentonville, Arkansas, on the theory that even in Arkansas, Wal-Mart would be an out-of-State corporation, a Texas corporation, because of the level of business that it conducts in Texas. And we don't think that is the result that Congress would have envisioned in 1958 when it enacted the Principal Place of Business provision. Instead, what Congress presumably had in mind is that corporations, as a general matter, are identified with the location of their headquarters. So in the Wal-Mart situation, Wal-Mart rightly is universally acknowledged to be an Arkansas corporation because of the presence in that State of its headquarters.",
  "There does, Your Honor, and we think -- I guess the -- the comparison I would make is to an individual, because an individual can't declare that he or she is a domiciliary of a particular State and have it be so for citizenship purposes. There has to be something behind that, and so too with corporations.",
  "Exactly, and we -- we share that view. A corporation couldn't simply declare that its headquarters are located in a -- in a location where it has a mailbox, for example, and have that be dispositive for citizenship purposes. What - -",
  "I think certainly it would be a vast improvement over what the Ninth Circuit has. So I would say that as a starting point, Your Honor. I think -- in our view, of course, a principal submission is the headquarters controls in all -- in all situations, and the cost of having, you know, a rebuttable presumption would be: What does it take to rebut it? That would be question. And I think- -",
  "Yes. And I think in that situation, I guess -- I guess there is two different ways that one could look at that. One is to say that you could rebut it, but the other is to say that it is not the headquarters. And I guess that's the way that I would look at it, is to say that if the corporation identifies a location at which it in fact doesn't direct and control the operations of the corporation throughout, it wouldn't constitute the headquarters.",
  "So I guess that's where I would place the load-bearing weight. It may be semantic, but - -",
  "Right. And if -- and - -",
  "There is, Your Honor, and if the other side were able to show that the location that the party identifies as -- as its headquarters does not, in fact, function as a headquarters, in the sense that suppose there is no executives there, or suppose that the officials that are there in fact don't direct and control the company's operations in other locations. Well, then, that -- that would be a real issue. But there are checks against that, because corporations identify their headquarters in other public filings, and in the main, those headquarters are the locations in -- from which the chief executives direct and control the companies' operations - -",
  "Well, they -- they do in the following sense, Your Honor. For example, with the 10-K report for publicly traded companies, I think the question that is asked is not the location of the headquarters but the location of the principal executive offices. And so I think, by definition, in answering that question the principal executives would be located at that -- at that location. Now, if they weren't, we would certainly take Your Honor's point that there could be a back-and-forth about that, but that - -",
  "Well, in -- in response to the latter point, Your Honor, I think the one thing we do know from 1958 is that Congress didn't think that a corporation should be disabled from getting diversity jurisdiction anywhere where it does a substantial business, because it had that proposal before it, and it rejected it.",
  "It instead chose an approach whereby a company is disabled from getting diversity jurisdiction in one, and only one, jurisdiction, the jurisdiction in which it has its principal place of business. And I think what Congress had in mind is that corporations, as a general matter, are identified with their headquarters. And that is why Wal-Mart, for example, is universally recognized as an Arkansas company. It may be that Wal-Mart does substantial business in Texas, substantially in excess of other States, but Wal-Mart also does substantial business in a variety of jurisdictions. But Congress decidedly didn't have the rule that says wherever Wal-Mart does a substantial business and is a well recognized company, it should be disabled from getting to Federal court. It limited it to one jurisdiction. And we think the best reading of the phrase \"principal place of business\" is the situs of the headquarters in that there were -- with -- with respect to the bankruptcy decisions, Your Honor, there -- there were bankruptcy courts that did have a \"headquarters\" approach. And, in fact, the one bankruptcy court of which I am aware that looked at the meaning of the ordinary language -- we cite the -- the relevant -- the portion of the court's opinion at page 50 of our opening brief in footnote 5. It is the First Circuit's opinion in the Burdick case. And what the First Circuit said was that a corporation's, quote, \"principal office,\" rather than a factory, mill or mine, according to ordinary understanding and speech, constitutes the principal place of business within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code.\" And so even before 1958, I think there was definitely a sense out there that the term \"principal place of business\" does mean headquarters. And this gets to Your Honor's other question which is: If Congress really meant \"headquarters,\" why wouldn't they have used the term \"headquarters\" instead of \"principal place of business\"? And I think our answer to that, with respect to Your Honor, is that \"principal place of business\" is an alternative formulation for \"headquarters.\" And so I don't think one can glean too much from the fact that Congress chose \"principal place of business\" rather than \"headquarters\" when \"principal place of business\" in our view is a reference to the headquarters. And this Court's opinion last term in the Oswell Harlow versus United States case is a good example of that, because there the statute that was at issue used the term \"facilitate\" rather than the term \"aid or abet.\" And one could have readily made the argument that because the statute uses the term \"facilitate\" rather than \"aid or abet,\" that normal principles that accompany aiding and abetting liability shouldn't apply in the statute. But the Court rightly in our view reached the contrary conclusion, and it was based on the notion that the term \"facilitate,\" according to Black's Law Dictionary, means the very same thing as \"aid or abet.\" And once you cross that bridge, then you can apply aiding or abetting principles to the term \"facilitate.\" And here, likewise, the term \"principal place of business,\" according to Black's Law Dictionary, means \"headquarters.\" That's how Black's Law Dictionary defines the term. And so the fact that Congress chose one alternate formulation versus another, I don't think speaks too loudly to the question of - -",
  "Sure, and -- and, again, I would look at the public filings. In the public filings in the 10-K, for example, Hertz universally identifies its headquarters as Park Ridge, New Jersey. And the reason is that the chief executive officials are all located in Park Ridge. Now, there is a large administrative apparatus in Oklahoma City, and, according to the affidavit, its administrative activities are performed in Oklahoma City to a lesser extent. And that is at paragraph 11 of the affidavit, which is at pages 29a to 30a of the appendix to the petition. But I don't think there is any real dispute that Hertz's main headquarters are located in Park Ridge rather than Oklahoma City. In point of fact, what you have in Oklahoma City -- and -- and this isn't spelled out in the -- in the affidavit, but what you have in Oklahoma City is essentially the rental call center and plus principal back-office duties like information technology support. But what you have in Park Ridge is all of the company's chief executives. So the decision - making locus for the company's most important decisions is absolutely in Park Ridge, New Jersey, rather than Oklahoma City. And there is no dispute on the point that is before the Court. This Court comes -- this case comes to the Court on the assumption that Hertz's headquarters are located in Park Ridge. The question for the Court is whether that headquarters location should be dispositive for purposes of defining a company's principal place of business. Now, if I could -- if I could turn for one moment to the cost in terms of simplicity and demonstrability of an alternative formulation if the Court were to accommodate a formulation that didn't look to the headquarters, we see three potential categories of costs that are brought about by the -- the proposed approach of Respondents in what the Ninth Circuit has established. The first is the one that underlies the strong preference in favor of simple, demonstrable, jurisdictional rules. And that is just the time and resources that would be invested at the threshold jurisdictional stage in defining whether the case is - - is before the proper court. That in itself is reason enough, in our view - -",
  "That's right. Yes, that's our point, Justice Kennedy, and I think a \"headquarters\" test is simple and straightforward in that respect, and a \"totality of circumstances\" approach isn't. But there is also two additional costs that I would point out about a \"totality of circumstances\" approach. One is that you can have the very real possibility because of the indeterminacy in that approach that different courts would reach divergent conclusions about the citizenship of the very same corporation. And as we point out on page 40 of our brief, that has already happened. Two district courts in the Ninth Circuit alone in two California courts reached divergent conclusions on the citizenship of United Airlines. One court concluded that United was an Illinois citizen, and another court concluded that United was a California citizen. And that is not altogether surprising that you would have those sorts of divergent conclusions given the open-ended nature of the \"totality of circumstances\" approach. The third cost that I would point to is the possibility that because of the indeterminacy in the approach you could have a situation in which a district court finds there is jurisdiction, proceeds to have a trial on the merits and renders -- renders judgment on the merits, and then several years later the court of appeals would reverse the judgment because the district court had gotten the jurisdictional input wrong at the outset. And, again, that also, as with the situation with divergent conclusions on the citizenship of the same corporation, is not just a problem of theory. It has actually happened.",
  "Well, I think -- I guess my point is that precisely because subject-matter jurisdiction can be raised at any point - -",
  "Sure, right. I guess what my point is that you could have a situation where a trial court has reached a resolution on the merits. Several years -- several years later the court of appeals on direct review would reach the conclusion that the district court got it wrong on subject-matter jurisdiction.",
  "And there is a case that we cite in our brief, the Diaz -- Diaz versus Pep Boys case, that involve that situation. If the Court has no further questions, I would like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Your Honor, just one point and I will be brief. The idea that corporations would switch their -- location of their headquarters in order to achieve jurisdictional results hasn't been borne out in any example in which I'm aware. And there is a fundamental reason why. When a corporation decides to relocate its headquarters, it's making a very important business decision about what is the location from which its direction and control is going to emanate. That is not a gamesmanship decision. That's a bona fide decision about where its headquarters are going to be located and where its most important decision -- business decisions are going to be made. If the Court has no further questions - -",
  "It does.",
  "Absolutely, Justice Scalia. If the Court has no further questions.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The dramatic collapse of Enron had profound reverberations experienced throughout the Houston economy and citizenry. Countless individuals in the Houston area were affected, as the court of appeals explicitly recognized, so much so that 60 percent of the jury venire affirmatively acknowledged in the responses to questionnaires that they would be unable to set aside their deep-seated biases or doubted their ability to do so, or that they were angry about Enron's collapse, an anger that was manifested in the vitriolic terms in which Petitioner Jeff Skilling was referred to repeatedly both in the questionnaires and in the community more generally. The passions about this case were so intense and the connections to Enron ran so deep that the entire United States Attorney's Office, all 150 or so attorneys, recused themselves from the investigation that culminated in this prosecution. In those conditions, the court of appeals was correct in unanimously concluding that this was one of the very rare cases in which, because of the degree of passion and prejudice in the community, the process of voir dire cannot be relied upon to adequately ferret out and identify unduly biased jurors. And --",
  "Well, Your Honor, to be clear even one juror who should have been excluded and wasn't would have been enough, but --",
  "Sure.",
  "Yes, Justice Sotomayor. The reason that trial counsel objected to six specific jurors at the juncture that Your Honor's referring to is that that corresponded to six cause objections that had been, in our view, erroneously denied. Now, that in no way suggests that we were satisfied with the remainder of the jury. We had made an objection --",
  "That's right, and that's what I was trying to say, Your Honor, that the reason why trial counsel identified six specific jurors was that there were six other jurors who would have been on the venire as to whom we had applied -- as to whom we had asserted a cause challenge that was denied, and because of that we had to use a preemptory to strike those jurors, which left us without --",
  "Well, no. There were six as -- there were six remaining as to which we didn't have a corresponding for-cause objection that had been denied. But in no way indicates that we were satisfied with the other six. From the very outset, we complained about this process. We said at the outset before trial that no juror could be seated in this case because the process of voir dire couldn't adequately be relied upon in these conditions.",
  "The process was deficient in a couple of respects, Your Honor: First, with respect to time and scope. The voir dire that the trial judge conducted was essentially an ordinary voir dire for ordinary circumstances. He announced before the fact that the voir dire would be conducted in a period of 1 day, and we objected to that. He also announced that he would have limited questioning and that counsel would have very limited opportunity to follow up with additional questions. We also objected clearly and repeatedly to that. And that was manifested in the voir dire that occurred, because what the trial judge did is made two fundamental, we think, mistakes in the way he conducted the voir dire. One occurs with respect to those jurors as to whom they had laid bare their biases, and another occurs with respect to those jurors as to whom they didn't affirmatively acknowledge their biases, but, given the conditions that prevailed in the community, they might well have had biases that they didn't affirmatively acknowledge. Now, with respect to the first, the mistake that, in our view, the trial judge made was to accept a simple assurance of fairness in the face of overt statements of bias and in conditions that confronted this community, where there was deep-seated community prejudice and animus that permeated the Houston -- that permeated the city of Houston, that kind of acceptance of a simple assurance of fairness in the face of repeated overt statements of bias shouldn't be countenanced. And we think what the trial court should have done in that situation is to move to an additional juror. But instead of doing that, the trial court interviewed 46 jurors, nearly 8 more than the minimum that was necessary to constitute a jury in this case. And just to give this a frame of reference, the entire voir dire process in this case took 5 hours, and the trial judge interviewed each juror for approximately 4 and a half minutes. By way of comparison --",
  "He -- he did.",
  "He gave some time, Justice Ginsburg, but he made clear before the voir dire began that that opportunity was going to be limited both in time and scope. With respect to scope -- and this is at page 11805 of the record -- what he said was that follow-up questioning would be permitted if it was reasonable and if it was related to the purposes for which the juror was brought before the bench. And just to paint the picture a little bit, the -- the potential jurors were brought before the bench, and they were left standing, which I think reinforced the conception that this was going to be a rather quick affair and it was not going to allow the kind of extensive, meaningful follow-up that we thought was required. And to give it a frame of reference, in the Oklahoma City bombing case, the prosecution of Timothy McVeigh, that proceeding was transferred from the city of Oklahoma City to Denver, but even after the transfer, the trial judge conducted an 18-day voir dire with an average of 1 hour of interviews per juror; 18 days and 1 hour as compared with 5 hours and 4 and a half minutes. And we think the Oklahoma City experience is much more befitting of the kind of voir dire that’s necessary in circumstances of community prejudice and passion of the kind that existed here.",
  "We did. We --",
  "Sure, it was, Your Honor, and by no means would we in any way diminish the -- the profound human tragedy that accompanied the Oklahoma City case, but I think the reality of the sentiment on the ground in Houston was that Houston citizens, as we pointed out in our brief, in fact referred to the -- to what happened in the wake of the collapse of Enron in terms that were similar to the way they referred to terrorist attacks. They -- they in fact talked about it in terms of the 9/11 attack.",
  "That's true, Justice Ginsburg, but I’d like to clarify one aspect of that, if I could, and that’s that our argument is not -- and it hasn't been at any point in this proceeding -- that pretrial publicity caused the passion and prejudice in the community. This is -- is very much a case in which pretrial publicity was a symptom rather than the cause. Now, pretrial publicity, to be sure, stoked the passions that -- that already lay within the community, but really this was a case in which the passions existed regardless of pretrial publicity. And I think the juror questionnaires and the surveys and all the other evidence that we put before the district court manifests that. If you look at the juror questionnaires -- and they are -- there are several examples of situations in which particular jurors said that they were unaware of any of the pretrial publicity, they did not watch the news, they didn't read the newspapers, they hadn't seen the movies about Enron, but yet they still said they had feelings about Jeff Skilling and Ken Lay. Juror 63, a person who wound up on the panel, is a good example of that. She answered “no” to all the questions concerning her exposure to pretrial publicity, but then when she was asked whether she had views about the guilt or innocence of Jeff Skilling, she said yes, she did; and she elaborated on that by explaining that I think he probably knew he was breaking the law. So this is a person who, notwithstanding a lack of exposure to pretrial publicity --",
  "There -- there was a bit of follow-up to that, Your Honor, but I think the nature of the follow-up is -- is quite illuminating on what we think are some of the fatal flaws in this voir dire process. The follow-up --",
  "Well, our first -- certainly, there should have been a more intensive voir dire, Justice Alito. Now, our first order of submission is that the proceedings should have been transferred, not necessarily because there don't in fact exist or there didn't in fact exist 12 unbiased jurors in the city of Houston. Our point is a different one, and that is that in conditions where you have the level of passion and prejudice that permeated the Houston community, there’s too great a risk that the process of voir dire and particularly the ordinary process of voir dire wouldn't be successful in identifying those 12 people. That's the danger. And the other problem with the argument that the government makes with respect to the fact that there are 4 and a half million citizens in Houston, which I think is part of Your Honor's question, is that that would mean more if the trial judge had gone deeper into the jury pool than the mere 46 jurors he did interview. Because when he interviewed those 46 and stopped at that point, what we were left with was a jury panel as to which there was too great a danger of bias, too great a danger that they would bring their biases to bear with them in adjudicating Petitioner's guilt.",
  "Correct.",
  "Well, I think it has to be read against the context of whether we can be confident that you can find that fair and impartial jury. I think in any -- I think we would say that in any community in which there is 4 and a half million people, there may, in fact, be 12 individuals who aren't so biased that they can't sit. The real danger, though, is that the ordinary process of voir dire, as this Court's decisions repeatedly recognize, in Mu'Min, in Patton, and Murphy and others, the ordinary process of voir dire in that situation can't be trusted to identify those people.",
  "And that’s the danger here.",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "No, that’s --",
  "No, no. No, Mr. Chief Justice. With respect, that's not -- that's not the only danger. I mean, that's -- that's part of it, but I think there's -- there's other ones that we would put forward before that one. There’s two in particular: First, in a community like Houston, in the state of the -- the passion and prejudice that existed in Houston at the time of this trial, there’s a real concern that jurors will not feel fully free to return to that community delivering anything other than the conviction for which the -- the community desires. And that, I think, is an important concern that this Court's decisions identify. And the other one, and this is in Murphy in particular, where there’s a substantial share of the community that's impassioned and prejudiced, as this one was, there’s a concern that even jurors who don't lay bare -- who don't affirmatively acknowledge their biases -- are unwittingly subject to the same biases that permeate the community. And that sort of danger is -- is the reason that in these situations, we think transfer is required. But even if transfer wasn't required, what needed to happen was a more extensive and intensive voir dire than happened here. The voir dire was deficient -- and Justice Ginsburg, this gets back to your question about juror 63. The voir dire was deficient in at least this respect. In conditions like those that permeated Houston, we think it's error to accept the assurance of fairness of a juror who has already laid bare their biases. Now, juror 63, for example, she said she thinks she knew that Jeff Skilling -- she thinks that Jeff Skilling knew he was breaking the law. This is someone as to whom we ought to be very concerned. In our view, that person shouldn't get --",
  "There -- there wasn't a specific challenge for cause against her, Your Honor, but -- but again, we challenged everybody on the basis that voir dire wouldn't adequately ferret out biases in this case. And then we did challenge -- as Justice Sotomayor's question about the six specific challenges that we lodged at the close of the voir dire, but before the jurors were sworn -- juror 63 was one of those jurors. And so I think it was evident that juror 63 was not at all somebody who we were satisfied with. And the reason is, if you look at the nature of -- at the voir dire colloquy with her, the trial court asked her about that statement and asked her: You remember making this statement? Do you still feel that way? And her response was: I don't know. And then she acknowledged: I have no further information to bring to bear on that question than I did then. And at that point, she has only fortified the bias that she brought with her, but the trial court was unsatisfied, and he continued to press. And then he asked her at some point: Can you apply the presumption of innocence? And she said yes. And then that was it. But in our view, a -- a search for a -- -- what I think can fairly be described as a rote assurance of fairness can't be sufficient, given the very evident danger that someone like juror 63, who has already laid bare her biases, would bring her biases with her to the panel when she adjudicated Petitioner's guilt or innocence.",
  "Sure.",
  "Right.",
  "Justice Breyer, it is by nature a contextual inquiry. The standard that this Court has articulated to identify the circumstances in which this sort of extra -- I think -- precaution is necessary is that there has to be, a quote, \"wave of public passion,\" close quote, and that's the language that the Court has used in a number of its decisions. Now, that may --",
  "I'm sorry. Go ahead, Justice Sotomayor.",
  "Yes, and that --",
  "Wave --",
  "Wave of public passion, and I guess the substrata that I would put beneath that, especially for this category of cases, is pervasive animus directed towards the defendant as responsible for a harm felt by the entire community.",
  "I think what the trial court has to do is two things, Your Honor: First, for a should not be allowed on the panel, and an assurance of fairness from that sort of juror isn't enough. At the very least, Your Honor, on this category -- and then I’ll go to my second point -- in a situation in which a juror has laid bare his or her biases, we think that juror shouldn't be seated. But if you’re going to entertain the thought of seating that person, at the very least this has to happen: They have to be forced to confront their assurance of fairness as against the many statements of bias that they may have uttered.",
  "To be clear, Justice Breyer, that ordinary practice would only be altered in the very rare category of cases that involve a wave of public passion. And -- and they would be altered in the following respect: That if somebody had laid bare their biases, the -- in our view, what should happen is that you should move to the next juror. But even if you didn't do that, at least the following should happen, Justice Breyer, and that is that when somebody utters an assurance of fairness, that itself shouldn't be enough when the community is permeated with the sorts of biases that attended this proceeding. The jurors should at least be forced to reconcile their previous statements of bias with their utterance of fairness. The other point I would make is this: That the danger that this Court has identified in conditions like those that pervaded the Houston community is that even with prospective jurors who don't affirmatively acknowledge their biases, there’s a danger that they may have biases they haven't brought to the fore. And we think what can't happen is what the trial judge did in this case, which is to refuse to question any of the jurors on the basis of any response they gave in the questionnaire, other than responses that raised a red flag. And we think if you curtail the inquiry in that regard, it doesn't allow for the sort of voir dire that's necessary to in order to be --",
  "-- in order to ferret out biases that may be latent.",
  "There are, Justice Sotomayor. There’s at R 12036, I think, is an --",
  "I sorry. R 12036 is an important document, which is our renewed motion for change of venue and related relief. And that was after the questionnaire responses had been received. And the point we made in that document is that as a consequence of the questionnaire responses, we already knew that a great deal of bias permeated the venire. And we proposed not only that the proceedings should be transferred, but also that a different sort of voir dire should be conducted than the one that the trial court envisioned. And we laid out in that motion the sorts of things that we thought should be done. And we did that in other places as well, Your Honor, but I think that would be a good place to look. But --",
  "Sure.",
  "Sure.",
  "Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think part of the problem with that sort of rendition is that that -- I think nobody suggests that any dishonest conduct falls within the compass of this law, that no pre-McNally case suggests that. And I think the government doesn’t takes that position, either. If it did --",
  "But I don't think that you’ve advanced the ball, with all due respect, that much by saying there has a right to honest services, because I think what -- at the end of the day, what that would mean is that any situation in which there’s a fiduciary duty or even if there’s not a fiduciary duty, but at least any situation in which there is a fiduciary duty, a nondisclosure of deception would give rise to a Federal felony prosecution. And that has never been the understanding under pre-McNally case law, and that shouldn't be the understanding now, because its sweep is breathtaking, and it's not something that we would ordinarily construe Congress to have intended. Now, I think in -- in this case, there’s several objections we have to the application of the honest services fraud statute to this case. We think the statute is unconstitutionally vague. We think it's particularly vague as applies to -- as applied to anything beyond the narrow category of bribes and kickbacks. But I think in some ways the most straightforward way to understand why the honest services fraud statute can't be applied validly in this case is to appreciate what I think is an evolution in the government's theory. And -- and at the time of Weyhrauch -- and this is at page 48 of the government's brief in Weyhrauch, just a few months ago. The government said that the honest services fraud statute, quote, “Nor does it cover an official whose interest is public knowledge.” So, at that point, I think we -- we would have believed that the honest services fraud statute can't be applied to Jeff Skilling, because his interest, as the government acknowledges, was public knowledge. But the position that the government has taken now is that even though his interest was disclosed, he didn't disclose that he was acting in pursuit of that interest at the expense of the employer's interests, which I read to be contrary to the position that they took in the Weyhrauch case and, I think, which is problematic in two respects. First, there is no pre-McNally understanding, none, that a disclosed interest can give rise to honest services liability. And, second, and maybe more importantly --",
  "A disclosed interest, where the interest is disclosed. All the cases dealt with situations in which the interest is undisclosed, as the government suggested would be the case in the Weyhrauch brief. But -- but perhaps even more importantly, there is no pre-McNally understanding to the effect that acting in pursuit of an interest in compensation can give rise to honest services liability. And, in fact, in a post-McNally case, the Thompson case out of the -- out of the Seventh Circuit, Judge Easterbrook, we think, explained persuasively why pursuit of an interest in personal compensation shouldn't afford the gravamen of --",
  "-- an honest services prosecution.",
  "I think, Justice Ginsburg, the government's theory on how the honest services fraud statute applies in this case is laid out at page 49 and 50. And the interest that the government identifies that was furthered by Petitioner Skilling's action is his interest in compensation. That's -- that's how the government, I think, describes it. And the -- it's true, Your Honor --",
  "Of the government's brief. And it's true, Your Honor, that the deception that they identify has to do with securities fraud. And I'll bracket for the moment that we think that the honest services fraud theory that was put before the jury is not at all commensurate with the one that’s being asserted now. But even if you take as a given that it's the theory now, the elements of honest services fraud under the government's theory are that the individual would act in pursuit of his interest in his own compensation at the expense of the employer's interests in acquiring better information with which to make an informed decision. And one of the fundamental problems we see with that approach is that it would threaten to convert almost any lie in the workplace into an honest services fraud prosecution for the following --",
  "It -- it does, Your Honor, but the interest at issue -- and I'm reading from page 50. This is in the middle of the first full paragraph on page 50. The government says, “That constitute” -- “That conduct constituted fraud.” The only question here is whether the public nature of petitioner's compensation scheme prevents his conduct from constituting honest services fraud.” And then they go on: “Although the” -- “Although petitioner's basic compensation scheme was public, his scheme to artificially inflate the company's stock price by misrepresenting its financial condition, in order to derive additional personal benefits” -- i.e., his compensation -- “at the expense of shareholders, was not” disclosed. So I think the theory of application here is that because he was acting allegedly --",
  "Because the stock is the compensation, Your Honor. There's -- there's no -- I think, in this sort of situation, there’s not a disaggregation between the stock and the compensation. The stock was intimately tied to his compensation, and the personal benefit that, I think, was being received was that compensation interest. I mean, the government can clarify that, but that's my understanding of the government's view.",
  "And the danger with that theory is that it would have the capacity to convert almost any workplace lie into a Federal felony, for the following reason: That, in a variety of situations, an employee might -- might engage in an act of deception to his employer with respect to a work-related matter. For example, suppose that there is an employer policy that says you can only use workplace computers for business purposes, and when asked, the employee says that he is only using it for business purposes, but he is in fact using it for personal reasons. Well, at that point he will have made a deception to the employer. Arguably, it would be material, particularly given that it acts in the face of an employer policy, and it arguably was made in furtherance of the employer's personal interest in maximizing his compensation at the expense of the -- at the expense of the employer's interests in having better information with which to make an informed decision about the employee's future. So for that reason as well, we think that the application of the honest services fraud --",
  "Well, there are two different arguments, Your Honor. Our threshold submission is the statute is unconstitutionally vague, and we believe that it's particularly vague as applied to a category that extends beyond bribes and kickbacks. And I haven't been through those arguments, but they're -- they’re spelled out in our briefs. Now, with respect to the remaining category, which is undisclosed self-dealing, even that category we think is a problem in and of itself. But it's particularly problematic when it's applied to the realm of compensation for the reasons that I have outlined. If the Court has no further questions, I’d like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. A couple of quick points on the honest services fraud issue, and then a couple of points on the juror issue, if I might. With respect to honest services fraud, first of all, I think that the government pointed to the jury instruction -- and, Justice Ginsburg, this goes to some questions that you had raised -- I think what's clear from the capacious nature of the jury instruction that was issued in this case is that the elements that the government say make Jeff Skilling guilty of honest services fraud weren't put before the jury or required to be found by the jury. And for that reason alone, the conviction against Jeff Skilling ought to be overturned. Another point I'd make very quickly with respect to the sweep of the government's theory concerning the workplace is, under our understanding, the duty of loyalty does extend to all employees. It does, and, therefore, the theory that they assert should apply in this case, I think, has devastating implications for workplace relations. Now, with respect to the juror question, a couple of preliminary points, and then I’d like to walk the Court through just one aspect of the voir dire which I think exhibits the manifest flaws in the process the trial court conducted. With respect to the question about the issuance of questionnaires, questionnaires were also issued in the Timothy McVeigh case. But I don't want to limit our comparison to Timothy McVeigh, because I think in response to some of the questions that were raised, I don't want to leave an impression that a multiple-day voir dire with the sort of extensive questioning that we think was required here is not in use in other cases that involve like crimes. In the Martha Stewart case, for example, which was a financial case, there were 6 days of voir dire and after a questionnaire was issued. And in that case, the only reason you needed an extended voir dire was because of the celebrity status of the defendant. You didn't have the deep-seated community passion and prejudice that characterized the Houston venue in this case. So, I think it's not at all unusual to have that kind of extended voir dire, and, in fact, we would say it's absolutely necessary to assure that the defendant receives the fair and impartial jury to which he's entitled.",
  "Well, I think the former rather than the latter --",
  "Well, you don't necessarily need all of that, Your Honor, but I think with respect to the way in which the district court, in fact, conducted this voir dire, if I could just take -- if I could just direct the Court's attention to one juror in particular -- and, Justice Breyer, this is -- maps onto some of the points you were making. This is juror 61, and the relevant exchange is at pages 931a to 932a of the Joint Appendix, which is at -- in -- in volume 2. And I think the way the trial court conducted the voir dire in this case exhibits the manifest flaws in his approach generally. This is someone who at page 932a, it's revealed, answered the question whether she was angry, whether there was anger about Enron, with yes, quote -- it was, quote, “based out of greed, hurt a lot of innocent people.” And to paint the picture more fully, the person was also asked: Do you have an opinion about the collapse of Enron? To which the answer was, quote, “Yes, criminal, caused a huge shock wave which the entire community felt,” close quote. Now, at 931a at the top, she was asked the question whether she had the opinion about Mr. Lay and her answer was, quote, “Shame on him.” And then much of this was put before her in the course of the voir dire. In the middle of page 932a, the first answer -- she's asked the question: “Can you presume as you start this trial that Mr. Lay is innocent?” The answer is, “I hope so, but you know, I don't know. I can't honestly answer that one way or another.”",
  "Not until --",
  "Well, not -- not until this happens first, Justice Breyer, between 932a and 933a. And so she's asked, “So that might -- might your views about Ken Lay cloud your judgment relative to criminal responsibility?”",
  "And her answer is --",
  "I believe that they are. I think that they’re certainly in the record before the court of appeals. So I think that they are.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Long-time lawful permanent resident aliens with two convictions for minor drug possession offenses are subject to removal from the United States, but they are not categorically ineligible to seek discretionary relief from removal from the Attorney General based on their connections and deep family ties to the country. Categorical ineligibility for discretionary relief arises under the Immigration and Nationality Act when a permanent resident has been, quote, \"convicted of an aggravated felony,\" close quote, with the relevant category here permanent residents who have been, quote, \"convicted of a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act,\" close quote. Individuals, such as Petitioner, who have been convicted of drug possession, but as to whom there has been no finding of recidivism, have been convicted of a misdemeanor punishable under the Controlled Substances Act rather than a felony.",
  "That's not correct, Justice Ginsburg, in our view. And the government, it's notable, doesn't make a mootness argument. And I think the reason they don't is that the -- in Lopez, this Court understood that the initial removal doesn't annul the ability of an individual to get cancellation. And so, as Your Honor correctly observes, the question would be whether the reentry has an effect on the cancellation and the eligibility for cancellation. And it does not because Petitioner was removed again by reinstatement of the original removal order. And so, if there’s an argument that the initial removal order wasn't good because cancellation should have been granted, that also carries through to the reinstatement. And as a consequence of that procedural context, there is no mootness argument and I think that's why the government doesn't make -- doesn't take that position. So the question before the Court --",
  "No, it's not that his reentry wasn’t illegal. It's that when he was then again removed, that the -- the way that that was accomplished was by reinstatement of the original removal order.",
  "And so, if the original removal order would have been extinguished by a grant of the cancellation order, then that carries forward to the reinstatement of the original removal -- removal order as well.",
  "Nothing additional happens because of the reentry.",
  "It doesn't make the --",
  "It does, Justice Kennedy --",
  "-- but I think -- I think the way that gets taken into account is it would be one of the discretionary considerations that the Attorney General could take into account in determining whether to grant discretionary relief in the same way that the original conviction for drug possession could be taken into account. Our position --",
  "The removal order would stand, but if cancellation were granted, then he couldn't be removed pursuant to that removal order, because the -- the effect of granting cancellation would be that he’s no longer removable. He gets favorable discretionary relief that enables him to stay in the country. And I think the predicate of Your Honor's question is correct, that we don't contest removability. He was removable because of his drug possession -- drug possession conviction. The question is whether he retains eligibility to seek a favorable exercise of relief from the Attorney General based on affirmative equities in his -- in his favor, such as his deep family ties to the country, the presence of United States citizen children here, his lack of connections to the country to which he would be removed, his employment history, and considerations of that variety. And the question before the Court is whether he and other individuals who are similarly situated should have an opportunity to make that case to the Attorney General. He is removable. The question is whether the Attorney General is in a -- is in a position to grant him a favorable exercise of discretion. And we think the Attorney General is, because in order to be categorically ineligible for discretionary relief from removal, a permanent resident alien has to have been convicted of a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. And when you’ve been convicted of drug possession and there has been no finding of recidivism, you have been convicted of a misdemeanor punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.",
  "What elements?",
  "Justice Sotomayor, at the very least what would have had to have happened is that he would have had to have been found to be a recidivist under a State provision that attaches sentencing consequences to being found to have been a recidivist. And so, what you need is an analogous State offense to the Federal offense of recidivist possession.",
  "Well, analogous enough to count, in the sense that what you need under the Federal law is a finding of recidivism at least. That's our principal submission.",
  "It's a determination by the court that --",
  "By the State convicting court. In the case of a State conviction, it would be a determination by the State convicting court that the person in fact has a prior conviction. And then as a consequence under the State scheme, a sentencing consequence would attach.",
  "Yes, in -- in the context of a State conviction. It --",
  "It doesn't have to be a State felony, no.",
  "That's correct. And that's the work done by the words \"punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.\"",
  "Right.",
  "But -- but, Justice Scalia, he has to have been convicted of the felony. That’s the critical distinction. He may have committed a felony --",
  "He has to have been convicted of a crime --",
  "He was --",
  "He was not punishable as a felon in Federal court for two reasons: First, he was convicted of drug possession. A person in Federal court who is convicted of drug possession is a misdemeanant, not a felon, unless and until there’s a finding that he's a recidivist. You have to have the finding of recidivist in order for a felony sentence even to conceivably attach to an individual, and you just don't have that in the context of this case, where all you have is a conviction of drug possession alone. A felony sentence doesn't even come into the picture unless there’s a finding of recidivism.",
  "That didn't happen in the State court.",
  "For present purposes, that's correct. And Justice Alito, I think it's important to understand -- and this goes to the second response to your question, Justice Scalia -- that the statute, the Immigration and Nationality Act, defines \"conviction\" in a particular way. It defines \"conviction\" as \"a formal judgment of guilt … entered by a court.\" As Your Honor's opinion for the Court in Deal v. United States understood, statutes could define convictions in one of two ways: It could define a conviction as a finding of guilty, or it could define a conviction as the formal judgment based on that finding.",
  "Here we have the latter.",
  "Under --",
  "Under that statute -- different statutes conceive of it different ways, but the applicable definition of \"conviction\" here, because we’re talking about an immigration consequence, is the definition of \"conviction\" under the Immigration and Nationality Act. And that definition is set forth at page 2a of the appendix to our brief, the blue brief, the opening brief. And it's 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(48)(A), and it says that: \"The term 'conviction' means, with respect to an alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court.\" And so, here you have \"a formal judgment of guilt\" as the operative definition of a conviction, and that formal judgment of guilt includes both the adjudication of guilt and the sentence. And so the important point to bear in mind is that at the time that the conviction, as defined by the Immigration and Nationality Act, is entered, we know whether the person has been found to have been a recidivist. At that point, the adjudication of guilt has happened, the sentence has been imposed, and we know whether a finding of recidivism has been made. In the absence of such a finding, the maximum sentence they could attach under Federal law, Justice Scalia, is a misdemeanor sentence of 1 year of imprisonment. A felony sentence is not on the table, and if the maximum sentence to which a person is subject is a misdemeanor sentence, the person has been -- has been convicted of a misdemeanor; they haven't been convicted of a felony. And that --",
  "Oh, sure. But -- but I think -- I think that confuses two things. In that situation, the second proceeding is in Federal court --",
  "-- and in that Federal court proceeding, you can take account of the prior State court conviction, but in that second proceeding, the fact that he was convicted previously in State court would have to have been found by the Federal court. That's the relevant finding of recidivism, and in the absence of that finding of recidivism, the Federal defendant wouldn't be subject to a felony sentence. He would only be subject to a misdemeanor sentence.",
  "He has to be convicted of a felony, Justice Scalia, and in the absence of a finding of recidivism, he can't have been convicted of the felony. He may be punishable as a felon in the abstract ex ante. So I don't take issue with the proposition that a person commits recidivist possession when they commit possession and they have a prior conviction. In that abstract sense, the person has committed recidivist possession, and if they were charged and found to have been a recidivist, they would be convicted of recidivist possession. But in the absence of that finding, they haven't been convicted of recidivist possession, and --",
  "It doesn't have to be by a jury, and I think it would depend on the State, Mr. Chief Justice. It doesn't necessarily have to be by a jury, because I think several States have the recidivism component of the offense as a finding that could be made by the court, but the --",
  "And you've held --",
  "-- that's okay as a constitutional matter. But --",
  "There are --",
  "It is in those five States, Justice Kennedy, but I don't think that should give the Court a great deal of pause, for the following two reasons.",
  "What would happen is this: The person would not be categorically ineligible for discretionary relief.",
  "They wouldn't have been convicted of recidivist possession. But it's important to note, Justice Kennedy, that doesn't mean that those prior convictions don't enter into the picture at all. They do, because, in the exercise of discretion by the Attorney General, the Attorney General can take into account any prior convictions, including those that don't render somebody categorically ineligible. All we’re talking about here is whether the person has a chance to make a discretionary case. They do have that chance in Your Honor's hypothetical, but those convictions would be taken into account. Now, I want to point out, though, that there’s another reason that I think the fact that in that hypothetical it wouldn't render the defendant categorically ineligible for discretionary relief shouldn't give the Court a great deal of pause. And that's because the relevant category of aggravated felony that we're talking about here is illicit category that's outlined by the statute. Now, with respect to that category, every State has trafficking laws. Every State punishes drug trafficking. So every State's offenses do count for purposes of this category of aggravated felony. When we’re -- that's the iceberg. The tip of the iceberg is recidivist possession, which is a subset of illicit trafficking in a controlled substance. Now, with respect to that tip, Federal convictions for recidivist possession still do count, so we have those. With respect to the State --",
  "Well, sure, but if a State -- two responses, Mr. Chief Justice: If a State prosecutor does prosecute under an available recidivist possession offense, then that would count because the State prosecutor would have brought the charge, the finding by hypothesis would have been made. That would be felony recidivist possession under Federal law, and there would be categorical ineligibility. Now, I think what may be -- what may be sort of lurking beneath Your Honor's question is the recognition that the Federal consequences of a State conviction are going to turn on State prosecutorial decisions. That's true. But that's a fixed feature of any scheme in which Federal immigration consequences turns on what happens in State court, and this Court's decision in Lopez recognizes that. For example, States -- several States don't have a Federal offense of possession with intent to distribute drugs. That's a Federal offense. What States, some States, have instead is possession with a degree of penalty attached to the amount of drugs possessed. They don't have the separate offense of possession with intent to distribute. Now, the fact that certain States don't have that offense doesn't mean that an individual who is convicted of state possession with no finding of an intent to distribute would be categorically ineligible for discretionary relief from removal, because what Congress understood was that some States will have qualifying offenses and some States won't. In those States that do, where the State has the offense and where the State prosecutor makes the decision to charge under that offense will -- at that point the State conviction will count as a Federal felony. It will be a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act, and the person at that point would be categorically ineligible for discretionary relief.",
  "Right.",
  "I don't think it would be, Justice Breyer, because --",
  "Sure.",
  "Lopez?",
  "Is it Lopez? Is that --",
  "Correct.",
  "Well, I --",
  "Well -- well, with respect, Justice Breyer, I don't think that's the inquiry that's called for even by this sentence. I think what this sentence called for is an inquiry into what the State offense captures in its offense elements to make up a conviction.",
  "Because I think that's the -- the necessary inquiry that’s --",
  "It's -- it's necessarily what's at issue. It --",
  "This sentence doesn't necessarily -- it asks whether --",
  "It asks whether it proscribes conduct.",
  "It asks whether -- the sentence asks whether the State offense proscribes conduct.",
  "And I read \"proscribes conduct\" to mean there would be offense elements of proscribed conduct.",
  "Justice Breyer --",
  "No --",
  "Yes, I don't want to take issue -- I don't want to argue against myself, certainly, but I would just make the following point: That if I’m understanding what Your Honor is saying correctly, and I'm not sure that I am, but if I’m understanding what you're saying correctly, I would just point out to the Court that the Court dealt with that sort of situation in the four corners of Lopez itself when it talked about -- talks about what happens with possession with intent to distribute. Some States don't have possession with intent to distribute as an offense; they only have possession. Now, I -- as I understand what Your Honor is suggesting, you could look at all the -- the ken of individuals who have been convicted of State possession and you could ask as a matter of fact, do they in fact possess with intent to distribute? And then you could reach some consequence on that basis.",
  "Okay.",
  "I -- I have to confess, I'm not exactly sure what Your Honor is asking. So --",
  "I think --",
  "Right.",
  "It wouldn't constitute the analogy to the Federal offense of recidivist possession, Justice -- Justice Alito, because that could also happen in the Federal system. In the Federal system, you could have an individual who is convicted of possession, and then the fact that they had a prior conviction could have some role in the -- for example, in the presentencing report.",
  "You don't have --",
  "Two things are missing, Justice Alito: First, you don't have a formal judgment of guilt entered by the court, which is what a conviction requires. And the consequence of not having a formal judgment of guilt is that the statutory maximum penalty isn't raised. And I think what’s relevant here is that when you have a finding of -- a formal judgment of guilt of recidivism in the Federal system, which happens when the prosecutor brings a charge and the court makes the finding at sentencing, the maximum sentence that could be imposed against the defendant is raised from a misdemeanor sentence to a felony sentence. But that doesn't happen in a situation in which the fact of a prior conviction is taken into account, for example, under a presentencing report. It doesn't raise the statutory maximum, and there’s no formal judgment entered based on that determination by the court. And so that's the distinction. And I think the relevant way to look at it is you take account of what would happen in the Federal system and you ask: Would it have the consequence in the Federal system of rendering somebody guilty of the felony of recidivist possession as opposed to the misdemeanor of simple possession? And it wouldn't in the Federal system, and by parity of reasoning it also would not have that consequence in the State system.",
  "Well --",
  "Well, I think there is, Justice Alito, and let me just say as a preliminary matter it's not based on the vagaries of State law, because it's -- I'm applying the same analysis to State convictions as I do to -- to Federal convictions. But one way to look at it is to ask, suppose that a State or even Federal law made it salient for sentencing purposes whether somebody intended to distribute when they possessed. They were convicted of drug possession. There is an offense of possession with intent to distribute, but they’re not charged with that offense; they’re charged with drug possession. And then sentencing somehow makes it salient, not for purposes of raising the statutory maximum, but just for purposes of sentencing within the range whether the person intended to distribute. I don't think anybody would say that the individual was convicted of the felony of possession with intent to distribute because the -- the judge in sentencing took into account an intent to distribute in some way under a sentencing scheme.",
  "It has to be a sentencing factor that raises the statutory maximum. And the reason that matters is that under this statute, the person has to have been convicted of a felony, and the only way they’re convicted of a felony is the offense of which they are convicted can lead to a felony sentence. And the sentencing factor in this case of recidivism is necessary in order to give rise to a Federal sentence. In the absence of that finding, the person has been convicted of a misdemeanor, because the maximum sentence they can receive is a misdemeanor sentence of 1 year of imprisonment. If the Court has no further questions, I’d like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.",
  "Yes, I think that they’re potentially distinguishable. But, you know, this is -- this is not a question that has ever come up in the immigration context. It would be a special rule that would be based on the Court's decision, we think, in Custis and not anything about “punishable” referring to section 851 procedures.",
  "Thank you --",
  "Right, and because it's essential to the Federal statute, it's necessarily a part of our argument. I don't think our argument would be any different if the Federal statute read differently, but you can only be punishable as a felon under Federal law if you had a prior drug conviction, and if you had a prior drug conviction that was in fact found to exist. And I think, Justice Kennedy, the first point I’d like to make in rebuttal -- there's two points I’d like to make. The first addresses a question you raised concerning what happens in a situation in which the second proceeding is a Federal proceeding rather than a State proceeding. And I think this is important to highlight is a Federal proceeding, we have a person who has a prior conviction for drug possession. We have a person who is then prosecuted in Federal court for a second time for drug possession. The prosecutor by hypothesis never brings the initial conviction into play. The court therefore never finds that the person is a recidivist. As a consequence, that person cannot as a matter of law receive a felony sentence. They can only be sentenced as a misdemeanant. But nonetheless, the government would say that they have been, quote, \"convicted of a felony, punishable under the Controlled Substances Act,\" close quote --",
  "-- even though no felony sentence could be imposed.",
  "There were -- there were two things that made it a Federal felony, Justice Scalia. First was it had to be an offense that involved fraud.",
  "And then -- and that had to be found by the convicting court.",
  "There was no issue about that. Our --",
  "Our point is that --",
  "That’s the --",
  "But -- but there's a very important textual distinction, Justice Scalia, because under the provision at issue in Nijhawan, the offense had to involve fraud, and then there was a separator in which the loss exceeds $10,000. And the Court focused on the fact that the text read \"in which.\" That was critical, and another thing that was critical in Nijhawan was that if you looked at Federal statutes and asked, were there any that as to which the elements would require a loss in excess of $10,000, there were none. And because of that practical consequence, the Court reached the conclusion that Congress would immigration judge could have found. We have the opposite situation here.",
  "You had -- sure.",
  "Because, again, the test -- the text also had \"in which,\" which the Court found critical -- that text is lacking here -- and because the statute would have had no practical consequence, absent the Court's interpretation.",
  "That's not true here.",
  "Because for both reasons that the Court found that you could look to the circumstances in Nijhawan, neither of those two reasons applies here. You don't have a textual separator. You don't have the words \"in which.\" All you have is the word \"convicted.\" And you also don't have the consequence that the -- the provision would cease to have any practical implications under our reading. It would absolutely have practical implications under our reading, because anytime a person was found to have been a recidivist and their sentence was raised, their maximum sentence was raised as a consequence, they will have been deemed to have been aggravated felon. But here, that didn't happen. You'd have to understand that in the Federal system, even though an individual could not as a matter of law be sentenced as a felon, they nonetheless would have been deemed to have been convicted of a felony, and at the very least -- and this is the second point I'd like to make, if I could just --",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Principles of lenity which the government agrees are potentially applicable here would dictate ruling in our favor even if you thought that the text was ambiguous. The principles of lenity do apply. An individual who pleads guilty to possession in exchange for a prosecutor's decision to refrain from charging him as a recidivist and, therefore, could only be sentenced as a misdemeanor I think should be allowed to be convinced that he has been convicted of a misdemeanor rather than a felony.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When an officer follows the favored practice under the Fourth Amendment of obtaining a warrant from a neutral magistrate before conducting a search, the officer in all but the most narrow circumstances can rely on the magistrate's independent determination of probable cause, without fear --",
  "Well, I think one of the questions that would arise is whether the one as to which you thought there was a problem would expand the scope in a meaningful way, because if -- let's take Your Honor's hypothesis that there's less of a reason to be concerned about the firearms-related aspects of the warrant than the gang-related parts of the warrant; then the question would arise whether you would have a Fourth Amendment violation in the first place, because if the gang-related parts of the warrant didn't expand the scope of the search in such a way that would implicate independent privacy interests, there wouldn't be a Fourth Amendment problem with that aspect of the warrant. And, therefore, there -- you wouldn't have a qualified immunity issue for sure.",
  "That's right. You look -- you look at the two aspects of the warrant, and you ask whether the second one, which is hypothesized to be the problematic one, would allow you to search in places or search with more intensity than the first --",
  "Well, but -- no. I think the relevant language is at page 52 of the Joint Appendix. That's what sets forth the two paragraphs at issue. And the first paragraph, which Justice Kagan supposes doesn't raise a problem -- and I'll engage that assumption -- it provides not only for searches of all firearms, but it provides, and we think legitimately, for searches of any receipts or paperwork showing the purchase, ownership, or possession of the handguns being sought. And so, if -- and paperwork certainly includes photographs, because if you find photographs of an individual carrying a particular firearm, that's good evidence. And so, photographic evidence is within the scope of the first paragraph, not just the second. And so, it does raise the question of whether the second paragraph increases the scope. The other point I'd raise in this respect is that, in the second paragraph itself, the anchor sentence in some respects in the second paragraph is the second sentence, which discusses not gang-related indicia in particular but articles of personal property tending to establish the identity of persons in control of the premise or premises, writ large. And note -- and that provision has not been seen to have a -- have a problem associated with it thus far. The district court thought it was okay. The court of appeals, at page 27a of the petition appendix, seemed to assume it was okay. And that's understandable because there are a legion of cases that support those sorts of provisions --",
  "-- including the Ewing case cited by the majority below.",
  "Yes, I believe so.",
  "Well, I -- I think the Court has attempted to do that in Malley and Leon itself, because it has made clear that in the main, in all but the most narrow circumstances, where a magistrate does find the existence of probable cause, the court need not engage in any searching inquiry to determine that qualified immunity is appropriate --",
  "Well --",
  "Well, I think in some sense, Justice Scalia, you have two -- in response to the two parts of your question. First of all, in defining what is objectively unreasonable in this situation, the Court has used some pretty strong language. In Malley, it spoke in terms of a magistrate who's grossly incompetent. And in Leon, it spoke of --",
  "No, it was speaking of a magistrate actually, and not the officers. Because the point is that in order to find that officers are liable in this situation, the officers would have to be so sure that probable cause is lacking that only a grossly incompetent magistrate could sign off on the probable cause assessment. So, it used gross incompetence with respect to the magistrate, which illustrates the degree to which the standard is heightened in this context. And in terms of whether good faith principles come into play in the qualified immunity context, what the Court said in Malley is that the same standard for objective -- of reasonableness that governs in the good faith context for suppression purposes also governs in the qualified immunity context under 1983. And so, I think there is room to import into the qualified immunity context these principles of good faith, like, for example, Mr. Chief Justice, the question of whether the officers in question asked superiors for their assessment of whether there's probable cause. And in Sheppard, which was a suppression case, but in Sheppard, at page 9 -- 8 and 9 of the opinion, the Court specifically made reference to the fact that the officer in that case had asked for a probable cause assessment --",
  "Well, that -- I mean, certainly I don't want to urge any -- anything upon the Court that would tend to water down the standard in the suppression context, but the only point I'd add to this, Justice Scalia, is that when you're looking at it from the perspective of a reasonable officer who's trying to assess whether he should go forward and ask for assessment of probable cause from the magistrate, one consideration that seems natural to take into account is what actions the officer has taken, not just the quantum of proof that the officer has put in the affidavit but what actions has he taken. Has he asked for a -- has he asked his supervisor --",
  "The test as outlined by the Court in Malley is whether it's objectively reasonable for the officer to rely on the magistrate's assessment of probable cause.",
  "It -- the Court did say that, Your Honor, and the Court put the formulation in a number of respects in Malley itself. It said, \"We hold that the\" -- this is at page 344: \"We hold that the same standard of objective reasonableness that we applied in the context of a suppression hearing in Leon defines the qualified immunity accorded an officer whose request for a warrant allegedly caused an unconstitutional arrest.\" And I think that's where the Court then goes on and articulates what Your Honor just quoted. But then the Court later says: \"In Leon\" -- and this is at page -- this is at page 345: \"In Leon, we stated that 'our objective faith' -- 'good faith inquiry is confined to the objectively ascertainable question of whether a reasonably well-trained officer would have known that the search was illegal despite the magistrate's authorization.' The analogous question in this case,\" and it goes on to speak about the analogous question.",
  "We think if the current test is applied properly, it's sufficiently protective. And really the question is how it's applied. And in this case it was applied in -- in a way that I think is not sufficiently protective of police officers.",
  "You could --",
  "Applied -- well, I meant to say applied correctly.",
  "If applied correctly -- I apologize if I misspoke. If applied correctly, it should sufficiently protect --",
  "No -- not necessarily as a general rule, Justice Kennedy. It has to be context-specific. And here you had a lot more than that. You had an individual who had perpetrated an attempted murder, who was a known member of a violent gang, who had -- who had perpetrated physical assaults against this victim before, and who had directly threatened the victim that he would murder her if she ever went to the police and that he was going to kill her.",
  "Well, that's the test that --",
  "Yes, this is a very important point, Justice Kennedy. At page 48 of the joint appendix, the language of the relevant California statute is set forth. The California provision is section 1524(a)(3) of the California Penal Code, and it authorizes a search for and seizure of items where they're possessed by a person with the intent to use them as a means of committing a public offense. And that's the provision that was invoked this very warrant. And these -- and that --",
  "Just the one sentence. That provision is by no means an outlier. It's in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(c)(3), and it's in the Model Penal Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure at section 210.3, subsection (1)(c). Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The fundamental flaw with Texas's approach is that it directly inverts the burden established by section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Section 5 places the burden on a covered jurisdiction to show that a proposed voting change is nondiscriminatory in purpose and effect, and the change can't go into effect unless and until the State carries its burden in that regard.",
  "Well, with Judge -- with what Judge Smith did, I guess in that context, Justice Kennedy, there wouldn't be a section 5 issue at all.",
  "And all you'd be dealing with is section 2 or the Equal Protection Clause.",
  "Well, I - -",
  "Yes. Well, I guess what I would say is this, that in the malapportionment context what this Court typically has said the district court should do is to start with a plan that's already in effect and then modify it according to neutral districting principles to remove the malapportionment issue. And that's - -",
  "Well, I guess I would disagree with you, Justice Alito. I want to make two preliminary observations on what a district court is supposed to do in this regard, and then I'll try to walk through the principles that should guide this inquiry. The first preliminary observation is what a district court is not supposed to do, and what a district court is not supposed to do is to take the un-precleared plan as a given, because section 5 forecloses it. Now, what's a district court supposed to do? It's not at sea, contrary to the underpinning of some of the arguments made today, because the district court starts with the last legally enforceable plan, which after all is the last manifestation of State policies and priorities. So, you have that as a starting point. And then it has to modify that plan, of course, to deal with malapportionment issues and to comply with section 2 and section 5 - -",
  "There is discretion in the inquiry, Justice Alito. I'm not going to -- I'm not going to disagree with that. What it looks to is the districting criteria that had been applied by this jurisdiction in the past. And, for example, in this case - -",
  "Well, I guess - -",
  "No, I don't think you could do that.",
  "Well, I don't -- not in the context of section 5, Your Honor. It's -- that's one option, but the other option would be to use a malapportioned plan, which this Court has suggested would be something the courts could do. Now, that's not a preferred option, to be sure. But we're not in that situation here, because what you have is interim maps that have been developed. We're not in the kind of emergency situation that you're positing.",
  "Only if there's no time for a district court to adopt a different plan. But - -",
  "There is an emergency exception, as there is with all sorts of legal rules. But that's so far as we would go. Now, I would like to address the proposition that what the Court would be doing here under Texas's view is just a standard application of substantial likelihood of success principles, because it's not. It's decidedly different from standard operation of substantial likelihood of success principles in three fundamental respects. The first goes to the burden, Justice Kennedy, and I think you alluded to this in your question. The burden in a preliminary injunction context stays with the same party at the preliminary injunction stage as at the merits stage. And so, when in a preliminary injunction context the court is asking has there been a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, the same party has to make that showing as has to make that showing at the merits stage. Here Texas would turn that upside down, because at the merits stage, which is the preclearance proceeding - -",
  "That would certainly be better. I think that would improve things quite a bit. But that's not what Texas -- the approach that Texas proposes today. But it's different in two other respects from a standard preliminary injunction context as well. And one is what Justice Ginsburg alluded to, which is here you don't have a situation in which the same court that's going to forecast its ultimate adjudication of the merits is also deciding what it's going to do at the preliminary injunction stage.",
  "That's right.",
  "Well - -",
  "No, I don't -- I don't know about that, because I think what a district court is supposed to do when preclearance is pending is not accept all the challenges. What it's supposed to do is to apply traditional districting criteria to the benchmark. So, I guess - -",
  "Well, there is some language in the opinions to -- to that effect, Justice Kennedy. I have to say the district court opinions here are not a model of clarity. In some respects, they seem to outline the right inquiry. If you look at Joint Appendix 137 to 138, I think what the district court said it was doing was starting with the status quo, which is the benchmark, and then modifying it.",
  "That's right.",
  "Well, that's -- that's right, Mr. Chief Justice, and I think we point to that in our brief as an area in which the district court could give further explanation on remand.",
  "Well, I think section 5 can't help but drive - -",
  "Well, of course, Your Honor, Texas is in a different position precisely because it's a covered jurisdiction. And when you have a section 5 case, section 5 can't help but take precedence in some respects, precisely because a proposed change can't go into effect unless and until the covered jurisdiction shows that it's nondiscriminatory in purpose and effect. But I do think it's important - -",
  "That -- that may be, Your Honor, but I think then if -- if it can't address the section 5 issue at all, then the one thing that shouldn't happen is that the section 2 court gives effect to the un-precleared plan, because that's something that the D.C. district court is supposed to do.",
  "Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I appreciate that. I guess what I would say, Justice Kennedy, is, if you use the un-precleared plan as the starting point, which is what Texas proposes, you are giving effect to that, notwithstanding the preclearance requirement of section 5. And with a covered jurisdiction, that's something that section 5 doesn't allow. Now, I do think it's important to consider Texas's preclearance submission in the context of the other statewide preclearance submissions that have been submitted in this election cycle. If you look at the Government's brief at pages 1a to 3a, I think what that bears out is that there's not a fundamental problem with section 5 or the way section 5 operates. The problem, insofar as it -- as it exists, is with respect to the particular submissions that Texas has made, because there were 20 submissions of statewide plans for administrative preclearance. In all 20 cases, the Attorney General precleared them. In 19 of the 20 cases, the Attorney General precleared it within the initial 60-day window. Now - -",
  "Well, I don't know that it is, Your Honor, and I have two -- two responses in that respect. First -- and this goes to a question that Justice Alito asked earlier. What is this Court supposed to do in this situation? And I think one thing that could absolutely happen is if there were a remand, the D.C. district court could complete its preclearance proceeding, which would be very illuminating for the what the Texas district court is supposed to do.",
  "What I would say is this: The D.C. district court has scheduled trial to begin on January 17th. It's supposed to last 8 days. Closing argument is on February 3rd. If you look at what happened at the summary judgment stage, Justice Breyer, they had summary judgment arguments on one day; 6 days later, they - -",
  "No, not that.",
  "Well, of course, if preclearance is granted, we -- we won't have an issue with drawing maps.",
  "And we - -",
  "Yes. Sure. I think it's if -- insofar as the coalition districts and ability-to districts emerge from natural growth, there's nothing suspect about them. The one example I point to is district 33. If you look at Joint Appendix, pages 146 to 147, it's not clear what the -- what the district court was doing in that regard.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start off addressing the Secret Service in particular because that's the principal focus, although I take the point that there are questions about applying the rule in a broader context. But I think understanding why the rule makes sense in the context of Secret Service agents and law enforcement officers who are performing similar protective functions would help inform why it makes sense to broaden the rule as well. What the Secret Service -- I'll pick up on the point that Petitioners' counsel was making, which is that it's legitimate in this context for Secret Service agents to take into account expressive activity in determining whether the circumstances warrant a discretionary exercise of the power to arrest.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's correct. And that's why I wouldn't limit it to the Secret Service in particular. I think what happens in a lot of these contexts is that it's natural for these individuals to encounter First Amendment activity by the public, and it's legitimate for them to react to First Amendment activity in deciding whether the circumstances warrant an arrest. And the problem arises because it's very difficult to distinguish between, on one hand, a legitimate consideration of expressive activity as evidencing the sort of threat that warrants a response from an illegitimate consideration of expressive activity borne of a motive to suppress a viewpoint.",
  "I think it would, Justice Kennedy, because we would have an across-the-board, no-probable-cause requirement of the kind that the Court applied in the retaliatory prosecution context in Hartman. Now, I think your -- the question of the degree of animus asserted by the agent on the scene is exactly why these are complicated factual questions. Those kinds of allegations can be made, and then you're going to have a trial where the agent is on the stand, and the jury is going to have a very difficult time, and the agent is going to have a difficult time explaining why it is that he acted legitimately based on expressive activity because he felt that there was a threat to the person he was trying to protect, as opposed to explaining that he didn't act in order to suppress the viewpoint that was being asserted. These kinds of allegations can often be made. And, in fact, they can even be manufactured at the scene by an intelligent person who's going to be the subject of an arrest. And I think that complicated question of causation is exactly why it makes sense to apply in this context the same objective screening in the form of a no-probable-cause requirement in Hartman to this context of retaliatory arrest.",
  "Yes.",
  "That's correct, Justice Scalia, and that was going to be my next point. Once we understand why it is that it makes sense to apply this rule in the context of officers who engage in this sort of critical public protective functions of the Secret Service, I think we understand why it also makes sense to apply it in other situations, because law enforcement can legitimately take into account expressive activity when they're engaged in functions such as crowd control. And in those contexts as well, it's going to be difficult to disaggregate the legitimate consideration of expressive activity as evidencing a threat --",
  "-- from an illegitimate desire to suppress a viewpoint. Sorry.",
  "I'm making a --",
  "I think --",
  "I -- I would not draw a distinction, Justice Breyer. Of course, there's going to be factual situations --",
  "Yes.",
  "Well, I think --",
  "Right, and I can understand the basis for the nervousness. I guess the question for the Court is whether the benefits of having an administrable across-the-board rule outweigh the costs of trying to forge some sort exceptions to deal with extreme hypotheticals. And --",
  "We do. We've done --",
  "We've done an unscientific search, but to use the same time frame of reference that the Court used in Hartman, which is looking back 25 years, if you do a sort of standard Westlaw search, what you'll see is there's roughly a hundred court of appeals cases and 450 or so district court cases where --",
  "I don't know.",
  "It's -- the -- I'm sure there are scores and scores of arrests. That's correct. And, of course, all we're talking about is the cases that get to the point where you have an opinion that can be -- that can be found. And there's the obvious point that, depending on what the Court does here, you may see a proliferation of -- of those claims. And we certainly hope that wouldn't be the case. But I think on -- in -- on the question of whether it makes sense to have an across-the-board rule, I guess I would echo what Petitioners' counsel was suggesting, which is you can have the same set of considerations in the retaliatory prosecution context because prosecutors do act with -- by hypothesis, with illicit motives in some situations. And the Court considered whether the benefits of having an across-the-board rule outweigh the costs of forging an exception to deal with extreme circumstances. And what the Court said was: We want to have a rule that's designed to deal with the mine run of cases; we don't want to have a rule that has an exceptional-circumstances exception because in that -- at that point, there will be a great deal of litigation concerning what cases fit within of the exception and what cases don't. And what the Court said was that's rather like designing a retirement plan to deal with the possibility that someone might win the lottery. That's in footnote 10 of Hartman. And I think similar considerations would weigh -- counsel in favor of applying an across-the-board objective, no-probable-cause screen in this context as well. And I think it's important to understand that --",
  "Well, I -- with respect, Justice Ginsburg, I think this case is of a piece with Hartman in two relevant respects. Your Honor is quite correct that Justice Souter's opinion focused on the fact that you have two individuals in play. You can have that situation here, but we don't base it on that. What the opinion was getting to was that that creates complex issues of causation in the prosecution context. And I think it was the complex causation that really drove the need to have an objective across-the-board rule. You have the same kind of complex causation problem here, for the reasons that I've explained, which is that it's extremely difficult to disentangle a legitimate desire to act -- to suppress danger, of which speech is evidence, from an illegitimate desire to suppress a viewpoint.",
  "The same immunity?",
  "No. The -- they -- I think the Court's decision in Whren, for example, supposes that even though you have probable cause, you can have an equal protection claim if the proof could be made -- and this is very important. In the equal protection context, including for race, there is a different objective screen in place, and it's a stringent objective screen that this Court announced in Armstrong, which is that --",
  "Well, I think part -- part of the reason is this, that in -- with the First Amendment, expressive activity can legitimately be taken into account precisely because it can manifest a danger, whereas with race in the ordinary case, I think the reason why we have these principles in the race context is it's ordinarily not a relevant consideration. And the Armstrong rule is designed to distinguish between circumstances in -- in which race was the motivation and in which race wasn't the motivation. And it serves that purpose well. But it doesn't work so well in this context, because here First Amendment activity can legitimately be taken into account; when, as in this case, a Secret Service agent overhears an individual say that he's going to ask the Vice President how many babies he's killed, it makes all the sense in the world for the Secret Service to focus their attention on that person.",
  "Well, I think it's -- the nature, intensity, and vehemence with which the First Amendment activity is being engaged in can inform an officer on whether the circumstances present the kind of danger that warrants a law enforcement response. So, I -- and when a law enforcement officer does that, he's going to be subject to potential liability if an individual says: Look, you weren't reacting against me because of the way I was expressing my views; you were acting -- reacting against me because you disagree with my views and you wanted to suppress them. And that's a very hard thing to disentangle. And it not only has that problem at the back end, but it results in a problem at the front end as well, because what happens at the front end is that officers at the very outer margins might have in the back of their mind a concern that if they acted based on their best intuitions about what kind of law enforcement response is warranted, they might later be subject to suit based on a mistaken assumption and potentially an ability to convince a jury that they were acting based on an illegitimate desire to suppress a viewpoint rather than on a legitimate desire --",
  "I -- I don't know --",
  "It's potentially there, but I just -- I don't have the answer at my disposal, Justice Breyer.",
  "Well, these -- certainly, we know that these kinds of interactions arise with some frequency. I think there was some publicity surrounding the --",
  "In --",
  "In this --",
  "No, I -- candidly, I didn't -- we didn't conduct a search with that object in mind. So, I can't give you an answer one way -- one way or the other. I did want to make one additional point, Justice Ginsburg, in response to the question you posed about the applicability of Hartman, which is that at one level it applies, the rule should apply, because the same concern with complex causation is at issue here at well -- as well. But the other way to think about the applicability of Hartman is to -- is to put these cases on a spectrum. On one end, you have what the Court in Hartman identified as a standard retaliation case, of which the Court identified public employment as the archetypal example. And on the other end, you have retaliatory prosecution, where the Court thought that there were sufficient concerns about complicated causation that it made sense to have an across-the-board objective rule. Now, the question could be where does retaliatory arrest fit within that spectrum? Is it on the retaliatory prosecution side or is it on the public employment side? And for a couple of reasons, I think it fits decidedly within the retaliatory prosecution side. One is the one I've given, which is that speech can legitimately be taken into account. And so, it creates complex causation. But the other one is in some sense the flip side of that, which is that in the -- in public employment context, the standard fact pattern is going to involve a long-term relationship between an employer and an employee, during which time there's been no adverse action; the employee then engages in some sort of expressive activity, in the aftermath of which the employer undertakes some adverse action such as a termination. Now, in that context it makes sense to infer that there may well be an illegitimate speech -- speech-suppressive motivation at work, because you have in some sense a control period in the interactions between the employer and the employee that pre-dated the expressive activity. That's not the case when you're dealing with law enforcement. In the law enforcement context in the main, this is a one-time interaction between an officer and a suspect, the arrestee. You don't have the prior relationship that acts as a control. And so, you have to ask the question whether, based on that one-time relationship, is there a basis for inferring that a speech-suppressive motivation was at work? And here, because it can be legitimate for an officer to take into account speech in deciding whether this situation is the kind of one in which a law enforcement response is warranted, it makes sense, unlike in the public employment context, to apply the same objective across-the-board screen in the form of a no-probable-cause requirement that you have in prosecutions.",
  "It was not, Your Honor. Of course, that's exactly what happens in the Fourth Amendment context. That's -- that was the issue before the Court in Devenpeck, and the Court explained in Devenpeck why it makes sense to have an objective probable cause inquiry rather than a subjective one.",
  "I don't know the reason that a -- I don't know the precise contours of the harassment charges in State court that were made. I think that they mapped on in some measure to the assault, the assault that was suspected by the -- by Officer Reichle, who effected the arrest. Now, I think the concern with importing some sort of subjective probable cause dimension into the inquiry -- if you asked, you know, what offense did the officer in fact have in mind, it's the same concerns that drove the Court to apply an objective rule in Devenpeck, including, for example, that you would have dis-uniformity, in that similarly situated individuals would be treated differently based purely on what happens to have been in an officer's mind. Thank you.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court's decisions have long established that Congress will be deemed to have waived the Government's sovereign immunity only if it unequivocally expresses its intent to do so.",
  "There are such statutes, Justice Sotomayor. Of course --",
  "Well, they would have two features consistent with this Court's decisions that have found the Tucker Act to be applicable. One would be that the statute does not contain its own remedial mechanism, and the second would be that the substantive obligations in the statute run against the United States, and the United States alone. And an example of that type of statute is the one that this Court found to be supported by the Tucker Act in White Mountain Apache Tribe or in Mitchell II. Those are the kinds of statutes as to which I think the Tucker Act was meant to apply.",
  "Well, of course --",
  "It does when they're dealing with the statute like this. And, of course, the reason that we’re addressing Tucker Act immunity is because Tucker Act immunity is the basis for jurisdiction in this case according to the reasoning of the Federal circuit. And the problem with the reasoning of the Federal circuit is it allows the litigant to readily circumvent the Court's strict test for sovereign immunity waivers by the straightforward device of adding the Tucker Act as a jurisdictional basis in the complaint. And it's not at all clear why a plaintiff couldn't do that for any claim under any statute, including a statute as to which this Court would have already concluded that the unequivocal expression test, the standard test applied for waivers of sovereign immunity, was not satisfied. Now, to give the Court a concrete example of this, in Lane v. Pena, the court concluded that for Rehabilitation Act claims under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, there was no unequivocal expression of an intent to waive sovereign immunity by Congress for purposes of damages claims; and, therefore, a damages claim can't be brought against the United States under Section 504. But under the Federal circuit's approach, there’s no apparent reason why a plaintiff couldn't bring a damages claim against the United States for a violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by adding the Tucker Act to the jurisdictional bases in the complaint. Because if the plaintiff were able to do that, notwithstanding this Court's decision in Lane V. Pena, the result would be that the plaintiff could say, the Federal circuit, you should look at the statute and ask the question whether it can be fairly interpreted to mandate the payment of money by the Government. There’s no unequivocal expression of an intent to waive sovereign immunity, but that doesn't detract from the ability of the Federal circuit to conclude that the statute, nonetheless, can be fairly interpreted to mandate the payment of money. Now, of course, if that issue were to arise, we would make the argument that the statute can't be so read. But the possibility that a plaintiff could make that argument, notwithstanding this Court's decision in Lane V. Pena, we think reinforces the need to conclude -- to conclude that the Tucker Act can't be applied in the way that the Federal circuit sought to apply it here.",
  "Sure.",
  "Well, the --",
  "I think one -- one way to look at the FLSA, if we're looking at it in the first instance, would be to conclude that the FLSA itself has a waiver of sovereign immunity. And so you wouldn't look to the Tucker Act as the basis for the waiver of sovereign immunity, and you would look at FSLA in the way that we think you should look at FCRA -- excuse me, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA. Now, Your Honor is correct that there is a body of court of claims jurisprudence that doesn't necessarily view the statute in that way. But if you apply the framework that we think is the correct one to apply, as we set forth in our brief, you might reach the same conclusion under the Fair Labor Standards Act, although under a slightly different route.",
  "Well, it would depend. There is a little bit of an anomaly in the FLSA because the FLSA doesn't necessarily point to any particular court as the basis of jurisdiction.",
  "Right. It says: \"In any Federal or state court of competent jurisdiction,\" but this statute specifically allows for claims to be brought in district courts and a court of competent jurisdiction. So one way --",
  "Well, I think one way to potentially see the difference -- and I'm not going to quibble with -- with what Your Honor's saying, but one way to potentially see a difference is because the FLSA only refers to courts of competent jurisdiction -- it doesn't have a free-standing provision that reversed the district courts -- it's possible to read that statute as essentially incorporating the Tucker Act as setting forth what the court of competent jurisdiction would be. Here, 1681(p), which is set forth at 13(a) and 14(a) of the appendix to the Government's brief, speaks specifically about actions being brought under FCRA in any appropriate United States District Court, and then only, it goes on to talk about, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction. So that's a potential basis for drawing a distinction between the two.",
  "Sure. I do, Your Honor. The text of the Tucker Act, it's true, if you read the text to apply to its full potential reach, then the argument would be more difficult; but, the text of the Tucker Act has never been read that way, including by this Court itself, starting with Nichols v. United States --",
  "Well, I guess --",
  "Sure. I guess you -- you -- if you read the Tucker Act to its full textual reach, I think we would have a more difficult case. But our argument is that when the statute refers to claims founded on any act of Congress, it was never intended to apply literally to any conceivable act of Congress. And, in fact, this Court's own test for money mandating -- the money mandating test that applies to the Tucker Act embodies that understanding because --",
  "We're appealing - -",
  "We're certainly relying on that, Justice Scalia, when you're asking whether the Tucker Act can be used as the basis for waiving sovereign immunity for claims under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. So when you bring the Fair Credit Reporting Act into play, yes, we're absolutely relying on the specific versus the general proposition, as this Court has relied on in any number of cases. I guess I understood Justice Kagan's question to be talking about the Tucker Act and the Tucker Act alone, without bringing into play any other statute. Now, I take Your Honor's point that it's hard to conceive of the Tucker Act in that kind of isolated fashion, because usually you'll be asking a question whether a claim can be brought against the United States under some other statutory regime. And so if that statutory regime includes its own remedial mechanism, as FCRA does, it's hard to avoid resort to the specific control as a general proposition. But the other point about construing the text of the Tucker Act alone is that the Tucker Act is a waiver of sovereign immunity. And so the canon that we construe waivers of sovereign immunity strictly comes into play when we construe the terms of the Tucker Act itself. And I think it stands to reason that when you apply that canon, you wouldn't read the Tucker Act to encompass fully any act of Congress, because the implications for waivers of sovereign immunity would be quite substantial. And so the Court has never construed the Tucker Act that way, and it shouldn't countenance that kind of construction now, which is effectively what the Federal Circuit's interpretation allows, because, rather than applying the strict standard under which Congress would have to be seen to have unequivocally expressed an intent to waive the Government's sovereign immunity in the terms of FCRA, it allows a plaintiff to avoid that by simply resorting to the Tucker Act in the jurisdictional basis of a complaint, and getting the real act by the Federal Circuit's own description standard that applies to the Tucker Act.",
  "Well, I guess a few responses, Justice Ginsburg. First, on the question of whether the United States is subject to the substantive obligations in FCRA, I don't know that's there's a one size fits all answer. I think you'd have to go provision by provision and make an assessment. And the reason I would say that is that, with respect to certain provisions at least, there are other statutes that, depending on the provision, have a specific obligation against the Government. And I'm thinking in particular of the Debt Collection Improvements Act, the Privacy Act in certain contexts. And so you have -- you have to ask the question whether, with respect to the particular FCRA provision that's alleged to run against the United States, would the better basis for finding the United States' obligations be some other statute that speaks more specifically to the question. So I'm resisting the notion that the -- the FCRA's references to \"person\" in all of its substantive obligations would necessarily encompass the Government. Now, there's at least one provision as to which we don't deny that the Government is covered, and that's 1681(b)(b)(b), and that provision is set forth at pages -- at page 7a of the appendix to the Government's brief. And with respect to the particular provision at issue in this case, the truncation provision, I guess we don't have to confront the question of whether the Government is bound by that provision. It might well be, but we don't have to confront that question, because the Government acts as if it's in compliance with that provision because it has to. There's a series of network agreements that the Government has entered into with credit card companies that allow the Government to participate in the credit card system. As a condition --",
  "1681(b)(b). If you look at --",
  "Well, I'm sorry. It starts at 4a. And the -- 4a, permissible purposes of Government reports; the conditions for furnishing. And then if you go to 7a -- that's also part of (b)(b) -- b(b)4 has an exception for national security investigations. And it talks at (b)(b)(4)(A) about \"in the case of an agency or department of the United States Government which seeks to obtain and use.\" And because there's a reference to the United States Government in that provision --",
  "-- it stands to reason that the term \"person\" in (b)(b) -- which starts at 4a; excuse me -- encompasses the United States Government. I guess the short answer, Justice Ginsburg, is I don't think that there is a one size fits all answer. But the other part of your question is, are we taking the position that even if substantive obligations run against the United States, there still wouldn't be a remedy, at least a remedy in damages against the United States? And the answer to that is yes. But that's not at all atypical under this Court's sovereign immunity jurisprudence, and it's not at all atypical for Congress to have fashioned a scheme that runs in that way. And the Privacy Act at least is one example, where in the Privacy Act, which applies to the Government and the Government alone, there are certain obligations that the Government has to comply with in that statute. But Congress is very careful to cabin the circumstances in which the Government would be subject to liability and money damages.",
  "I think, with respect, Justice Scalia, I think that's a distinction that ultimately doesn't make a difference in the context of this case. In the prior cases in which this Court has applied the specific over the general canon in related contexts, it's true that the statutes in some situations contemplated liability against the United States, but it had -- that statute would have certain limitations. And I'm thinking, for example, of Hinck, of Erika, of Brown v. General Services Administration, cases like that, and Sheehan. And what the Court said was, where a statute provides for liability against the United States, but in certain situations, you don't look to a different statute, the Tucker Act, to circumvent those kinds of limitations.",
  "Well, I guess -- I don't think we need to have that negative implication to that full extent in order to invoke the specific versus the general canon, because the question at the end of the day is what did Congress intend? And where Congress enacts a specific remedial scheme that sets out the extent to which liability will be imposed under, in this case, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, it stands to reason that Congress would have expected courts to look to the remedial scheme that it established to determine to metes and bounds of liability, not to some other general default provision.",
  "And therefore in that sense, the specific remedial scheme that's in the statute should control over some other general scheme that Congress might well not have had in mind at all when it set forward the terms under which claims can be brought under FCRA.",
  "If -- if the statute were that general?",
  "I think I would, because I think in that context, Congress would have made a determination on the scope of liability for claims under that statute. It would have given thought to that issue, and it would have set forth in a very general provision the metes and bounds of the liability. And Congress I think in that context wouldn't have expected anyone to look to the Tucker Act, because Congress gave no indication that it was thinking about the Tucker Act. Now, in Your Honor's hypothetical, if you had a statute that spoke in those kinds of general terms, of course, we'd have I think a very good argument that there would have been no contemplation of a waiver of sovereign immunity. So we would strongly resist the notion that the United States might fall within the compass of that general provision. But on the question of whether you'd look to that general provision as opposed to the Tucker Act, I think you would look to that general provision, because Congress in the context of enacting that statute told everybody: We're defining the extent to which liability can be asserted in court by reference to this general provision; this is where you ought to look, not somewhere else. Now, one other --",
  "It does. I think it does. And I think that's quite a breathtaking proposition, and not one that Congress would have intended by virtue of the Tucker Act --",
  "Well, it would be hard to square that understanding with the way -- with the series of this Court's cases that apply the specific versus general canon, because I think the same argument could have been made in Brown v. General Services Administration, in Erika, in Hinck, that if you thought that the subject --",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "Right.",
  "It -- well, you can look at it that way, Mr. Chief Justice, but I guess my only response --",
  "Well, that's the question because it depends on --",
  "-- it depends on how you construe the Tucker Act. I mean, I think Your Honor is correctly construing the Tucker Act's waiver of sovereign immunity only to apply to a certain limited subset of acts of Congress. And if you construed it in a sufficiently limited way, I suppose we could live with that result. But I think the better way to approach the question is to look at the particular remedial scheme that Congress enacted in the scope of the statute itself. And for purposes of questions of sovereign immunity, you'd look to that particular remedial scheme and ask the age-old question, countenanced by this Court's decisions, of whether there is an unequivocal -- unequivocal expression of an intent to waive sovereign immunity in the scope of that statute itself.",
  "There -- well --",
  "-- not claims in contract, for example. Obviously, if there is an expressed contract with the United States, I don't know that that comes under a statute, necessarily, but --",
  "The just compensation clause. That doesn't come under a statute, it comes under the Constitution, but the Tucker Act can be used.",
  "If that statute -- at least if that statute has its own remedial scheme, then you'd look to the remedial scheme in that statute. But I think this is where I started off with Justice Sotomayor.",
  "Right. And I think there is. I think the -- statutes like the one that this Court had before it in White Mountain Apache Tribe are ones. Another example that I could give the Court is there is a statute that dealt with payment of compensation to prisoners of war. This was the statute that was at issue in Bell v. The United States. I think it's cited in footnote 42 of the Court's opinion in Bowen v. Massachusetts. But that statute specifically set forth that compensation would be owed to prison -- prisoners of war held in captivity. That statute did not have its own remedial scheme. Its substantive obligation ran against the United States, and the United States alone, by nature. And the Tucker Act, I think, in that context would step in to supply a waiver of sovereign immunity and jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims. And the reason is that that statute has the two predicate conditions that we think have to be met in order to even raise the question whether the Tucker Act steps in.",
  "I think that's --",
  "I think that's right, Your Honor, but I'd qualify it in one respect, which is that if -- if the statute contains its own remedial scheme, that's an independent reason for not looking at the Tucker Act.",
  "Right.",
  "That's right. I think you would look to the question of whether there’s been a sufficiently expressed waiver in the terms of the statute itself, which is the traditional test that this Court has applied.",
  "Yes, it would. I think it's easier where you have a remedial scheme, obviously, but I think it's also the case that where the substantive obligation is a generally applicable one and doesn't run against the United States alone, you'd still, I think, want to --",
  "That's true. I mean, but I guess -- you don't have to reach the question of whether the Tucker Act applies or the statute doesn't have its own remedial scheme, obviously, in this case, because FCRA does have its own remedial scheme. Our argument would still apply. And on the question of whether we're reading the Tucker Act in one particular way to a subsets of acts of Congress, I guess one point I'd make is that the money mandating test that this Court has always applied where the Tucker Act does apply already presupposes that it doesn't apply to just any act of Congress, because the act of Congress has to be a money-mandating one.",
  "The last sentence, the last thought at least -- maybe I should try to rephrase it, but the last thought is that this Court's jurisprudence already presupposes that the Tucker Act doesn't apply to every act of Congress because the Court's jurisprudence requires that the act of Congress be money-mandated. So we’re already in a zone in which the Tucker Act's reference to acts of Congress doesn't literally extend to every conceivable act of Congress. It only extends to certain acts of Congress. And I --",
  "I -- if you didn't have -- that's -- that's -- I guess -- if you didn't have the remedial scheme. We don't get to that question, Justice Kennedy, because you only get to the money-mandating question if there is not a remedial scheme in the text of the statute itself and the substantive obligation runs against the United States, and the United States alone, which this one doesn't because it's generally applicable. And it's hard to conceive of that question in the abstract because the question is whether the statute is money-mandating in that it specifically contemplates the payment of money by the United States; and, precisely because the statute is generally applicable, I think we would say that under this statute it's not money-mandating, because it's not money-mandating in that it doesn't contemplate payment by the United States with relevant specificity because the substantive obligation is generally applicable. You only get to that question in a context like White Mountain Apache Tribe or Mitchell II, where the substantive obligation runs against the United States, and the United States alone, and where there’s no remedial scheme embedded within the statute itself. And then you ask the question whether is that kind of substantive obligation that runs against the United States, is that one that's naturally conceived as a money-mandating. And on that, I think you would look at a couple of considerations consistent with this Court's decisions. One is, is the obligation one that necessarily deals with compensation? So, for example, the statute I was referring to earlier that has to do with compensation for -- for imprisoned prisoners of war, that one naturally has to do with compensation, so it might be money-mandating. In White Mountain Apache Tribe and the other trust cases that arise under the Indian Tucker Act, the Court concluded that because background principles of trust law would necessarily contemplate the payment of money, that those statutes are money-mandating. But the principal point here --",
  "-- is you only get to that question if you get past that hurdle.",
  "Well, right, but --",
  "But I think the money-mandating test, Justice Sotomayor, is whether it contemplates the payment of damages by the United States. And I guess that's why I'm having a hard time addressing that question in the abstract, because there’s a predicate condition that hasn't been satisfied. That question only naturally arises where the substantive obligation runs against the United States and the United States alone. I think precisely for the reason that Your Honor says, where the substantive obligation is generally applicable in that it applies to parties beyond the United States, it's hard to ask the question whether the statute is money-mandating in the relevant sense.",
  "That -- I will grant --",
  "Well, I will grant you, Justice Sotomayor, that that hypo is more difficult than this case because, although I would construe that to be generally applicable, it does talk about the Government. It specifically references the Government, and I think, by Your Honor's hypothetical, the United States alone. It's not an undifferentiated reference to persons, which is what you have in FCRA. I still think I would call that generally applicable such that the Tucker Act wouldn't come into play, but I don't deny that it would be a closer case than what you have here. If the Court has no further questions, I would like to reserve the balance of my time.",
  "No, I'm not aware of that situation, and I think that's why you look to this remedial provision that Congress enacted to determine the metes and bounds.",
  "The Privacy Act has its own remedial mechanism within it typically.",
  "Or you don't proceed at all, yeah.",
  "Well, FLSA is a bit complicated, for the reasons I was adverting to earlier. It's -- this Court has never confronted the question of how exactly you go forward under the FLSA. And I think, because of the ambiguity in the courts to which the FLSA refers, for the reasons I was discussing with Justice Sotomayor earlier, I think you could see that statute as incorporating the Tucker Act itself, but that would be something that Congress did.",
  "(u)(i). I think there's several answers to (u)(i). First of all, I'm not sure which way that cuts because the fact -- it may be (u)(l), it may be (u)(i), but (u) -- I'm not sure which way that cuts because, on one hand, the fact that Congress specifically provided for the United States to be liable in certain situations I think cuts in favor of our understanding, not against it. But there's a more fundamental point about the argument that my friend makes on the other side, which is that that statute was enacted, I think, before the civil remedies provisions were expanded to encompass all persons. So it's hard to conclude that that notwithstanding any other provision would have referred to something that came along later. Now, I have two points that I'd like to make in rebuttal, one of which, there's been some questions today about which is the specific statute and which is the general statute. Now, one, I think, clear indication that the specific statute for present purposes should be FCRA is to look at what the Plaintiffs allege. The Plaintiffs are bringing a FCRA claim, and there's no mistake about that, because the Plaintiffs seek the FCRA advantage of statutory damages of at least $100. And so they're grounding their claim in the FCRA cause of action. And I think, therefore, you should look at FCRA to determine whether the Government is liable. And you don't have a situation in which you can mix and match under both; you should look to FCRA to determine whether there's been a clear and express waiver of sovereign immunity. The other point I would like to discuss is something that -- references something Justice Breyer was adverting to earlier, which is even if there was some universe in which you could contemplate a hybridization where you apply the Tucker Act, even though there's a cause of action already in the statute, you wouldn't do so in the context of this case because there are clear indications that Congress wouldn't have contemplated a resort to the Tucker Act. The Tucker Act doesn't apply to torts. This claim is a tort claim. We know this because the Court in Safeco a few terms ago -- this is at 551 U.S. 69 -- specifically referred to the Restatement of Torts as a means of -- interpreting the term willfulness, which is the linchpin for the claim here. I see my time has expired.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a person controls a subordinate's daily work activities and subjects her to harassment, that person qualifies as a supervisor for purposes of the Faragher-Ellerth vicarious liability affirmative defense framework. When it controls daily work activities and, therefore, for example, can compel the cleaning of toilets for a year, the principle that the agency relationship augments the ability to carry out the harassment is implicated in that the victim will lack the same ability to resist the harassment or to report it as would be the case if the harassment were conducted by a coworker that --",
  "Well --",
  "I think it comes out, most likely, against concluding that the person is a supervisor. And the reason is that, under the EEOC enforcement guidance, that accounts for situations in which the authority is exercised over a limited field, a limited number of tasks or assignments. And this is at page 92(a) of the petition appendix. And I think that would qualify under that provision because it's limited.",
  "It could, Your Honor. I don't disagree with that, and I don't disagree that there are going to be cases that raise issues at the margins. But one way to think about the spectrum of options available to the Court today is to envision that on one end, you have harassment that's perpetrated by a coworker, and you consider the types of harassment that that might entail. And on the other end, you have harassment that's perpetrated by a supervisor with authority over tangible employment actions.",
  "Well -- well, I guess, Your Honor, as Your Honor put it to -- to Petitioner's counsel, the competing approach would be the approach adopted by the Seventh Circuit; but, that approach has some serious flaws. For example, it wouldn't cover the supervisor's conduct that was at issue in Faragher itself, where the supervisor threatened that he would make the harassment victim clean the toilets for a year if she didn't succumb to the harassment. And I think that's a pretty significant cost.",
  "Well, we don't -- I guess, we don't know enough about the threat to force her to clean the toilets for a year to know whether it's only one thing. But it could be, for example, that if there -- in the scope of a particular day, you have three particular options as to what you might do, monitor the beach, clean the facilities, including the toilets, or prepare meals, then it's something that covers the entire day.",
  "No, I think that -- I don't think we have an answer to that until we know how much of the day's work is encompassed by cleaning the toilets.",
  "He -- he controlled every aspect of her -- of her day's work, and cleaning the toilets was one aspect of it. So that was a particularly poignant example that he visited on her as a way to perpetuate the harassment.",
  "It doesn't constitute authority over daily work activities. And I guess that's what the EEOC guidance authorities --",
  "We haven't encountered it in real cases.",
  "They haven't, Justice Breyer.",
  "They have not. I'm sorry. They have not turned out to be an issue, and that's what - -",
  "Well, they haven't -- I guess that's two components to the answer, Mr. Chief Justice -- they haven't generated reported or underreported decisions, as far as we've seen. And this is not scientific, and it's just based on our conversations with the EEOC lawyers who are charged with dealing with right to sue letters and the like. They haven't encountered these sorts of situations.",
  "Well, that -- I -- I understand that that's not entirely surprising, but --",
  "Right.",
  "Right. In our conversations with them about the way in which these issues arise --",
  "And I don't think it has, Justice Breyer. And I think it's important to bear in mind that the nature of this inquiry is such that there's going to be cases at the margins that raise difficult questions; but, in Ellerth, the Court recognized that.",
  "That if there's no authority over -- to -- to direct annual employment actions, then --",
  "The professor would not qualify as a supervisor for purposes of Ellerth-Faragher framework.",
  "And so you'd look at it as a -- you'd look at the professor as a coworker, and you'd apply the same standards that applied to harassment conducted by the coworker.",
  "Yes. And I think that's a useful frame of reference that I was trying to articulate earlier, which is that we can envision the cases as falling on a spectrum between ability to complain when the harassment is perpetrated by a coworker on the one hand, and ability to complain when harassment is perpetrated by a supervisor with tangible employment authority --",
  "The Seventh Circuit would say that as far as we can tell. They don't appear to have a proviso for circumstances in which the harasser has a role in determining tangible employment actions, because that is one thing that the EEOC guidance takes account of. It's that -- not just that somebody counts as a supervisor when they themselves undertake tangible employment action, but if they have a substantial role in making recommendations that in turn trigger tangible employment actions, the EEOC would take the position that that qualifies. Now, that's not an issue in this case, but that's --",
  "Well, I think that the -- control over daily work activities is where we would draw the line. And that's what has come up the most in the cases. The reported decisions have conflicts on -- have a conflict on that issue, and that is where the EEOC guidance draws the line. Now, I think it would be helpful, if the Court were going to issue an opinion that adopts that line, to elaborate on -- on that line a little bit in the following sense: That relaying instructions that are -- that are disseminated by one person wouldn't count for those purposes. That's in the EEOC guidance. And -- and it's the functions of a job that actually matter, not the job title. That is also in the EEOC guidance. So I think there are some aspects of the EEOC guidance that elaborate on that line about control over daily activities that I think I would commend to the Court, that it might well --",
  "I'm sorry? I didn't hear you.",
  "I think -- I think the real question, Justice Sotomayor, is whether the parties had a sufficient opportunity to develop the record. Because if you take the record in the case as a given, we think that the record would support the grant of summary judgment for Ball State University, because there isn't a sufficient showing in the record if you take it as a given that the relevant supervisory -- the relevant putative supervisory employee, Davis, had control over day-to-day work activities. The question that remains is whether the record should be allowed to be expanded.",
  "No. I think if you take the record as a given, that a grant of summary judgment in favor of the employer would be in order. But in the normal course what this Court does when it announces a new standard is it remands for the lower courts to deal with the application of the standard to the facts. And the conclusion in our brief is just, I think, a parroting of that normal conclusion.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it Please the Court: The National Voter Registration Act aims to streamline the process of registration for applicants, and the provisions that provide for the establishment of a Federal form embody that objective. And I'd like to point to three features of the relevant statutory language that I think support our reading. And the particular critical provision is at page 22A of the appendix to the government's brief. And I'm sorry, I know that the provisions are located in a number of areas, but the gray brief at page 22A has the critical provision in our view, which is one that Ms. Millett was pointing to. And that's gg-7(b)(1). Now, what this provision embodies is this understanding: That the EAC is the one who determines what the content of the Federal form is. Not the States, but the EAC. The States do have a role in this scheme, and I think it's important to understand what that role is. The States have a consultative role at the front end. And this is back at page 21A -- I'm sorry for skipping back. But at page 21A at the bottom of the page, the EAC is to develop a form in consultation with the chief election officers of the States.",
  "I don't think it is, Justice Scalia, but I think the problem with that is in the premise. I grant you that the statute says \"may require,\" but it says \"may require only,\" and I think the only fair way to read this provision is that the commission is to require the information that's necessary, but --",
  "It \"may require only,\" in effect, means shall require information that's necessary, but may only require that information. I think the statute would make very little sense if the EAC discharged its statutory responsibility by having a Federal form that required nothing other than the name. That wouldn't be within anybody's conceivable conception of a rational objective of Congress that would enable the EAC to satisfy --",
  "But I think the whole point of this, Justice Scalia -- and this is where I started, with all due respect -- is to come forward with a Federal form that streamlines the process of registration for applicants. And if the regime that resulted were one in which the Federal form served very little purpose other than to set a floor, but then each of the 50 States could superimpose whatever additional requirements they wanted to, I think that would largely defeat the entire purpose of the Federal form.",
  "I don't think so, Justice Breyer.",
  "Coupled with the statutory objective because what this provision says is that the EAC, in consultation with the States, is supposed to create a form that imposes the following burden on individuals, on individuals. That's the key.",
  "Sure.",
  "Correct.",
  "I do think that that's what Congress contemplated was necessary, but it's not to the exclusion of this, which is that if a State comes forward to the EAC, which is a body that's charged with responsibility for defining the contents of the Federal form, and says we think something more is necessary. Take a look at what we want to submit to you, and you should amend the Federal form, or you should at least amend our State-specific portion of the Federal form to include this requirement in it, the EAC could make that determination. Congress made that responsibility --",
  "No, Justice -- Justice Ginsburg, to be clear, I don't -- I don't think General Horne will disagree with this, the executive director initially responded to the request by rejecting it, but it did go to the full Commission, and at that point, there was a fully-constituted Commission. The Commission divided by a vote of 2-2. And so in that instance, the Commission took no action. But a 2-2 vote is a -- qualifies as a rejection. And that is something that could -- potentially could have been the subject of judicial review. Now, I'm obviously not going to give away any Federal defenses, but --",
  "Well, that --",
  "I mean, obviously, I'd respectfully disagree with that. I think we'll be in perfectly good shape. And I think part of the reason is that this -- requiring a statement under penalty of perjury is the traditional way in which States enforce their qualifications. The legislative history shows that Congress understood that that was the traditional way. What the State seeks to do here is do something over and above the traditional way to enforce qualifications.",
  "Well, Louisiana is not -- is not citizenship-specific, Your Honor, as Ms. Millett was pointing out --",
  "That's correct. And that was submitted to the EAC, and the EAC approved of it. And I think that's the critical distinction here.",
  "Because the statute -- the statute seeks to streamline registration, but it's not an objective to the exclusion of all other objectives. And the EAC is charged with balancing the various competing statutory objectives. And it concluded in – with respect to the Louisiana submission -- that that one was okay. I do think that's different. A, because the EAC approved of it; and B, because the specific forms of identification that are outlined in Louisiana addition were exactly those forms of identification that Congress already said was okay at either the registration stage or the voting stage.",
  "Well, I think we are talking about two different things, Justice Scalia. I'm talking about Louisiana.",
  "I was trying to answer the Chief Justice's question. In Arizona, it was 2-2. Now, I want to point out one other critical feature of the statute, and General Horne alluded to this and said that there's no way to look in the statute and see a distinction between on one hand what the individuals can be required to provide, and on the other hand what the State can then do with the individual information to crosscheck it. And the statute presupposes that the State can conduct its own investigation to crosscheck the information that the individual supplies. And maybe the critical provision to see that is at page 19A of the appendix to the government's brief. And that's a provision that deals with a different qualification, felony history. But it operates on this assumption that States can conduct their own investigation, which makes all the sense in the world. This one -- this provision that's in subsection (g) at the top of the page, which is 1973 gg-6(g), what this does is it tells the United States Attorney's Offices that when there is a Federal conviction of a felony, the U.S. Attorney's Offices are supposed to give written notice of that conviction to the chief State election official. And what's the State -- chief State election official going to do with that? Well of course, what they're going to do is they're going to take a look at the Federal form, they're going to see what the individual said about their felony history, and they're going to crosscheck it – against the information that they got from the United States Attorney -- to make sure that the information on the form is accurate.",
  "Here is the sense it would make -- even if -- if Arizona had the authority to add to the Federal requirements on its own State form, the sense it would make is this: That the Federal form always operates as a floor. It's always there for somebody to use to register, regardless of what the State form might do in addition. And that has -- I take Your Honor's assumption -- if I can just briefly finish -- I understand Your Honor's point that there is a practical question about whether that would ever be practical or useful, given that an individual will want to use the State form for State, local and Federal elections, but there is also the -- the well-understood practice of organizations that go out to register individuals to vote. And they can use the Federal form, and the Federal form would suffice.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has jurisdiction in this case based on the petition filed by the United States for the same reasons it had jurisdiction in parallel circumstances in Chadha and Lovett. There are two issues that have been -- that have been brought up this morning and I'd like to address each in turn. One is whether there's a concrete case or controversy -- case or controversy in the sense of adversity in this Court. And the second is the question of whether there's Article III standing for the government to bring this case before the Court.",
  "Where the parties agreed --",
  "Well, you didn't speak to it in Lovett, Your Honor, but that was the circumstance in Lovett.",
  "Well, I don't -- I don't know that that matters because you had to satisfy Article III prerequisites to have the case in this Court. Now, Your Honor is, of course, correct that the -- the Court didn't affirmatively engage on the issue of jurisdiction, but that is a scenario --",
  "No, I don't know of one. But these -- but, Mr. Chief Justice, with all due respect --",
  "Let me say two things about that if I might, Your Honor. First is that it's -- it's unusual, but that's not at all surprising because the --",
  "Well, it's totally unprecedented in one respect, Your Honor. If you look at Chadha -- okay, the second point I'd make. Let me make one point at the outset, though, which is that whether it's totally unusual or largely unusual, I grant you that it doesn't happen. But the reason it doesn't happen is because -- I wouldn't confuse a numerator with a denominator. This set of circumstances just doesn't arise very often. Now, it's true that when this set of circumstances --",
  "Justice Scalia, one recognized situation in which an act of Congress won't be defended in court is when the President makes a determination that the act is unconstitutional. That's what happened here. The President made an accountable legal determination that this Act of Congress is unconstitutional.",
  "Well, that's an option that's available to him, Justice Kennedy. In certain circumstances, it makes sense not to enforce. But I don't think the take-care responsibility is an all or nothing proposition, such that when the President reaches a determination that a statute is unconstitutional, it necessarily follows that he wouldn't enforce it. That's not what happened in Lovett. That's not --",
  "I -- in the -- in the signing statement situation, Your Honor, one example in the past is Turner Broadcasting. In Turner Broadcasting, that was a circumstance in which it was -- it was a veto, but in the course of the veto the President made the determination that a particular aspect of that statute was unconstitutional. And what happened as a result of that is that the Department of Justice didn't defend that aspect of the statute in litigation. Now, a subsequent President reached a contrary conclusion. But -- but my point is simply that when the President makes a determination that a statute is unconstitutional, it can follow that the Department of Justice won't defend it in litigation.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I'd hesitate to give you a black-and-white algorithm. There are -- there are several considerations that would factor into it. One of the considerations --",
  "No, no. Of course --",
  "28 U.S.C. 530(d) presupposes -- Congress presupposes that there are going to be occasions in which a statute is -- is not defended because of a conclusion by the Attorney General that it's unconstitutional.",
  "It could be, but this is a situation in which the President made the determination. And when the President makes that determination, there are a few considerations that I think would factor into the mix in determining whether enforcement will follow. One of them would be the consequences of enforcement for the individuals who are affected. And so, for example, I would assume that if it's a criminal statute that we're talking about, an enforcement would require criminal enforcement against somebody and -- which would beget criminal sanctions. That may be --",
  "There have -- Justice Scalia --",
  "-- there have been occasions in the past.",
  "Yes. Yes, it's true. And 28 U.S.C. 530(d) exactly presupposes that. That's the exact occasion in which that process is -- is occasioned. Congress knew that this would happen. Now, it can happen also when -- in the rare instance in which the President himself makes that determination. And I don't think that the take-care clause responsibility has this all or nothing capacity to it. It can be that the President decides --",
  "It can be that the President decides to enforce it. That's what happened in Lovett and that's the course of events that was sought -- that happened in Chadha. And there's --",
  "Correct.",
  "Well, there are -- there are a number of considerations that could factor into it, Justice Ginsburg. You're right that either of those scenarios is possible. The reason that the government appealed in this case is because the President made the determination that this statute would continue to be enforced, and that was out of respect for the Congress that enacted the law and the President who signed it, and out of respect for the role of the judiciary in saying what the law is. The point of taking an appeal here is that the government suffered an injury because a judgment was entered against the government in the court of appeals. That's a classic case for injury.",
  "I -- I won't, Your Honor. I'll be happy to turn -- turn to BLAG standing. I would like to make a couple of points on the question of our own standing to bring the petition before the Court. And I think Justice Breyer was right. The key precedent here is Chadha. Chadha establishes a couple of things. First, Chadha establishes that there is aggrievement in the circumstances of this case. And I don't see what the difference is between aggrievement, for purposes of statutory -- the statutory analysis at issue in Chadha, and injury, for purposes of Article III.",
  "I guess we'd -- I'd subscribe to the aggrievement analysis that the Court made in Chadha at pages 929 to 931 of its opinion. And what the Court said is this: \"When an agency of the United States is a party to a case in which an act of Congress that it administers is held unconstitutional, it is an aggrieved party. The agency's status as an aggrieved party is not altered by the fact that the Executive may agree with the holding that the statute in question is unconstitutional.\" That description is on all fours with the circumstances of this case.",
  "Correct.",
  "Well --",
  "We represent the sovereign interests of the United States. Of course, in a case like this, the -- the -- we're submitting the dispute to the Judiciary for resolution, so in that sense, we -- I'm not going to stand here and tell you that I can dictate the -- that the Judiciary comes out in one direction or the other. I certainly would like to be able to do that, but I don't think I can, in all fairness, do that. But I --",
  "Well, I think -- I guess what I would say is this, the United -- the United States -- the Executive Branch represents the sovereign interests of the United States before the Court. It's not -- I think the point of this is that it's not that the Executive Branch is representing the Executive Branch alone. The Executive Branch is representing the sovereign interests of the United States. And those interests would include the interests of the Congress that enacted the law, the interests of the President that signed it, and the interests of the Judiciary in pronouncing on what the law is. And the course of action that the President chose to undertake here is in keeping with all of those considerations.",
  "Yes.",
  "I don't -- I don't know why Chadha didn't engage on it in particular. I think part of it, Justice Kagan, is that the Court didn't have the methodology at that point in time that it does now. I don't know that it neatly divided between those questions in the same way. So yes, it left the Article III question open, but I think the question of Article III injury necessarily follows from aggrievement and I haven't -- I haven't heard a persuasive argument to the contrary. If we were aggrieved in the circumstances of Chadha, it seems to me it necessarily follows that we're injured. We're injured in a couple of ways. An act of Congress has been declared unconstitutional, which Chadha itself says constitutes aggrievement and therefore constitutes injury. In this case also, we're required to pay a judgment --",
  "I'm sorry?",
  "There wasn't a -- there -- that was an issue in Chadha. I don't know that that issue was joined, actually, Justice Scalia. The Court did say, at page 939 of its opinion, that Congress is a proper party to defend the constitutionality of the Act and a proper petitioner, and I think that's the best language for the other side on this issue.",
  "Well, I don't -- I don't read the --",
  "I didn't -- to be -- to be fair or, as was suggested this morning, to be crickets, I -- I didn't mean to suggest that Lovett is binding precedent, Mr. Chief Justice. What I'm saying is Lovett is a case in which this same scenario as happens here occurred. That's my -- that's my point about Lovett.",
  "So -- sure.",
  "Right. Well --",
  "I think that --",
  "Sure. So there are two aspects of Chadha that are relevant on pages 939 and 940. The second discussion at page 940, I think, deals with prudential considerations that this Court ought to take into account to make sure that it has a sufficient adverse presentation of the competing arguments before it. And that's accounted for by an amicus type role, and I think that's what the Court had in mind in Chadha because the two cases that are cited in support of that proposition were both cases in which there was an appointed amicus. So that -- that deals with that aspect of Chadha. The other aspect of Chadha is the sentence that I alluded to earlier. And I guess I'm not -- I'm not going to tell you that that sentence doesn't bear on the issue at all, but I will say this, what's cited in that sentence is 28 U.S.C. 1254. So I think the point that was directly -- directly being made is that the House and Senate were parties for purposes of the statute and they were parties because they had intervened and so they had party status.",
  "No. I guess my -- my point is a little bit different. My point is that this was talking about whether they're a party for statutory purposes under 1254. I don't read this to address the question of Article III standing. On the question of Article III standing, I guess what I would say is this, Chadha at most, if it says anything about Article III standing -- and I don't know that it does with respect to the House or Senate -- at most what it would say was in the unique circumstances of that case, where you had a legislative veto that uniquely affected a congressional prerogative --",
  "-- there might be standing in that situation. Even that I don't want to concede, but --",
  "I'm conceding that at most --",
  "Well, there are two different cases. This case is different because this case doesn't involve the kind of unique congressional prerogative that was at issue in Chadha. Chadha involved a legislative veto. Here, if I could just finish this --",
  "-- this thought. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Here, I don't think the interest that's being asserted is even in the same plane as the one that was asserted and found deficient in Raines v. Byrd.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress's comprehensive program to address the worldwide problem of HIV and AIDS includes a policy of opposing prostitution and sex trafficking because they contribute to the diseases' spread. And correspondingly, Congress determined -- determined that the government should partner with and should grant limited competitive Federal funding to those organizations that agree with the policy opposing prostitution and sex trafficking because organizations that agree with that policy are most likely to carry out the Federal program in conformity with the Federal policy priorities. Now, no organization that carries out HIV programming is required to subscribe to the Federal government's views, but, if an organization wants to partner with the Federal government and get Federal funds to carry out the Federal program, well, that organization --",
  "Well, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, the way that Congress looked at this was to look at -- at the organizations with which the government is going to partner across the mine run of situations, and I think what one can do is look at Respondents' brief because Respondents encompass a variety of different types of organizations. But Respondents' brief itself tells you, at pages 11 to 12 and at pages 32 and 33, that there are going to be situations, in their own experience, in which these issues about prostitution and --",
  "-- and sex trafficking come into issue.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, I think that would present a different question. Of course, you know that it presents a different question, but it would be a little bit more difficult for the -- for the following reason: That there is a germaneness component to Congress's -- the constitutionality of Congress's funding decisions in this area. And the more sweeping and the less germane the condition would be, the more it's open to constitutional attack. Now, this condition is very, very germane because as -- because, as Congress found, prostitution and sex trafficking contribute to the spread of the disease, and so it makes good sense that Congress would have imposed this condition. And I think it's important to understand --",
  "Well, Justice Breyer, I don't think so, and two responses on that score. First of all, everybody is not telling you that, and I'll tell you who's not telling you that in a second. But the more -- but the overarching point is that this is a policy determination that Congress, of course, took into account when it fashioned the statute, and it concluded that it was important to have an opposition to prostitution and sex trafficking. Now, as far as the organizations that aren't telling you that, there is an amicus brief that's filed by 46 organizations that it's in our support --",
  "-- that's in our support, and the lead organization is the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, and they -- they support us, and they think that the best way -- and they -- and they argued this passionately in their brief -- they think that the best way to provide services to the target audience is under a rubric of opposition to prostitution and sex trafficking. And I would urge you to take a look at that brief because it explains why the program should be conducted in this fashion. Now, is there a debate about --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, if I could just fight the premise of your question just very slightly and then explain why I think this kind of requirement makes sense in this particular context? The goal of this is not to persuade somebody to change their view. The goal of this is to partner with organizations that self-identify as organizations that agree with the government's policy priorities. And the reason the government has done that and the reason why Congress could’ve thought that that was a good idea is straightforward, and that is that those organizations that agree with Congress's policy priorities are going to be more likely to be reliable and effective partners in carrying out the government's program. And one way to think about it is to envision this: You have a circumstance in which you're down to your last few dollars of a discretionary Federal funding, and you're looking at two different organizations that are competing for that money. One of them comes to you and says, we agree with your policy of an opposition to prostitution and sex trafficking; and the other one says, we're not going to tell you whether we agree, we're going to remain studiously neutral, but we'll tell you that we'll conduct our affairs in a manner that's not inconsistent with your policy priorities. I think it makes all the sense in the world for Congress to decide that the government should preferably partner with the former organization, rather than the latter, because they're going to be more reliable and more effective at carrying out the government's program. And there's another aspect of this that I think that is important to highlight, and that is that we're not just talking about circumstances in which the conduct is -- is, arguably, going to be neutral, so that there's going to be no position taken. There's also going to be occasions in which the organizations that are providing services are going to have the opportunity to affirmatively embrace the government's policy in opposition to prostitution and sex trafficking.",
  "There -- there is germaneness, Justice Alito, and I can point to a couple of other limiting principles that have been noted in this Court's decisions and I think that are satisfied here. One is that Finley talked about -- and I think it captures some other decisions in this -- this respect, disallowing the government from leveraging its control over funding conditions in a manner that services a speech-suppressive objective. And so you have to be careful, and I think this maps --",
  "It -- it -- the government is limited from leveraging its control over funding conditions, so that it can achieve a speech -- speech-suppressive objective. And I think what the Court was getting at is that you want to be careful that the speech condition -- the speech-related condition is tightly tethered to the programmatic objective and not allow the government to -- to have the program seep into other areas where it doesn't have to go.",
  "With -- with certain limitations. I mean, I think germaneness is a -- is a criterion.",
  "Well, I think --",
  "Well, I -- well, I'm not sure, Justice Alito, and of course it's going to be hard for me to decide that we are not going to defend something. But let me just give you a limiting idea that's out there, which is that I think there is an important distinction between circumstances in which the government is partnering with an organization to carry out a government program and circumstances in which the government is extending a Federal subsidy to an individual organization as kind of an across-the-board entitlement. So in the generally applicable across-the-board --",
  "Well, I don't know that it the differs from giving the money to do the job. I guess what I'm saying is there are going to be circumstances, for example, like in Speiser, where the financial question doesn't have to do with the expenditure of the money by the recipient in a manner that's commensurate with congressional goals. In that context, you're giving a generally applicable entitlement, and you're not so worried about how the money is being spent because that person is not partnering with the government in carrying out a Federal program. Here, the organizations are partnering with the government in carrying out the Federal program because it's the Federal HIV program that's --",
  "Yes.",
  "They are given money to carry out --",
  "But in concert with Federal policy priorities, so it's not just -- it's not just a naked grant of money. If you had an entitlement, Justice Scalia, for example, let's just consider your classic entitlement --",
  "To implement a particular program and --",
  "I do.",
  "Okay. My apologies for that. For associating with the organization recipient in carrying out a Federal program.",
  "Yes. That's true, Justice Ginsburg. But here's why --",
  "Well, here's why I think it makes sense in this context -- it is distinct in that respect, but here's why I think it makes sense in this specific context: What Congress wanted to do is secure an ex ante commitment from the organizations with which the government works to assure that they agreed with the government's policy priorities. Now, where these programs are carried out is in the main, in foreign territory, in distant lands, and, in that context, I think Congress would have understood that monitoring of conduct can be particularly challenging. And that monitoring is made all the more challenging because these issues can come into play through a myriad of interactions between the organizations that are working with the government and the local communities and local officials.",
  "I think I do.",
  "For the following reasons, Justice Breyer: There is an alternative affiliated organizational vehicle in this case as well, and I think that's constitutionally significant. Now, I'm not going to quibble with Your Honor's point about how the organization that's the funding recipient has made this policy agreement and that that can have ripple effects. But here's why that matters: The point of having an alternate vehicle is not that it remedies a constitutional problem that already exists. The point of it is to get to this leveraging purpose that I was talking about earlier, and it's to show that what the government is doing is keeping the condition within its appropriate confines, and it's not allowing that condition to spread beyond that, into other realms. And that purpose is fully served by the organizational affiliate alternative here. And I think it's important --",
  "Well, Justice Ginsburg, I guess it depends on which direction it runs as a principal point. I mean, of course, the recipient organization that's been conducting the program, to date, can continue to conduct the program, and the affiliate that's set up could be the alternate channel. And so you could run in the opposite direction, and I think you wouldn't run into that problem. But I would like to address on this score an important point, which is that I think Respondents have suggested that there is a material distinction between, Justice Breyer, the circumstances in Rust and the circumstances in this case because Rust involves separate programs within a legal entity, and this case involves separate organizations. And I think the point the Respondents are trying to make is that there is a distinction because at least, there, one legal entity could have multiple programs, some of which are subject to the condition and some of which are not, whereas, here, there is a difference because this condition applies to an entire organization. But I think that's a false premise, which --",
  "Okay.",
  "I guess I'd -- I'd make two points, Justice Breyer. One is, as I was suggesting earlier, the purpose of having this alternate channel is not to remedy a constitutional violation that otherwise would exist. I mean, of course, we start from the premise that it's okay to require this condition at the front end. It's not that it's unconstitutional, and the way to compensate for that is to create this affiliate alternative. We think the condition's okay ab initio. What the alternate vehicle does is to address this other problem, that it shows that the condition is appropriately tailored. It's not reaching beyond its appropriate confines because it's allowing --",
  "Well --",
  "Well, it’s part of the -- as part of the constitutional analysis, I guess it's just addressing a different part of the constitutional analysis than -- than what Your -- Your Honor is addressing. I guess the other points that I'd make are twofold. One is that I think there is something to the notion that, if the organizations are sufficiently separate, then -- as they have to be, to comply with the regulations -- then it does work that one organization can say that we have a particular policy, and the organization -- another organization -- another organization can say that we have a different policy, precisely because of the premise that they're sufficiently distinct. So I'm not seeing the same degree of cognitive dissonance you are --",
  "-- and the other point I'd make --",
  "Thank you, Justice Sotomayor. The other point I'd make is this: That the speech-related objections that Respondents levy are twofold, one is they complain about the threshold condition. But the second is -- and this is -- made -- manifests at pages 11 to 12 and 32 and 33 of their brief -- is that they want to engage in activities that involve affirmative speech. They want to be able to participate in the dialogue about prostitution and sex trafficking and whether they should be legalized. And, with respect to that aspect of what Respondents are complaining -- complaining about, I think the alternate affiliated organization opportunity is a perfect remedy, in the same way that it was in Rust and in the same way that it -- that it was in Regan.",
  "Justice Sotomayor --",
  "I -- I'd certainly understand why a church would be reluctant to do that. I mean, I guess -- you know, one way to look at it is that the city, I think, would have to think very long and hard about whether that's a -- a desirable policy objective, precisely because some of the organizations with which it wants to work are going to have difficulty abiding by it. And so there's going to have to be a front-end determination, as a matter of policy, about whether that's an appropriate thing to pursue. But, if the city, as Congress did in this case, thought that it was an appropriate thing to do, then I think I would -- I think I would defend that -- apart from -- you know, free exercise issues of other things that aren't in play here -- I think I would defend it, as long as it's sufficiently germane and as long as it's in furtherance of the policy objectives that Congress -- or by, in your hypothetical, the city --",
  "I don't know that it would, Justice Alito, on that --",
  "-- because -- because I think, first of all, it would depend on whether there -- there is the requisite germaneness. It would depend on whether, in fact, the organizations are working with -- I'm trying to avoid using the word \"partnering with\" -- but are working with the -- the government in carrying out the program. It would depend on those kinds of considerations. And whether -- another point to be made here is that a limitation that's been recognized in this Court's cases is that, at the end of the day, the government -- the government can't be seeking to suppress speech or to suppress disfavored viewpoints, even in the context of subsidization. And you'd have to ask the question whether that scheme is designed to do that. Now, if -- if it crossed all those thresholds, then I think, yes, I would defend that as well, but I do think that it presents different and more difficult questions. I would like to --",
  "I don't know that I have a particular case, other than the doctrine, generally, Justice Kennedy. But I do think that the foreign location of this is significant vis-à-vis the concern that I think many of you have raised about why have an affirmative condition that requires espousal of a policy. Precisely because the conduct here is carried out in foreign areas and precisely because it can involve myriad interactions with local officials and local policymakers, as Respondents admittedly want to do, on these sensitive questions, it makes sense in this context -- particular sense in this context to secure an ex ante commitment of agreement with the government's policy because that will have a self-policing aspect to it. It will be more designed to secure conduct in those areas that, in conformity with Federal policy, in a realm in which that conduct is particularly -- particularly difficult to monitor. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal, if I might.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a -- a few points in rebuttal. First, by -- by way of characterizing this requirement, I think there has been a suggestion made that what we are trying to do is impose a viewpoint on organizations. This is not a matter of imposing a viewpoint on somebody. It's a matter of picking organizations with which to work who self-identify as having views that are commensurate with the government's views, so that they will be reliable in carrying out the government's program. Now, Justice Kennedy, you'd asked about why -- whether the foreign context of the case--",
  "Because it goes to the -- the limitation that the Court has imposed in its decisions about leveraging funding so as to suppress viewpoints. That's not what's going on here. This is not a case in which funding is being leveraged to suppress a viewpoint. It's a case in which we are trying to get an ex ante determination of whether the organizations that are going to carry out the Federal program agree with our policies. If they do, they can participate --",
  "I don't think --",
  "It's not -- Justice Alito, with all respect, I don't think it's trying to change their viewpoint. I think if they decide, later on, that they would affirm to us that they agree with the policy at that point in time, well, we may -- we may take that observation and engage them. But I don't think that effort is to try to change their viewpoint. It's to try to get them to self -- to self-identify that they are going to be reliable in carrying out the government program. Justice Kennedy, you'd asked the question about whether the foreign context matters, and I talked about why it matters, in the sense that monitoring can be challenging in this context. It also matters in another sense, that I should add, which is that, when the organizations are doing this work in those areas, they are identified as working with the United States government. There is a statutory provision at 291(a) of the Petition Appendix, which is 22 U.S.C. 7611(h), and that requires the global AIDS coordinator to develop a message that enhances awareness by program recipients that the program is an effort on behalf of the citizens of the United States. So there is a real perception out there that, when the organization is carrying out its functions, it's doing so at the behest of the United States citizens. And part of what Congress wanted to do was to avoid a misimpression about why -- about what the United States' policy priorities are. And one way to do that is to assure that the organizations with which the United States works share the United States' policy commitment against prostitution and sex trafficking.",
  "Justice Sotomayor, Congress is not required to -- to pursue every objective, no matter what the cost may be. The Court confronted a similar situation in Regan. That case involved an exemption for veterans. The Court applied a rationality standard and said -- said that was fine. And there's, certainly, a rationale here --",
  "Justice Ginsburg, I think the exemption for these organizations makes good sense if you consider the character of the organizations. Three of the four are -- have members that are sovereign entities. And so one can understand --",
  "Can I just finish this thought? One can understand why Congress would have wanted to tread with sensitivity when -- when we are dealing with foreign countries, especially foreign countries that have different views about prostitution. And there's less of a danger -- and this is the final point -- there's less of a danger in that context that those entities' views are going to be misattributed to the United States precisely because they are foreign countries."
