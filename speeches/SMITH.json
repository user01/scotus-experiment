  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves pregnant women who sought medical care at a public hospital and who then were searched by their doctors for evidence of crimes and arrested, seven of them right out of their hospital beds. The special needs exception does not apply to this case to excuse the lack of warrants for three reasons. First, unlike every other special needs case, the threat of law enforcement, the use of arrest as leverage was the key element of the policy. It was, in the respondent's own words, what made the policy effective. Second, the searches were conducted here in the context of the private, physician-patient relationship and thus there was no diminished expectation of privacy, again, unlike the other special needs cases. And finally, the defendants here skirted the warrant and probable cause requirements without demonstrating impracticability.",
  "If there were no law enforcement scheme there would be a search that was being done, but it would be a search that was only done for medical purposes, Your Honor, and therefore, as it was before the policy was --",
  "-- implemented, right, and therefore it would have been consented to, because there was consent to treatment in that context. But as soon as they incorporated a criminal sanction and made the policy what it was, they had to comply with the Fourth Amendment, and what the warrant --",
  "In some cases there may have been a need to do medical testing. In some cases --",
  "They did medical testing prior to the policy for about 3 to 6 months, Your Honor. They had just started to do testing --",
  "-- pursuant to a listed protocol. As soon as they adopted the policy they -- 3 months later, approximately, they expanded the protocol in order to find more people and really what this policy was about was using arrest as leverage, and they've admitted that in their brief.",
  "Yes.",
  "Mm-hmm.",
  "Mm-hmm.",
  "I don't believe it would have been a violation, Your Honor, if they were testing for medical purposes and discovered evidence of drug use during pregnancy. At that point they have some level of individualized suspicion and reporting to DSS, as they did, for every other substance, for heroin, for methamphetamines -- they didn't report any of those to the police. Reporting those to DSS may meet some kind of reasonable ground standard.",
  "I'm sorry, Your Honor. It's the Department of Social Services, to the civil child abuse authorities.",
  "That's right, Your Honor, but Sitz is --",
  "Well, in fact --",
  "If I understand Your Honor correctly, in Sitz, for example, it's a standardized, nondiscretionary policy, and that I think is what saves it. It's also a minimal intrusion, not a search like we have here, and there's also the diminished expectation of privacy that drivers have, and that this Court has discussed in a number of cases, including Opperman, and in Sitz, whereas in this case we have a discretionary list of criteria where some women who met the criteria were tested. We know in --",
  "I believe on some levels it would be. On the other hand, this is not like Sitz for the other reasons I mentioned. There's a search, not a --",
  "But I don't -- I'm sorry.",
  "I don't believe that there was individualized --",
  "If there was true individualized suspicion, and a search was done and -- just for civil purposes, Your Honor, that might meet Fourth Amendment standards. The lower courts have held civil searches to a lower level than the probable cause standard.",
  "Yes, Your Honor, I'm sorry. The Department of Social Services is the civil child abuse investigatory agency.",
  "Mm-hmm.",
  "If there was a routine program, as Your Honor is presenting it, without a targeted list of criteria, as they had here, a discretionary list of criteria, which is what makes this program so different --",
  "Because when you have a law enforcement --",
  "No, Your Honor. They didn't search everyone. They looked at a targeted list of criteria that included discretionary elements such as inadequate prenatal care, and there's evidence in the record that some people who had inadequate prenatal care were tested and some people who had inadequate prenatal care weren't tested, precisely because the word inadequate is so --",
  "Not --",
  "Not in -- not to be tested for drugs, Your Honor. If you mean just in general are urine samples taken, at some point during the course of prenatal care, I believe they are, but not --",
  "No.",
  "You have to look for it.",
  "You have to search for it, Your Honor, which is what they did here.",
  "Absolutely not, Your Honor. It's a special test that would need to be run on top of what's normally done and, in fact --",
  "They might, Your Honor. I understood Justice O'Connor's question to be, just as a routine matter is it always done.",
  "Because what happened here was, they incorporated a criminal sanction.",
  "The reason they were doing the testing --",
  "Yes, Your Honor.",
  "Could you repeat the question, Your Honor?",
  "That's not the case here, Your Honor, because this is not a case where they were treating people and in the course of medical treatment they came across evidence of a bullet or evidence of drug use. They searched for it. They joined with the police to determine what criteria they were going to use to do the search. It was not a --",
  "Yes.",
  "That's right, Your Honor.",
  "That's right, Your Honor.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Well, that's true, Your Honor, but the difference here is that the search is done specifically to use arrest, to use the criminal sanction and incorporate that into their treatment.",
  "That's right, Your Honor. As soon as they started to search, as soon as they became essentially the police, searching for evidence of a crime, in order to use arrest as leverage they took on a new role and they had to -- they became like a police officer searching a suspect.",
  "I don't know if I understand what you're saying, Your Honor. I'm sorry.",
  "Well, it requires a separate test, Your Honor.",
  "Is that what you mean, or --",
  "That's true, yes, you can test for --",
  "And one of them would be drugs, but it's a specific extra step that's not done unless you meet the criteria, and unless you want to use arrest as leverage.",
  "As far as this policy goes.",
  "Well, the criteria were changed after the policy was instituted.",
  "And there's --",
  "Absolutely. They are not reasonable criteria, Your Honor --",
  "-- and the experts have testified that criteria like inadequate prenatal care, lay prenatal care, preterm labor, these are medical complications of pregnancy --",
  "-- or they're more apt to be indicators of poverty than they are of drug use.",
  "For drug use?",
  "It may have put her at greater risk for other -- not having gotten prenatal care, but it didn't give us any reasonable suspicion, reasonable grounds, probable cause, whatever level of individualized suspicion you're looking for --",
  "I'm sorry, Your Honor.",
  "No other hospitals --",
  "No, Your Honor and, in fact, that's one of the things that shows the discretion. The law enforcement officers in this case went to the one public hospital, joined with doctors at the one public hospital to enforce this policy. They did not enforce this policy at the private hospitals, and they did not --",
  "That's right.",
  "Nobody at another hospital --",
  "That's right, Your Honor --",
  "-- but nobody at another hospital searched their patients in order to use arrest as leverage.",
  "Mm-hmm.",
  "Mm-hmm.",
  "And I think the reason why, Your Honor, is because there's probable cause there. There may be a lower level of suspicion, depending on the circumstances, to report to a civil authority like a Department of Social Services.",
  "Your Honor, the same reasoning --",
  "The same reasoning would apply to searches of people's homes. There's a high crime area, we know there's a lot of drug sales that go on here, we don't like the look of these houses, they meet a criteria that --",
  "But they can't -- the difference here, Your Honor, is that they set out to target certain people, to test certain people in order to use arrest as leverage, not simply for medical purposes any more, and the criteria, the list of criteria is a discretionary list of criteria that's now being applied in the context of a police search, which is what made Delaware v. Prouse an improper program.",
  "Mm-hmm.",
  "Without their consent?",
  "If they were testing people --",
  "If they were testing people for medical purposes and they had consent to medical care, then there's not a problem.",
  "Right.",
  "It's not -- it is a problem, Your Honor, if the purpose of the search --",
  "Yes, I'm sorry.",
  "If it's medical treatment, yes. Yes.",
  "If it's medical treatment --",
  "-- and there's consent to do that, yes.",
  "At that point he has probable cause or individualized suspicion.",
  "Uh-huh.",
  "What's different here is that the search was conducted without probable cause.",
  "What s happened --",
  "What happened that's different is that different people are tested, because we have discretionary criteria that are being applied in a law enforcement setting, so we have --",
  "He instructed the jury, Your Honor, that there was a dual purpose to the test, that as soon as there was also a law enforcement search, then the field changed, the search changed, and the Fourth Amendment applied.",
  "In the context of jury instructions, where he then said these were conducted for both purposes, Your Honor, yes.",
  "I don't believe there was a request for a finding, but there certainly was medical testimony on that fact, Your Honor, from Ira Chasnoff, from Dr. Chasnoff.",
  "That's right, Your Honor.",
  "The jury verdict --",
  "Okay.",
  "Okay.",
  "Mm-hmm.",
  "That is my position, Your Honor, and I didn't mean to change from that. All I meant to do was clarify why I thought it was okay, and not a Fourth Amendment violation, to then turn it over once you have some evidence and you can meet the standards of the Fourth Amendment. But it s a different --",
  "The original call that went, Your Honor, was from the hospital to the police, but then it was a very preliminary inquiry, and a task force was formed consisting of members of all the departments, and the task force was actually chaired by law enforcement, by the Chief of Police and by the Solicitor, and the policy as first written was written by law enforcement, by the police.",
  "The question --",
  "No. The --",
  "The question -- that's right, Your Honor. The question originally came from the hospital to the police, but the answer, the answer of how to cope with this came from the police, and they wrote the policy, and they taught the hospital how to maintain the chain of evidence at the beginning of the search for people who fell within a list of discretionary criteria, and they enforced this policy at this one hospital and not at any other hospital.",
  "I'm sorry, Your Honor.",
  "No, Your Honor, there was not.",
  "No, Your Honor, there was not.",
  "I think that's true, Your Honor, but the purpose of the warrant requirement -- at least for the people who tested positive and they then were reported, but for the people who didn't test positive and who were searched, we don't know who those people were, there was certainly a constitutional violation there, because they were being searched for -- no, I'm sorry, Your Honor, I'm wrong.",
  "Because they weren't being searched for law enforcement purposes.",
  "You're right.",
  "It's the agreement, and --",
  "And it's a list of discretionary criteria being applied by police officers. It's the difference between Delaware v. Prouse and Sitz.",
  "Well, there's no finding on that from the district court, and the only testimony shows that it's a list of discretionary criteria that is not liable to really find people who use cocaine --",
  "I think the difference is, Your Honor, that the --",
  "Yes.",
  "I think it's not quite my argument, because the issue I think is that the discretion when it's used by a doctor for medical purposes -- doctors have discretion and that may be appropriate in the context of medicine, but once discretion is used by police officers for a law enforcement purpose, the world changes.",
  "Absolutely, Your Honor.",
  "Absolutely, Your Honor.",
  "I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor. Three brief points, Your Honor. What distinguishes this policy from a medical protocol is that it was designed by and for law enforcement, and implemented by the hospital for the purposes of crime detection. To say that the medical criteria was medically appropriate, as I said, is different from saying that it establishes probable cause or individualized suspicion, or allows the hospital officials therefore to search, as agents of the police, under a police policy that incorporates criminal sanctions for evidence of a crime, and to turn that right over to the police. And if it was probable cause, if they had probable cause here, why not obtain a warrant? Why not test your criteria with an objective magistrate to ensure that you're not the discretion that's allowed in those criteria is not being abused. That's the purpose of the warrant requirement, is to protect against that kind of abusive discretion, and that's exactly the discretion we see that was used in this policy, where women who met the criteria were not tested, and women who didn't meet the criteria, perhaps, in some cases were. We don't know. We do know that some who met the criteria weren't tested. In terms of the finding of fact, in the title VI opinion the court, in addressing the policy as a whole, talks about the goal of the policy, the ultimate goal of the policy, but when he's looking, when the trial judge looked at the purpose of the search, he recognized the dual nature of that searched -- search, that there was a medical purpose and a law enforcement purpose, and that's what brought this search under the Fourth Amendment, and that's what makes this policy so insidious. What happened here is that the doctors used the promise of confidentiality in the private physician-patient relationship to obtain information from their patients in order to turn it over to the police. That's all they did here, and when they did that, when they took on the mantle of the police, they had to obtain a warrant based on probable cause, and they had to do that for all the reasons this Court enunciated in the special needs doctrine, when it limits that doctrine so that discretion will not invade police actions, so that Delaware v. Prouse is not okay, Sitz is, because of that discretion. And that's why, even if this Court were to apply the balancing test here, we've got a case that's got discretionary criteria, we have a significant intrusion on the body, not a minimal intrusion like we had in Sitz, and we have no diminished expectation of privacy. In fact, we have a heightened expectation of privacy in our doctor-patient relationship, and as the amici point out much better than I could, that's what's at stake in this case. So we ask this Court --",
  "Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice. May it please the Court. I think my first task here is to show you that what the Texas Court did was contrary to or an unreasonable application of your previous decision in Penry in this case, and I believe that your decision in Penry or Penry One as we call it in our brief was fairly clear in saying that as to this man, a retarded man like this with a life long history of really gruesome child abuse where virtually his whole case is based on the retardation and the horrible child abuse, that the three questions of the old Texas statutory scheme just don't work or at least they do not work unless you take the first question which asks whether the defendant acted deliberately and give \"deliberately\" a definition. It would have to be a rather unusual definition of deliberately that will tell the jury, contrary to the normal meaning of the word, that you can find that conduct resulting from child -- from retardation maybe even from child abuse, although that's perhaps a stretch, could be a basis for a finding that the defendant did not act deliberately. When you summarized in Grand v Collins the Penry holding, you said and I'm quoting from page 474 of 506 US Reports, you said that \"in Penry it was impossible to give mitigating effect to Penry's evidence by way of answering the special issues. Grand says that without any qualification. I would assume that one qualification is appropriate because Penry does indicate that there is -- that the definition of deliberately was a possibility for --",
  "I think that's clear, Your Honor, indeed I said it and I thought I was being clear when I said it.",
  "But I -- but I was not a judge, Your Honor, and there is no one of whom a jury is likely to be more skeptical in a situation like that than defense counsel. I beg to differ with the suggestion that the judge made it clear, and I think it's the instruction that the judge gives that has to be clear for starters. I don't think you -- I don't think you can rely on defense counsel or on the jury's acceptance of defense counsel's interpretation. The instruction is at page --",
  "I respectfully submit that's much less than clear, Your Honor, and becomes even less clear if you read the preceding sentence. The preceding sentence says \"if you find that there are any mitigating circumstances in this case you must decide how much weight they deserve, if any, and therefore give effect and consideration to them in assessing defendant's personal culpability at the time you answer the special issue.\"",
  "I can only respectfully beg to differ, Your Honor, and in doing so I'll -- let me stress a couple of phrases. Give effect and consideration to the mitigating circumstances at the time you answer the special issue. I respectfully submit to you that that is impossible. That is as if I said to this court would you please give effect and consideration to Estelle v. Smith at the time you resolve the Penry issue in this case. If I said that I think I would get nothing but blank looks because I think that is a meaningless statement, but it's identical.",
  "No, it wasn't.",
  "That was a voir dire, that wasn't me actually Your Honor that was a voir dire back in March.",
  "Done by Joe Price, who's a very able man but he was doing it back in March and the jury didn't deliberate until July. I know of no case where the court has held that an improper instruction or even an ambiguous instruction was clarified by voir dire questions asked four months previously or by voir dire questions. I don't think that works. The prosecutor did not, neither Mr. Price nor his colleague, they did not say in their closing argument, they did not reinforce what I had said to the jury. They did not differ from it, they did not reinforce it. They chose to remain silent and get whatever benefit they could get out of what I think is an extraordinarily confusing situation. To me the important fact was not the -- not defense counsel's argument, but the jury one might expect would pay somewhat more attention to the piece of paper that they were handed to write their verdict on from the court which was identical 100 percent verbatim identical with the piece of paper they were handed in Penry One and which said in it as part of the instructions as -- or actually as part of the verdict form, there's nothing about mitigating evidence on that piece of paper but there is something that says if you want to answer no, it has to be because there's a reasonable doubt as to I believe it's the facts pertaining or the evidence pertaining to the special issue. In other words they had to find that there was reasonable doubt as to whether the state had proved --",
  "You certainly do and I believe it's at 676 of the joint appendix. If that's not it, it's close. Yes, that's where it is. The question is to -- to vote no to any question the foreperson had to sign a statement that said \"We the jury because at least ten jurors have a reasonable doubt as to the matter inquired about in this special issue find and determine that the answer to this special issue is no. The matter inquired about in this special issue had nothing to do with mitigating evidence. They were supposed to understand from what I submit with all due respect, Justice Scalia, is a very obscure instruction however lucidly explained by a defense lawyer who they did not have to trust that a -- they had to understand that those words that I just read did not mean what they said, and I think that that is not reasonable to ask of a jury.",
  "Well, what is -- a number of things I think are confusing about it including the extraordinary fact that it doesn't give them any hint which one to pick, but the words I would focus on are most strongly -",
  "I submit it would have been significantly less confusing if they had indeed put a fourth question on the piece of paper Your Honor, but I also want to call your attention in the instruction to the words \"as reflected by a negative finding to the issue under consideration\". I suggest to you that those words, if they have any meaning at all, if the possible defense of them is if they have no meaning at all, that's the best that can be said for them, but if they have a meaning they mean that you cannot give effect to the mitigating evidence unless you can reflect it to -- I mean a negative finding to the issue under consideration, whatever that is.",
  "There was no fourth question.",
  "I figure it was not so clear especially if they do not necessarily take defense counsel's word unsupported by the prosecutor --",
  "I don't think he had authority. I think you'd already done that for him Your Honor?",
  "I think it's fair to characterize what you did in Penry and Penry One, Justice Scalia, as holding the Texas statute unconstitutional as applied to Penry and when the statute is held unconstitutional of course the state court on retrial need not observe it. There was the escape hatch that was one of giving a definition of the word deliberately. I have no idea, I cannot imagine why the trial court did not do that or why the prosecution did not suggest that they do that, but they didn't. That -- I admit that that's not without its difficulties but the suggestion --",
  "Yes we did, Your Honor. We actually asked for two definitions of deliberately. There's one that's in the appendix the joint appendix and I think I realize in going over it I think maybe the better one is the one that's not in the joint appendix. There are two definitions of deliberately; request for instruction number 11 which is not in the appendix but it's in volume three of the record at 107172 is an attempt, and it's moot whether it would have been successful, to use the jury instruction to cure the Penry problem. We also -- we also proposed several instructions that would -- well I think one that would have given a fourth question, one that would at least have said in plain English nullify, give a false answer, you don't have to tell the truth in response to these questions. I think if the judge had done that, I think he runs into problems under Roberts against Louisiana.",
  "It is true that Roberts was -- depended in part on the capriciousness, but the thrust of Roberts I think is that it's intolerable to tell the jury to disregard what they are being told to do.",
  "As I understand what the state was contending in Roberts is not that dissimilar from what the state is contending here. The state was saying sure we could give effect to mitigating evidence. We have all these proposed verdicts and we tell them that they can render a false one if they want to. That's exactly what the state's arguing. That's what they propose to do here.",
  "Well it -- in Roberts as I understand the argument that was rejected in Roberts, no one was -- no one was saying oh, there's no problem with the statute because the jury can do whatever it wants. They were saying yes we can give individualized consideration to individual offenders. We do it in this perhaps rather unusual way by having the jury give false answers. And the Court said that's not an acceptable way of doing it. That's my reading of Roberts.",
  "That's right. I don't think we got a nullification instruction. I'm not sure what position my adversaries are going to take. I've read their brief and I don't know what their position is on whether we got that instruction. The --",
  "Yes, and it is -- it is in the joint appendix and it is cited in my brief, I do not have the -- I can find it pretty quickly. I think I can. If not I will defer Your Honor's - it's in the third volume of the appendix. It is at page 669, and I would say Your Honor that -- if the question is whether that particular instruction would have cured the Penry error, I would have to answer no. That one would not have. I think the other one we proposed might or might not have. It's moot because we didn't get any of them. If the question is whether we proposed things that would have cured the Penry error, it's very clear the answer is yes. We did it this way, we did it the other way, we did it -- there are plenty of proposed instructions that we think could have complied with Penry. The court gave none of them.",
  "No, no, was it on paper? It certainly had not been enacted and as far as I know did not exist, Your Honor?",
  "Under the new statute, yes.",
  "I think so, Your Honor. I am not above trying to think of a way to --",
  "I don't think I have -- I don't think I --",
  "Yes, yes and I would -- while I might not give it up, I would have a tough time saying that Penry was not complied with under the new Texas procedure.",
  "He did not say that. One can infer that's what he believed Your Honor. He did not say anything.",
  "I'm not aware of such a suggestion, Justice Kennedy. I do submit respectfully the answer to your previous question is clear enough although it's unfortunate when a judge is sitting with the United States Supreme Court saying one thing and the Texas legislature saying another. The Court wins. He has to follow what this Court says.",
  "I guess I would answer by saying if the Texas statute has been held unconstitutional as applied then it's perfectly appropriate for a Texas judge not to implement it. I see nothing wrong with that. Let me try to talk briefly about my second task, if I can, which is to show that the -- this Peebles psychiatric report was contrary to or an unreasonable application of this Court's decision in Estelle v Smith. Based on the briefs I think that issue is going to boil down to whether the Peebles report was the sort of rebuttal that is permitted under Buchanan against Kentucky. I think it is quite clear that it is not. The Peebles report which is at page 60 of the joint appendix served one function in this case for the prosecution and that was to introduce one sentence which says it is -- \"it is my further professional opinion that if Johnny Paul Penry were released from custody that he would be dangerous to other persons\". That is the heart of that -- that statement is summarizes perfectly what the state was trying to prove on its affirmative case of future dangerousness. On that issue the defendant produced no mental status evidence, no psychiatric evidence and there was no occasion for rebuttal. They didn't rebut anything we said. That is, no -- no court below by the way found that it was rebuttal. The theories of the courts below are so weak that as I read my adversary's briefs they do not defend the theories of the courts below. The state does and its allied amici do at some length argue harmless error. I do not see how you can think an error was harmless or the admission of a piece of evidence was harmless when you look at what the prosecution did with that piece of evidence, and that is at page 7 of our brief. This is the last page, the last paragraph of the prosecution's rebuttal summation. This is the climax, this is what he saved to have ringing in the jury's ears when they went out to deliberate. \"He was examined by Doctor Felix Peebles who found that he was sane. He knew the difference between right and wrong and he was competent to stand trial.\" But Doctor Peebles went on and made an additional finding that was really out of the ordinary and I have never seen this in any kind of a report. I'm quoting the prosecutor, closing out. He just added it, he said that \"it is my further professional opinion that if Johnny Paul Penry were released from custody that he would be dangerous to other persons\". The question of course comes why -- why did the state love that report so much? They say and they're right the dangerousness was not a tough issue for them, but I think the Curt must remember that the jury wasn't just answering yes or no to the second issue. Under your decision in Penry the jury had to take into account had to weigh the mitigating evidence against the perfectly horrible and very real evidence of man's dangerousness. And I submit to you that it was a very tough and very close case because the --",
  "It was a close case on how you come out at the end when you consider that there's a ton of mitigating evidence and also very serious evidence of dangerousness.",
  "It doesn't have to Your Honor, I do not -- I can only refer Your Honor to the record on this. The record of the mental retardation and the child abuse is as appalling as you could want. If you browse through about pages 139 to 219 of the record which is the testimony on the child abuse, it is the most painful reading you'll ever -- you'll ever have in your life. This was first of all it's a retarded man but it's a retarded child whose mother beat him physically, abused him verbally, humiliated him in the most revolting ways.",
  "Yes.",
  "I beg to differ. Of course it would not affect the jury's determination of how culpable he was but the jury had the power to decide I don't care how much abuse he had and how much retardation he had. I don't feel safe with this man still alive. They had the power to make that decision. That's the decision the prosecutor was asking them to make. That's why dangerousness was the prosecutor's big point and the Peebles report was the prosecutor's big exhibit. If you read the prosecutor's summation he clearly thought --",
  "There was indeed but this was the one he liked best.",
  "I think it does, Your Honor, because I do think it was important not just whether the jury thought he was dangerousness -- dangerous but whether -- but how disturbed the jury was by the dangerousness. I think the degree of dangerousness and the impact it had was terribly important at the trial.",
  "One -- one sentence which - it is a sentence which as the prosecutor points out appears to have been stuck in there by this professional, this uncross-examined professional with no axe to grind who from reading the report you would think he took one look at the man and said this man is so dangerous I've got to volunteer it to the court. I don't know if that's what really happened but that's what the prosecutor suggested to the jury.",
  "I'm not saying it can't be looked at but I think to decide whether it's harmless you have to say how different is the case without it, different enough that the prosecutor would not have had this key point.",
  "Well we think it was Your Honor. I think the argument the main argument against that it wasn't Estelle error is Buchanan against Kentucky and I've tried to show this certainly wasn't rebuttal, they weren't rebutting anything. There are other theories and I think they're very very very tenuous indeed it's not even clear from my adversary's briefs that they believe. If I may, I'll reserve the balance of my time.",
  "Thank you. Let me -- I'm going to try to use that time just to try to convey some information on some points that may be of interest. On the question of what a Texas court could have done my Texas colleague advises me that there was a case called McPherson in which a Texas court before the statute was amended did give a fourth special issue and that that was ultimately upheld by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. That had not occurred at the time of our trial but the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals did approve it. There was an escape hatch available and it was used. I do not have the citation to the McPherson case here; if there's an appropriate way to provide it we'll certainly do that. Secondly on the question of -- I learned to say voir dire when I was in Texas and I'm trying to unlearn it, but it's one or the other voir dire or voir dire. I suggest that it is perilous to rely on voir dire of all things to undo or to cure a problem with an instruction. Mr. Taylor is quite right, that this process in Texas goes on for weeks and weeks and a lot of things get said. If you'll look at volume 22 page 1792 of the record, you will see one of the jurors, one of the jurors who actually sat being instructed by the prosecutors, you should not automatically answer these questions a certain way to achieve a punishment, you should not answer one of them no because I want him to get a life sentence. Possibly technically correct but surely in the context of what these jurors were supposed to do, likely to confuse, my point simply a lot of things get said in voir dire over a long time and it would be a mistake to say that that cured what I think is a hopelessly confusing instruction. On the Peebles Report where Mr. Taylor made the argument that what they were really trying to show was that Penry was a psychopath, I have a very short response. The Peebles Report doesn't say that. There's nothing in the Peebles Report that says he's a psychopath. Sure they said it; everybody else said it. Peebles said pretty much what our expert said, he said he has mental retardation and anti-social conduct, but anti-social personality disorder, you won't find that in the Peebles Report. Unless there are further questions I'll submit.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The complaint that Ameritech filed in this case in Federal court specifically alleged not only that the ICC had misinterpreted the interconnection agreements at issue, but also that its order requiring payment of reciprocal compensation for a particular category of calls violated several specific sections of the Telecommunications Act as well as several allegedly applicable FCC rulings. For that reason, our position, and I'm arguing today for WorldCom and several other companies who had signed interconnection agreements with Ameritech and also were sued as codefendants along with the ICC, our position is that the complaint stated straightforward preemption claims alleging ongoing violations of Federal law by State officials and therefore those claims were within Federal jurisdiction and also actionable notwithstanding the Eleventh Amendment. Where we differ with Ameritech and actually with the final respondent AT&T is on the question that was being discussed earlier, which is the scope of valid Federal claims in enforcement cases, and specifically whether a claim of mere misinterpretation of an interconnection agreement raises any Federal issue or not. Our position is that in most cases, at least, a claim of misinterpretation of an interconnection agreement would raise claims only under State common law contracts and therefore has to be treated as a State law claim, but in terms of this case, since the contract -- the complaint did allege violations of the statute and FCC rulings, there certainly was jurisdiction, we believe. Now, let me turn first to the jurisdiction issue, and then I want to get to --",
  "Yes, sir.",
  "Certainly it ought to be done by virtue of some analysis of the intent of the parties, if it's a negotiated agreement. There also are agreements which are imposed through arbitration, and then the commission is essentially analyzing its own intent in imposing --",
  "Well, Congress, Your Honor, very specifically turns over responsibility for developing these contracts, reviewing them, to State commissions, and in the process of doing that says that while the State commissions have to follow various substantive standards in 251, they also are authorized in more than one place in the act to impose their own policies that are not inconsistent with the Federal policies, and it also said the parties can negotiate agreements notwithstanding the substantive provisions of the act, and that the State commission can't overturn them unless they find that they violate the public interest and necessity. So what you have here is a very clear recognition by Congress that they want these to be real contracts, not merely orders applying Federal standards, and that there will be lots of issues which under this Court's ruling should be viewed as State law contract issues that will come up in the enforcement proceedings, so we don't see any basis under Jackson Transit and this Court's other cases dealing with the development of Federal common law for saying that the contract interpretation rules, the rules for determining how the contract ought to be read, ought to be elaborated as a matter of Federal common law in the Federal courts rather than through analysis of State common law which already exists. Now, these cases will be sometimes in Federal court and sometimes in State court, because there will be some times when there are Federal claims that are brought that can sustain a motion to dismiss. I don't happen to think these claims would have sustained a motion to dismiss, but --",
  "I see that as a Federal question, Your Honor. I don't think there's any question about that. That is essentially what Ameritech claimed here. The district court and the court of appeals, of course, rejected that on the merits, but their claim was that this interpretation was barred by the FCC's interpretation of the act.",
  "Their claim was that even if that is what the parties intended, that Federal law had evolved to the point where that was preempted by Congress, or by the FCC.",
  "I'm not sure I really meant to say that every case becomes a Federal case. I think there are lots of situations in which the interpretation as done by the commission is then a matter -- whether that's correct or not is a State law issue. What I meant to answer in response to your question was then, if a party says that interpretation of what the parties really intended has somehow brought the contract into some inconsistency with applicable FCC regulations, that's a Federal claim. At the same time, if the commission says, we think they probably intended this, but we're not going to do that because we think Federal law requires us to do Y instead of X, that also raises a Federal question.",
  "But if they're merely looking at the intent, there will be lots of situations where there isn't any Federal preemption because the law, after all, says if you negotiate it, the substantive provisions of 251 don't apply. In most of those situations, you're going to have State law contract issues which will be then analyzed by the State commission and, absent some additional Federal issue that comes along, the place where that would be appealed would be the State court, in my understanding.",
  "Unless there was some odd situation involving diversity, my sense is -- my understanding is --",
  "Our position, Your Honor, is that under Jackson Transit, that the fact that the Federal statute requires that a contract exists but doesn't specify the terms of the contract, in that situation the contract itself remains a matter of State law.",
  "Well, actually, as to negotiated contracts, the Federal standards --",
  "-- are very, very loose.",
  "It has to either be discriminatory or a violation of public interest, which is -- and the specific rules of 251 don't apply.",
  "I would view that as something that is authorizing the State commission to --",
  "-- to apply its -- no, obviously, they can look at Federal policies if they want to, but I wouldn't suggest that it's inherently Federal in the way that the Solicitor General does. Now, there are other situations that could come up. A contract could expressly incorporate Federal law, and that might or might not create a Federal claim. This Court has wrestled for 100 years with the issue of when Federal law incorporated into State law causes of action do or don't create Federal question jurisdiction. In other situations, the State commission might have imposed the terms of the contract in an area where the parties didn't agree, and in that situation, if they are imposing it by virtue of their interpretation of the Federal regulations, and then that particular clause is later interpreted in some way that deviates from the Federal regulations, that might well be a Federal claim as well.",
  "Well, there have been assertions, Your Honor, that that's the case. My reading of these contracts is that they make -- that they -- and certainly in this case, the Illinois case, it specifically gives a definition of when reciprocal compensation will be paid, and both the commission and the two lower courts all said that this is not a case where there has been an incorporation of Federal regulations. This is a case where we can divine the actual intent of the parties, that these calls should be treated as calls where this compensation would be paid. And so what they said was, this is not an incorporation case, and I believe the contract in the Verizon case, to come next, is the same, that there was an intent at the time that was -- that the State commissions have said we're going to hold you to -- even though Federal law may have moved on, every time it moves on they say, if you agreed to something else, you're still stuck with it, and that's what the courts in both of these cases have said as well as the commissions. Maybe if I could turn, then, to the Eleventh Amendment issues, it is certainly our view that the five circuits that have said these cases present straightforward Ex parte Young cases, those circuits are correct, because they do involve, in situations where there is a Federal claim being asserted against an action of a State commission, either an enforcement case or an approval case, a claim seeking an order bringing the State commission into compliance with Federal law, and it is, I think, an ongoing violation of Federal law, because when they approve and enforce an interconnection agreement, or they enforce it in some way, interpret it in some way, they are then telling the parties that they have to live by that interpretation during the term of the agreement.",
  "It's our position that they are a necessary party, but to use the technical term under the Federal rules, if there was a reason why they can't be sued and that the case can't go forward, then they may not be an indispensable party. The distinction is drawn in Rule 19 between those two. Certainly, they've --",
  "That's true, Your Honor, but what makes them a necessary party is that the private parties have an interest in having the administrative body that has told them to do X be bound by a ruling from the Federal court which they're trying to get which says don't do X, do Y, and that --",
  "And the reason why a Federal district court is not named as a defendant in the court of appeals is because the court of appeals has the power in a unitary system to direct the district court to do something. When a Federal court, though, is --",
  "Right, but I think --",
  "It may be factually true that most of the time State commissions will obey Federal courts, but 100 years of jurisprudence under Ex parte Young and before all follow the Federal administrative model and say that as to Federal -- State executive officials, when they violate Federal law, that you name them as a defendant.",
  "Well, Your Honor, though, the -- a large number of these Ex parte Young cases, going back to the Reagan v. Farmer's Loan case that Ms. McDowell mentioned, an Ex parte Young, cases involving rate-making commissions, railroad commissions and others that are -- have always been named as the defendants. In their official capacity the individuals are named, and that Reagan case in 1894 said that's not an Eleventh Amendment problem. You're not really suing the State, you're suing them to bring them into compliance with the Federal statute. Ex parte Young, the defendants included not just the Attorney General but also the rate-making commissioners, and that is just the way it's done, and I don't think it has any, as you have suggested, any great intrusion on the sovereign interests of the State to have them named. In fact, that's the essence of Ex parte Young, that it's not an intrusion on their interests to have them brought into compliance under the Supremacy Clause, and it would be, I think, an odd rule to say, well, we're going to start having review of State actions, or some category of State actions in Federal court for compliance with Federal law where we don't name the defendants as -- the State as -- State individuals as defendants.",
  "Now, there's been a number of other arguments raised against the application of Ex parte Young here. I don't think any of them is very substantial. There's a notion that somehow there's an elaborate remedial scheme here comparable to the one in Seminole Tribe, but in fact there isn't any elaborate remedial scheme in the statute. It just says you can sue State commissions in Federal court, or to the extent we're relying on 1331, there's no scheme at all. We also have an -- the invocation of the Larson case which was discussed by this Court in detail in Pennhurst. Larson, I believe, is the case that you apply in a situation where you don't have Supremacy Clause considerations at stake. Essentially, what the Court said in Pennhurst is, when the Supremacy Clause is at issue, we basically allow lawsuits to proceed against all prospective ongoing violations of Federal law by State officials, but Larson provides a test that says where you're suing without Supremacy Clause considerations to enforce State law against State officials or Federal law against Federal officials, in that situation you try to differentiate between mere violations of Federal law and violations that are so serious that we won't treat the State official or the Federal official as an agent of the State any more. That is not the test that ought to be applied under Ex parte Young, and certainly has not been applied in the past. We also have the Fourth Circuit's analysis in which it undertook an entire sort of ad hoc balancing test trying to weigh State interests against Federal interests. I think this Court is clearly on record as saying that in the Ex parte Young context we're not going to get into that kind of balancing test. The balancing test of the Fourth Circuit I thought was particularly unfortunate, because basically what that Court did is, it looked at the merits of the case and said, well, we don't think that the Federal claims are very strong here, so therefore we're going to say there's no ability to sue the State under Ex parte Young, and that doesn't seem like a very helpful way to go about -- thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Children's Internet Protection Act is unconstitutional for two separate reasons. First, the act does require libraries accepting Federal funds to engage in conduct that is itself at least presumptively unconstitutional. Strict scrutiny does apply, we say, because the --",
  "This Court's whole series of cases involving the public forum doctrine, Your Honor, which I noticed was -- was not really mentioned by my colleague, Mr. Olson. The Internet, when it comes into the library, is -- all of the information available on the Internet, as diverse as human thought -- immediately available to the patron. It is the most pure form of public forum that you can possibly imagine.",
  "Well, Your Honor, the whole question about whether the library could do it this way depends on how you view the public forum doctrine. And the -- what the Court has said again and again is in deciding whether something is or is not a public forum, you look at whether the access is selective or general. That -- that's what the terminology was in the Court's case --",
  "No. No, Your Honor.",
  "Applying the Court's general holdings in -- in a whole series of cases to try to decide whether this is a public forum, a designated public forum, created --",
  "The Internet terminals in the library are a designated public forum, Your Honor.",
  "Certainly not. We do not say that strict scrutiny applies to the decisions that the library makes about which book to buy because when the library buys books, it chooses books one by one. It engages in selective access as opposed to general access. With the Internet, on the other hand, the entire world of -- of content that is on the Internet is there available to the patrons. It has not been selected --",
  "-- by the library in any way.",
  "That -- that -- with respect, Justice Scalia, the way the public forum doctrine works in our judgment -- and we're basing this as -- as close as we can on this Court's cases -- is that the one thing that Government can't do is allow all content under the sun, not even knowing what content is there, and then exclude, cull out one area of disfavored content. If -- if you say that that exclusion, that -- that pointing at that one particular area of content and excluding it, is the same as not making it a public forum, then -- then the public forum doctrine no longer has any meaning.",
  "The -- the case of a public school library is a -- is a more difficult case.",
  "I think, Your Honor, I can't give you a yes or no answer.",
  "I would have to know how the policies are of the school --",
  "Then I -- then I do say it's a public forum, Your Honor. If they allow students --",
  "Yes.",
  "Certainly not, Your Honor.",
  "Certainly not.",
  "First of all, all that holding that it's a public forum does is -- is give you the level of scrutiny that applies to the rule. Then you have to look at the rule, apply the usual standards of narrow tailoring, less restrictive alternatives, compelling interests --",
  "But I think the Constitution analysis may well come out differently with respect to young children, Your Honor.",
  "Well --",
  "Your Honor, I think that -- that, first of all, classrooms are different from libraries even in the school context because a school classroom -- library -- a computer is obviously not used for independent research. If the -- in the library situation in the school, you would have different age groups. You'd have different considerations. You'd have different policies. There's a lot of different things that could be distinguished from this case. And I think it -- it's important --",
  "It -- it may well be, Your Honor, depending on the age group, depending on the circumstances, depending on the way the -- the library is used by the students.",
  "Well, Your Honor --",
  "Denver Area has a substantial bearing and I think it's one of the strongest cases supporting our position. It is true that the Court did not go -- it -- the -- the plurality opinion in -- in the case did not go so far as to say we're going to apply a public forum analysis and strict scrutiny, but -- but Justice Breyer's opinion went much -- very close to that and said we're going to apply very heightened scrutiny. We're going to look very carefully at this. And this was a law that is in many ways closely analogous to what's going on here. It was a law that said, we have a public access station. Anybody from the outside world can come in and put whatever programming they want on that station, but we're going to exclude indecency, just that one area of content, because we don't think that belongs in the home.",
  "Well, Your Honor --",
  "Well, Your Honor, the -- the way the disabling provision is set up, first of all, is it's designed to give the library some job to determine whether your purpose is bona fide or not. It says bona fide research or other lawful purpose. So the first problem is you go to the librarian's supervisor who has the authority under the statute to turn off the filter and you have to explain to them what your purpose is to look at the --",
  "Well, the -- the statute on the face of it says the library is required to inquire into your purpose and make a decision about whether it is a bona fide research purpose or other lawful purpose for looking at the material which has been filtered out by the -- by the filter. So you have a discretion problem of severe proportions, I submit. Plus, you have a stigma problem, very much like the one --",
  "They will presumably have to have some information about what sites you're interested in looking at in order to determine whether that would be lawful or not. So they will then have to inquire into, well, what's -- what is it you need to get that's being blocked? Why are you looking at it? Is it lawful?",
  "Well, clearly the library is responsible for determining whether or not you fall within the exception. Even if -- even if they're empowered under the statute -- and I think this is unclear -- just to accept your representation without any further explanation, you still have the problem that you're going up to the -- to the librarian and saying please turn off the smut filter. I need to get access to some material. So that -- that you're being required to do that. There's a stigma problem very much like --",
  "There's a third problem, which is you have -- a lot of times this will only come up in the middle of your research session. You won't know that you're going to be blocked getting access to the Republican National Committee site or to the site for some orphanage that is trying to raise money. There's -- since the -- many of the blocks are so irrational, you can't anticipate it. So you'll have to stop your session and go talk to a librarian about getting this thing turned off or getting this site unblocked. Somebody will then have to look at the site --",
  "But certainly, Your Honor. But -- but our submission is that you shouldn't just willy-nilly compare the Internet in the public library to books and how they're handled by libraries because the Internet is a public forum. It is all of this content that has not been prescreened or preselected by the Government which they are making available to you --",
  "Well, perhaps --",
  "Indeed, Your Honor. And -- and the Court has repeatedly cautioned that when you're making a decision about whether something is a public forum, you have to look at the particular medium of communication that is at issue, not the broader context. So, for example, when the Court in Cornelius was looking at the Combined Federal Campaign and trying to decide whether that was a public forum, the Government said, well, it's the Federal work force. The Federal work force is not a public forum. But the Court said, no, we have to look and see what kinds of people have been given access to the Combined Federal Campaign and allowed to solicit funding from the Federal -- the Federal workers and has it been done on a selective basis or a general basis. Because it was selective, the Court ultimately determined that it's not a public forum. It may well be that --",
  "Well, Your Honor, if you allow the Government to define its forum as all content under sun -- under the sun ever invented by mankind except the piece that they don't like, then I submit that -- that will be the end of the public forum doctrine because there will never be any situation in which the Government will be constrained in any way to censor out a particular piece of content that it -- from the public forum.",
  "Yes, Your Honor.",
  "Right, but I'm -- we're here in the context of designated public forums. And if you allow content --",
  "If -- if you allow the content --",
  "-- to be defined as everything but, that's okay. Then there -- there is no doctrine.",
  "Well, and it -- and then it has to make another decision. Is it going to just turn the Internet on or is it going to do what it could do, which is to say we are going to treat websites like we treat books. We're going to look at them one by one and decide whether they should be available, whether they meet our collection development policies.",
  "I appreciate that, Your Honor.",
  "No, no, no. It would be -- it would trigger strict scrutiny for a library to do exactly what the statute requires. That's our submission, which is to say if they allow the whole Internet in except this one piece of content under the public forum doctrine -- or perhaps the Court wants to apply the kind of public forum doctrine light of the whole question of whether --",
  "Yes, sir.",
  "Our position is that that would trigger strict scrutiny that they would then have to satisfy and --",
  "Excuse me? Well, in -- in most, if not all, cases it would come out against it. It would be unconstitutional, clearly, because they're blocking a vast amount of speech that is not even sexually explicit. And so we have a narrow tailoring problem. And there are much more -- much more effective, less restrictive alternatives which we had all this evidence at trial about.",
  "Exactly, Your Honor.",
  "Yes. I'm trying to make sure I get the --",
  "I appreciate it, Your Honor.",
  "Clearly not, Your Honor.",
  "There's no -- there's no argument that we -- we'd make that that would be unconstitutional. They would then be letting them in as they would books, using their collection development policies, deciding what's valuable, and that would not be a violation.",
  "No, Your Honor.",
  "Absolutely not. If they're not letting everybody in, as -- as general access. They're exercising selective access.",
  "It's not a question of exclusion. It's a question of affirmative inclusion through selection --",
  "No, Your Honor. We don't acknowledge that excluding --",
  "-- excluding an area of content can take it out of the forum doctrine. Let me get to my second point, though, which -- which is --",
  "Oh, clearly, Your Honor. I don't think there are any -- any facts that it would be necessary for the Court that haven't been brought out in that -- that trial and that lengthy opinion. Now, our position with respect to point two is --",
  "It is that libraries --",
  "-- even -- even if the Internet is precisely analogous to books in the library context, that something about the library context lets librarians in the exercise of professional judgment that they ordinarily exercise, even in deciding to edit the Internet, that the Federal Government under the First Amendment has no business using the spending power to try to distort that medium and push librarians away from their professional judgment toward the most restrictive possible policy on information flow into the library setting. In other words, our second point is that a library is very much like a public university which this Court has several times indicated is a -- is a special sphere set off for the governmental promotion of private and free expression, that in that kind of a setting, the Federal Government should not use the spending power to impose a one-size-fits-all policy about --",
  "No, Your Honor. I'm citing only First Amendment cases. I believe it is a First Amendment concept that there are certain kinds of relationships or certain kinds of institutions in which the amount of speech that is being allowed is decided by the people who are designated as professionals to run that institution. For example --",
  "Yes, Your Honor. If it was done by statute. But -- but, for example, professors should set the curriculum at a public university. I don't think that the Congress can say to the universities of this country, we've given you money, you therefore have to cut your departments. If you -- if you take the money --",
  "I think it -- when you get to the people who run the -- run the university as their job, that's fine, yes, Your Honor.",
  "Certainly not, Your Honor.",
  "Well --",
  "-- first of all, let me address the book question. What this law is analogous to is, as applied to the book context, a law where the Government says we're going to help you buy books. Here's 10 percent of your book budget a year, and it doesn't just say you can't spend our money on books of a particular content. It says you can't have in your library books of a particular content. It starts to try to invade the professional judgments of librarians about what books would need to be to their patrons. And we have here a situation where 93 percent of the libraries have made a more liberal, more open policy decision than the one that the Congress favors, and they're now using the spending power to push them in --",
  "I think as long as it was viewpoint neutral, Your Honor, and otherwise a legitimate line, that would be not a problem. But -- but here --",
  "To the extent one could define that concept, I think that generally the Government -- the Court has said the Government can decide what -- what the money that it uses to subsidize the -- the local government with -- what it will be spent on, but it can't, I think, then expand the subsidy into attempting to regulate things like the other book decisions that the library might make.",
  "Of course not, Your Honor. Certainly the Government can say that you shouldn't make available materials to people that -- that -- for whom they have no constitutional right to see them, obscenity for adults --",
  "Well --",
  "If -- if I might, just in answer to that question, Your Honor, take a moment to describe what -- what it really is that the record shows about how these filters operate because I -- I think that that's really very helpful. What these -- these filters are, are lists of -- of sites that are banned for access in the -- in the setting where they're -- where they're in effect, and the -- the findings are that there's about 100,000 sexually explicit sites on the Internet at the time of trial. And so we can assume that some high percentage of that 100,000 are on the list, 90,000 perhaps, because there were some that they missed constantly. Now, in addition, the court found that the -- the very same list blocks at least tens of thousands of additional sites that are not sexually explicit at all or, if they have sexually explicit materials, are educational. They -- they teach people about gay sexuality or they teach them about safe sex techniques. And so we have -- on these lists is a proportion, a huge proportion, perhaps 25, perhaps 50 percent of the sites that are blocked that are not illegal even for children. Now, of the 90,000 or so that are blocked that are sexually explicit, there isn't a shred of evidence in this trial record that the Government attempted to put in about whether any of those are obscene. There was no showing of any kind that the filters ever actually find speech that is illegal for adults. And there's good reason to think that there isn't a lot of it on there because clearly illegal material is distributed in a different way than the -- than the way that would allow the filtering --",
  "Well --",
  "If I could -- if I could address that, Your Honor. The -- the court did say at least tens of thousands and they used the word pages at that point. But it's quite evident, if you look at the way they were reasoning from the evidence, that they meant sites. And the evidence is that there's about 11 million websites on the Internet, in -- in the accessible part of the Internet and that 100,000 of those are the sexually explicit ones and that the -- there are at least tens of thousands more that are on the list. So it's -- the Government also says in their brief that about one percent of the Internet is over- blocked, which would be about 100,000 sites. So it is a substantial percentage. It is also a substantial amount. And most importantly, it's a very large percentage of what they're blocking is not what they intend to block.",
  "No, that is not my answer.",
  "No. Our answer is --",
  "The way for it not to be a public forum is for them to decide affirmatively what they do want to include, not simply to say we'll take the -- the content of 400 million people contributing to the Internet, but we'll carve out one thing. If you allow that, then there is no designated public forum doctrine, and the Court has repeatedly said the distinction between a public forum and not is whether or not there's been selective access, which -- by which it means case by case --",
  "Maybe chat rooms are okay because the question is whether that's a content-based exclusion. But clearly, here you have a content-based exclusion.",
  "And it --",
  "The fact that they may -- may or may not think they have a good reason for doing it can't factor into the analysis, Your Honor. The way the -- the public forum doctrine works is you look at whether or not they -- they have allowed access generally or not, and if they have allowed access generally and then they say, but we don't want this, then that's a violation or at least it triggers strict scrutiny.",
  "Yes, because it lets in everything in the world. Every commercial site, every catalog, everybody's personal website, and a million other things I can't even conjure up are all being allowed in and provided to people in that setting. And then they're saying, except you can't have this. Now, if that's permitted under the forum doctrine, how can Southeastern Promotions be right where they said you can have any -- any play except Hair? We don't like Hair.",
  "And you have to deal with exactly the -- the discretion of -- of the librarian and about whether or not he or she is going to allow you -- allow it. You have to deal with the stigma, and you have to take the time out from your research session to go do that if it turns out in the middle of your research session that -- that some site that you need to go to. And you have to decide to do it not seeing the site because you can't see it to know whether it's valuable to you. So when you're surfing the Internet, the vastly more likely outcome will be that anything that's blocked people will just bypass and go on to something else.",
  "Well, it's not clear that the librarian would say yes. The librarian certainly doesn't have to say yes.",
  "It seems he's on a horn -- the horns of a dilemma. Either that is something that has got a lot of stigma to it that very few people are going to do, so it has the -- the effect of suppressing speech, or everybody --",
  "That is my position.",
  "Yes.",
  "Sure. You've got to go up and say please turn off the porn filter, Your Honor.",
  "Well, that's what it is.",
  "Well, if it turns out that people wouldn't be stigmatized by that -- and I think the court below was correct to conclude that they will be -- then -- then there's the second problem, which is what -- what is the purpose that you've accomplished by requiring people to go through this meaningless exercise other than to deter them. That is apparently then the only purpose of it and --",
  "You can do that in many different ways, Your Honor, that don't require anybody to approach anybody. You simply have a -- a card that they put in the computer that shows their age, and then it gives them whatever access the library decides is appropriate or whatever the parents may have decided is appropriate for the children. There are many less restrictive alternatives including use of the filtering technology as an option, at the parents' option for different ages that -- that can be considered and which were explored in depth by the district court, which I must say looked at this issue very carefully, was very sympathetic to the problems that arise with the -- with the sexually explicit content. It said the one thing we can't do is have one across-the-board answer even in one library, especially nationally, to have Congress which has no knowledge at all about what conditions may prevail in any given library, saying, well, we're going to push you, through the budgetary process, toward our position even though 93 percent of the librarians have found a much more suitable set of solutions in less restrictive, somewhat more subtle, more mixed policies than the one that Congress decided in its wisdom it should try to force on the library community using the spending power.",
  "Only to public libraries, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. The State of Texas in this case claims the right to criminally punish any unmarried adult couple for engaging in any form of consensual sexual intimacy that the State happens to disapprove of. It further claims that there's no constitutional problem raised by a criminal statute that is directed not just at conduct, but at a particular group of people, a law that criminalizes forms of sexual intimacy only for same-sex couples and not for anyone else in the State who has -- has the right to make a free choice to engage in the identical conduct. Petitioners are two adults who were arrested in a private home and criminally convicted simply because they engaged in one of the forms of sexual intimacy that is on the banned list in the State of Texas for same-sex couples. They bring two constitutional claims to the Court today. First, among the fundamental rights that are implicit in our concept of order of liberty, must be the right of all adult couples, whether same-sex or not, to be free from unwarranted State intrusion into their personal decisions about their preferred forms of sexual expression. Second, there's no legitimate and rational justification under the Equal Protection Clause for a law that regulates forms of sexual intimacy that are permitted in the State only for same-sex couples, thereby creating a kind of a second class citizenship to that group of people.",
  "The Court's cases, Mr. Chief Justice, say that history is a starting point, not the end point of the analysis. And I think that it's important to look at history as a whole and one of the errors that I think that the Court made in Bowers v. Hardwick was only looking at the issue in terms of homosexual sodomy and not looking at the issue in general terms, which is the right of everyone to decide for themselves about consensual private sexual intimacy. If you look at the history as a whole, you find a much more complicated picture. First of all, you find that sodomy was regulated going back to the founding for everyone and indeed the laws in the 19th century didn't focus on same-sex couples, they focused on particular --",
  "Well, Your Honor --",
  "I think it does come into it, because if you're going to suggest that the state of the law on the books in the 19th century is the touchstone you have to take into account that in the 19th century at least on the face of the law married couples were regulated in terms of their forms of sexual intimacy that were created for them.",
  "Indeed, they all were, Your Honor.",
  "I guess I'm suggesting Mr. -- Justice Scalia, that it's been conceded here by this State, it was conceded by the State of Georgia 17 years ago, that married couples can't be regulated as a matter of substantive due process in their personal sexual expression in the home. That means that the state of the law on the books in the 19th century can't be the deciding factor.",
  "Your Honor. That may well be true. I was -- I was working with the assumption that there may be Justices who -- of the view that married couples do have such a right and I am suggesting that the real issue here is whether that fundamental right extends outside the marital context into other unmarried couples who form bonds and have -- and -- for whom sexual intimacy plays an equally important role in their lives.",
  "Yes, Justice Ginsburg. I think the Court in -- has moved from Griswold to Eisenstadt -- has moved in the contraception area outside of the marital context to the unmarried context, certainly the right -- the qualified right to abortion applies to unmarried people, as well as married people. And I think that the Court in -- in looking at this issue of the scope of the fundamental right to make choices about sexual intimacy ought to take into account not just the state of law on the books in the 19th century but a couple of other factors, one the change in enforcement in the last 50 years because the Court's fundamental rights cases all do look at current laws, as well as 19th century law and also even in the 19th century, the fact that there's no record of active enforcement of these laws against conduct -- of adults consensual occurring in the private setting and that's true for married couples, it's true for different- sex couples who weren't married, it's true for same-sex couples. The enforcement of the sodomy laws of this country going back to the founding involves coercion, it involves children. It involves public activity. It doesn't involve the kind of conduct that's at issue here. So you really have a tradition of respect for the privacy of couples in their -- in their home, going back to the founding and I think then what began to happen in 1960 was a recognition that we should take that tradition and -- and turn it into positive law on the books. And so you now had three quarters of the States who no longer regulate this conduct for anyone based on a recognition that it's not consistent with our basic American values about the relationship between the individual and the State.",
  "No, Your Honor, but the Court's decisions don't look just at history, they look at the -- at the function that a particular claimed freedom plays in the lives of real people. That's why contraception became an issue. That's why abortion became an issue.",
  "The Court has said that --",
  "The Court has said that it's going to use reasoned judgment to identify a realm of personal liberty that involves matters of central and core to how a person defines their own lives, and relates to key other people. It's about moral upbringing of children in the home. It's about procreation or nonprocreation in your sexual relations with your mate. It's about basic questions of what kind of a family you're going to live with and other intimate associations.",
  "They certainly involved the right to decide to engage in sexual relations with -- while preventing procreation, that's what -- that's what Griswold and Eisenstadt and Carey all say you have a right to do. That there's a right to decide whether to bear and beget children and then that right resides with unmarried people as much as it resides with married people. And I submit to you that it's illogical, fundamentally illogical to say that an unmarried couple has a right free of State intrusion to decide whether or not to have procreative sex or nonprocreative sex, but doesn't have the right to be free from State intrusion -- free from a law that says you can't have any sexual intimacy at all. There's a -- there's a jagged piece missing from the edifice of this Court's substantive fundamental rights jurisprudence.",
  "This particular law does that, yes, Your Honor, but certainly our -- our submission is that fornication laws and -- and laws involving sodomy regulation more broadly would be equally unconstitutional, because they involve --",
  "Right.",
  "Yes, Your Honor. I think first of all that the positive law, the law on the books proves too much because it intruded right into the marital bedroom and that the record of enforcement which may be more informative actually supports us rather than supporting the notion that this is something that can be regulated.",
  "The evidence we have is the -- is the absence of reported cases discussing arrests for that kind of conduct.",
  "Certainly it seems to us there's a significance to the fact that it has never been treated as, for example, drug use in the home has been treated. And people do -- the police obviously do actively seek to infiltrate homes to find that kind of activity, it's been treated in a categorically different way. But perhaps --",
  "The argument about 19th century enforcement is that they didn't prosecute anyone for private and consensual crimes involving adults, that they worried about children, they worried about public activity, they worried about coercion, but that they didn't worry about same-sex or different-sex sodomy. Now as to the equal protection point which I think I should get to in my remaining time. This is a statute which in addition to intruding into that area of important fundamental protections, limits its focus just to one small minority of the people of the State of Texas. It says that these specified forms of sexual intimacy called deviate sexual intercourse are illegal only for same-sex couples and not for anyone else in the State of Texas.",
  "Well, I think that would be unconstitutional under my first point, Your Honor.",
  "I think there is a multiple -- multiply unconstitutional statute, because it does the second thing as well, it says that --",
  "If there was a record of enforcement almost exclusively as to same-sex couples, I think there would be potential constitutional problems there, but the statutory language itself would not involve an equal protection problem of the same sort that we're dealing with here.",
  "I don't know whether statutes actually are written that way, Your Honor. The point I would make is that when a statute --",
  "That may be as well. I think --",
  "I didn't suggest that they're unconstitutional. My point is that when a statute is limited to one particular group of people, particularly a minority of people in the State, that that limitation itself has to be justified under equal protection, that that's a classification of people, not merely a definition of conduct. And that if the -- if the justification of the line that was drawn here is -- is insufficient as a matter of mere rationale basis analysis. Because --",
  "I think it would have to be justified by the State. They may well come in with evidence that this is not a problem that needs to be addressed or that the victims are more able to protect themselves, they may have -- they may have --",
  "Well, the one thing that I submit, the Court, the State should not be able to come in to say is we are going to permit ourselves the majority of people in our society full -- full and free rein to make these decisions for ourselves but there's one minority of people don't get that decision and the only reason we're going to give you is we want it that way. We want them to be unequal in their choices and their freedoms, because we think we should have the right to commit adultery, to commit fornication, to commit sodomy and the State should have no basis for intruding into our lives but we don't want those people over there to have the same right.",
  "First of all, the first law that's appeared on the books in the States of this country that singles out only same sex sodomy appeared in the '60s and the '70s and it did not -- and it does not go way back, this kind of discrimination. Now, bigamy involves protection of an institution that the State creates for its own purposes and there are all sorts of potential justifications about the need to protect the institution of marriage that are different in kind from the justifications that could be offered here involving merely a criminal statute that says we're going to regulate these peoples behaviors, we include a criminal law which is where the most heightened form of -- of people protection analysis ought to apply. This case is very much like McLaughlin, Your Honor, where you had a statute that said we're going to give an specially heightened penalty to cohabitation, but only when it involves a white person with a black person. That interracial cohabitation is different, and the State there made the argument we're merely regulating a particular form of conduct, and that's a different form of conduct than -- than intro racial cohabitation. And this Court very clearly said no. You're classifying people. And that classification has to be justified. And this Court at many times said a mere disapproval of one group of people, whether it be the hippie communes in Moreno or the mentally retarded in Cleburne, or indeed gay people.",
  "And what this Court does under the equal protection clause is -- is -- standard as a bull work against arbitrary government when the -- when there is no rational justification for the line that is drawn.",
  "We certainly do not think we do, Your Honor. We think this fails rational basis scrutiny, just as the law did in Romer, in Cleburne, in Moreno, in Eisenstadt, all of those laws were thrown out under rational basis scrutiny, because the State basically didn't come up with anything other than we want it that way. We want these people to be excluded. We'd had distaste for them. We disapprove of them. It's mere disapproval, or hostility, however historically based, is not sufficient. And certainly even applying the rational basis --",
  "Well, certainly Bowers is not an equal protection case and it didn't involve this kind of discrimination.",
  "No I was still talking about the level of scrutiny under equal protection, Your Honor.",
  "It's hard when you have these two points to shift back and forth.",
  "Three weeks ago, yes, Your Honor. The -- but the Court in applying even the rational basis standard has not been insensitive to the reality of what the world is like, and to the fact that some groups of -- some classifications tend to be involving minorities that have had histories of discrimination against them and that the overall effect of some line-drawing can be very harmful. In Romer itself, the Court looked at the actual effects of the -- of the amendment in the Constitution and all of the many ways in which it caused harm. Here you have a statute that while it -- while it purports to just to regulate sexual behavior, has all sorts of collateral effects on people. People in the States who still regulate sodomy everyday they're denied visitation to their own children, they're denied custody of children, they're denied public employment. They're denied private employment, because they're labeled as criminals merely because they've been identified as homosexuals. And that we submit --",
  "I think the issue of -- of preference in the educational context would involve very different criteria, Your Honor, very different considerations, the State would have to come in with some sort of a justification.",
  "Well, I think it would be highly -- highly problematic, such a -- such a justification.",
  "If that were the only justification that could be offered, there was not some showing that there would be any more concrete harm to the children in the school.",
  "Well, I -- I think the State has to have a greater justification for its discrimination than we prefer pushing people towards heterosexuality. That amounts to the same thing as disapproval of people's choices in this area and there has to be a more -- more reasons and justifiable distinction than simply we prefer this group of people, the majority, instead of this group of people, the minority. Justice Jackson in the railway express case said very eloquently that the equal protection clause is an important bulwark against arbitrary government because it's there to make sure that legislators don't avoid political retribution by imposing onerous burdens only on one minority, but that in fact the majority will live by the same rules as purports to impose on everybody else.",
  "Yes, Your Honor. We're asking you to overrule it and we think that the right of -- of the fundamental right of unmarried people to make these choices about private adult consensual intimacy applies for different sex couples as well as same sex couples and that Bowers was wrong for essentially three reasons, first it posed the question too narrowly by focusing just on homosexual sodomy, which is just one of the moral choices that couples ought to have -- that people ought to have available to them. And second in its analysis of history, which I think I explained already and third, and perhaps most importantly, in the assumptions that the Court made in 1986 about the realities of gay lives and gay relationships, the Court simply asserted in the Bowers case that there's no showing that has been demonstrated between the opportunity to engage in this conduct and family. And certainly while it may not have been shown in that case or even apparent to the Court in 1986, I submit it has to be apparent to the Court now that there are gay families that family relationships are established, that there are hundreds of thousands of people registered in the Census in the 2000 census who have formed gay families, gay partnerships, many of them raising children and that for those people, the opportunity to engage in sexual expression as they will in the privacy of their own homes performs much the same function that it does in the marital context, that you can't protect one without the other, that it doesn't make sense to draw a line there and that you should protect it for everyone. That this is a fundamental matter of American values. So those are the three reasons we ask you to overrule Bowers v. Hardwick as to the fundamental rights aspect of the case and that we think that that is an area where the Court should go -- should go back and reconsider itself. The Court has now left open for nearly 30 years the question of whether anybody outside has a right -- has a privacy right to engage in consensual sexual intimacy in the privacy of their home. And I submit to you, you know, while the Court has left that unanswered, the American people have moved on to the point where that right is taken for granted for everyone. Most Americans would be shocked to find out that their decision to engage in sexual intimacy with another person in their own home might lead to a knock on the door as occurred here and a criminal prosecution. And that -- that reality is something that the Court needs to take into account and certainly in so doing, it shouldn't -- in constructing its fundamental rights edifice draw distinctions between gay couples and other couples.",
  "I think that the state has --",
  "Your Honor, adultery is a very different case. It involves the State interests in protecting the marital contract which people voluntarily take on. And -- and so in assessing.",
  "Sure, the State is --",
  "Well, I can understand a law which says we're going to attempt to channel heterosexuals towards marriage by making them -- making it illegal for them to have sex without marriage. I can't understand that law under -- under that kind of rational which only regulates same sex couples and says you can't have sex but everyone else has a right to do that. As for adultery and all of the other parade of horribles which people have raised in their briefs, it seems to me you've got to look at the individual interests and the State interests and their dramatically different in all of those cases incest, prostitution, all of these -- bestiality, all of these things either there's very little individual interests or there's very heightened State interest or both, in all of those cases, so the idea that by recognizing the right of all adult couples to make choices like this in their own home the Court is going to open up a whole can of worms, I submit, is correct. If I could reserve the balance of my time, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I just have a couple of points to make. I thought I might address this question of what it was that we proved in the record below and whether or not we have, as a result, adequately teed up the issues before the Court without having put into evidence directly that this was a noncoercive act or a noncommercial act or a nonpublic act or things of that kind. Our position is that this is a criminal statute that has only two elements, it has a list of particular kinds of sexual intimacy that you're not allowed to engage in and it they have to prove as well that the two people involved were of the same sex. There was a complaint that was filed that listed those two elements. My clients pleaded no contest to those two elements but said that there is an insufficient basis for imposing criminal liability on them, because, first of all, they invade fundamental rights and second of all, because the law is discriminatory, while it's supposedly got a moral basis, it's a discriminatory morality, a morality imposed only on one category of couples in a State which does not penalize in any way adultery, fornication or sodomy for people of -- of couples that are different sex. Those are the arguments that were made and -- so our position is that that the statute is unconstitutional both facially and as applied here, because the State purports to impose liability based on those two elements alone and that they are constitutionally insufficient bases both for fundamental rights reasons and because it's a discriminatory state. The other point I thought I might just address for the moment is the public health rationale which didn't come up before. Essentially, what the facts are -- and I think this comes out to a large extent, it's undisputed in the amicus briefing -- the issue is not briefed in here because the Texas brief doesn't even attempt to make this argument, but it is -- the facts are that if this was the line between safe and unsafe forms of sexual intimacy it's as if the law cuts right across it. Regulating some of the most safe forms of sexual activity possible, including, for example, lots of safe sex -- same-sex activity involving women and leaving completely unregulated all sorts of forms of unsafe sexual activity involving different sex couples. So if there was ever a case of a law where the fit is egregiously improper and insufficient to justify the law under the rational basis test, this would be such a case. Unless the Court has further questions, thank you very much.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court held 17 years ago in Davis v. Bandemer that a claim of partisan gerrymandering is actionable under the Federal Constitution. But the lower courts have since effectively overruled Bandemer by requiring factual showings of plaintiffs in these cases that are both impossible and, I submit, irrational. As a result, the state -",
  "Well, the standard that I think was - the proper reading of Bandemer does not require that you show that your members of your party have been completely disenfranchised, to the extent that African-Americans once were in the South, or that - that your party has effectively been banned. The standard that was applied here required that you show that you're being prevented from registering to vote, from raising money, from campaigning, from showing up at the polls. Those kinds of constitutional violations don't make sense as an element of a partisan gerrymandering claim, because they're not about gerrymandering, and of course, they never occur. So if you're going to say the claim is justiciable, it doesn't make sense simultaneously to require people to establish those kinds of independent violations.",
  "Yes, Your Honor, and I would submit to you that - that - that history suggests that - that it - the Court should not go that direction, because -",
  "Well, what - what we've seen, Your Honor, because of the - the fact that the lower courts have effectively read - rendered -",
  "Well, we've never had a - an opportunity for the lower courts to actually apply a standard that says when does the map become so unfair that it's anti-democratic? What they have done instead is apply this shut-out standard, which doesn't allow any real scrutiny of the map.",
  "Well, Your Honor, what we - what we try to do is articulate a standard which is tied to the basic democratic values that are at stake and to the - and to the article I standard that says the people should ultimately be deciding who's going to be representing them in Congress, not the states. The one thing that's clear from the constitutional -",
  "Well, Your Honor, this Court held in Wesberry v. Sanders, and has since twice done - applied that again, both in Cook v. Gralike and the - and in the Term Limits case, that there are judicially enforceable limits on the extent to which a state, in exercising the procedural power to establish the times, places, and manners of congressional elections, can create an uneven playing field and attempt to try to dictate the outcome of an election.",
  "Your Honor, that's - with - with all respect, I - I - first of all, we don't suggest that you should somehow look at the departure from historical lines. That's not part of our -",
  "That's -",
  "Okay. That's part of the intent - yes.",
  "Our - our standard on effects is that - does not suggest that politics should be taken out of this process. As this Court recognized in Gaffney -",
  "The standard would be, under our - under our submission, can you demonstrate that it is absolute - that it is very clear that you could get more than half the votes and have no chance.",
  "No.",
  "But, you see, our standard is precisely the opposite. You have to show that it would - under any voting pattern, it would happen. There is no possibility that with more than half the votes you could get anywhere near half the seats.",
  "Well, Your Honor, we - we focus on this 50/50 point, this majoritarian standard for two main reasons.",
  "One is a - is a matter of principle, which is to say, when does consideration of politics go too far? It goes too far when we're no longer operating a democracy -",
  "- we're having a minority party control the majority of seats.",
  "Yes, but we - but we have a - we have a -",
  "We have a commitment though to the - to the fact that the House of Representatives is supposed to mirror the people and is supposed to be -",
  "- representative of the people.",
  "And we -",
  "The reason we are focusing on the majority standard, the 50/50 standard, is in part because, as this Court has recognized in Wesberry and it's recognized in - in - in Cook and it's recognized in Thornton, the states are not supposed to be deciding for themselves who's going to be representing the people. The people are supposed to decide. The second reason is that 50/50 you don't have these problems of distortions, which, as an empirical matter, happen in a winner-take-all, single-member district system. When you get to 60/40, the party that has 60 percent of the vote ordinarily would expect to get more than 60 percent of the districts. That's why you don't - you don't ever want to have a rule of proportional representation.",
  "No, Your Honor. The electoral college is not a majoritarian standard in the same way that we - we have here. Because of the Great Compromise, it includes two Senators are counted, two votes for the Senators in every state across the board, so there - that - that is the disparity between the popular vote and the electoral college. But in the - but the House of Representatives was supposed to be the mirror of the people and the - this Court has constantly policed the efforts by the states to encroach from procedure into substance, to try to decide in advance, as Pennsylvania did here. We would rather have two out of three of our Representatives be Republicans, even though we're a 50/50 state, and regardless of how people vote, we're going to determine -",
  "Other side of the aisle. Your Honor -",
  "Your Honor, experts will in all likelihood be involved as we - we have an example of the kind of expert testimony that can be given here. But this is not, to use another expression, rocket science. Experts testify in voting rights cases about how districts will behave. They use prior election returns plugged into those districts to make estimates about how they will behave, and it'll be the burden on the plaintiffs to establish - they have the burden of proof - that, in fact, it is true that if you get - that - that the - this favored party, with more than 50 percent of the vote, will have essentially no chance of getting half the districts. That is -",
  "We had a trial on the one person, one vote claim, Your Honor, after the partisan gerrymandering claim was defeated, was dismissed. And the - the state tried to justify the deviation by talking about neutral principles that governed this map, and so we had the opportunity to put a kind of preview of our partisan gerrymandering evidence on -",
  "That's - that's correct, Your Honor. At this point -",
  "I think the court does have to look at the effects of the deviate - departures from traditional district criteria -",
  "Yes.",
  "I - I think it - the - certainly under our complaint and under the - our conception of the case, you don't look at one district in isolation and say, this district is too ugly or too much of a departure -",
  "That - that's not our case, Your Honor, and - and the reason for it is, I don't think that this Court is going to come in and start imposing, particularly districting criteria, when an ugly-looking district -",
  "- an ugly-looking and odd -",
  "Only when - only when it's talking about race on either side of the line, and - and it could be that the Court would ultimately get to the point of saying a district that's too ugly and - and divides Democrats from Republicans ought to be viewed in the same way. But our submission is more like the racial vote dilution case, that not only are there departures would show partisan intent, but you have to look, as the Court said in Bandemer, statewide and see whether, in fact, the - the - the legislature has created a situation where a Republican votes counts twice as much as a Democratic vote in this state because -",
  "No, Your Honor -",
  "Well -",
  "- the way you identify -",
  "No, Your Honor. It's how people have voted and how -",
  "Yes. And it - it would again be the burden of the plaintiff to show that there are predictable voting patterns, that there's a large chunk of people who are consistent Democratic or Republican supporters who are being injured in their voting rights by means of a - of a deliberate scheme by the legislature. Now, the idea that these people are hard to identify is a little hard to square with a map, in which you have these incredibly complicated peninsulas going out to find -",
  "What the evidence -",
  "Well, what the plaintiff would have to show in such a case is that there's a sufficiently consistent pattern of voting in the state that a racial - that a political gerrymander is possible and it has occurred and it - and that it will - and that, in fact, in the future there will be an injury to one class of voters who have been packed into a small number of 90 percent Democratic districts, while there's a much larger number of relatively safe Republican districts. Now, you can say that's not true or we can't know it, but we all sit here knowing - know that's what they did.",
  "Registration might be an indication of voting patterns, but our theory is - is you look at voting patterns and decide in advance of the next election, will there in fact be a - a situation where it's impossible for - if the Democrats got half the votes or the Republicans got half the votes, it would be impossible for them to get close to half the seats.",
  "Well -",
  "This Court has - has made clear in a number of cases that the Government has no business discriminating against people based on their partisan affiliation or their political viewpoint, in contracting, in jobs. And it seems to us it would - it should be clear that at some point, a level of discrimination in designing the machinery of democracy, the electoral process itself, a - a form of discrimination that's equivalent to saying, in two-thirds of the district we're going to count all the Republican votes twice, in one-third of the districts we're going to count all the Democratic votes twice.",
  "Well, as this - this Court has made clear, both in the race area and the politics area, redistricting is a little different from other areas. It doesn't make any sense to demand purity and a complete non-consideration of these factors, but there has to be an outer boundary. If there's no outer boundary, then -",
  "There's a -",
  "Well, the facts shown in the Indiana case, in the Bandemer case, were much less severe than those we alleged here, in terms of - here we had allegations which were ultimately supported by expert testimony in the one person, one vote trial, that they would get a large super-majority of the districts with only half the - with half the votes or less. And in - in Bandemer, the facts as they were presented, there was no such expert analysis. Instead, they relied on the results of one election in which one of the bodies actually came out the right way and one of them came out slightly the wrong way. They had not supplied the Court with the same kind of evidence that we would propose to supply, and - and did not meet, at least as an evidentiary matter, the standard that we propose here. It might be that, in fact, if somebody looked at that Indiana map, it might have met that, but nobody studied it in that way. They were simply saying, look, it's really ugly, they've got these unfair, multi-member districts in certain cities, and, in fact, the way the vote came out in the House, the Democrats got more than half the votes and got only 43 percent of the seats. That I - that, I submit, is not a sufficient basis to establish the outer boundary that we would suggest you have to meet.",
  "What -",
  "Well, that's -",
  "Your Honor, with - with respect, I - I think that it is perfectly possible for somebody to look at a map and decide whether or not it does or does not unfairly discriminate against one of the political parties. Courts draw maps themselves fairly - fairly frequently. They collect testimony from experts, the map in Pennsylvania that was -",
  "If it gets to the point where one party's getting two-thirds of the seats with less than half the votes, in a democracy, I submit that's the place where it crosses the line.",
  "It -",
  "Well, let - let - I will - let me directly answer that question in a moment, but let me just comment. I think the idea of a rule that says you have to wait three or four election cycles to - to prove your case, it would essentially be - mean that the claim is worthless, because you're going to redraw the districts every 10 years, and there's an enormous amount of irreparable harm, as you suggest.",
  "As you suggest, there's already irreparable harm. Once you've thrown out all the incumbents of the disfavored party, they have new incumbents that have come in now. It doesn't mean that you can't have a remedy, and it would seem to me the very first thing you'd want to do, just as you do in a race case under section II is - is have a map which does not inherently pack and crack the disfavored group to the point where they don't have the opportunity to -",
  "Well, I think the inquiry would essentially be the same though. They - the parties would have to come with the remedial map, the - presuming the legislature would have an opportunity to draw on in the usual situation, in which they could show that it is no longer the case that there is such packing and cracking of Democrats that - that at 50 percent, they would have no chance of getting 50 percent of the seats.",
  "I assume that the experts could deal with that. In - in reality, in this country -",
  "Well, the -",
  "No, Your Honor. The - the - the test we're talking about here is - is if one of the parties would get to 50 percent, would they have an opportunity to - to have a majority of the delegation?",
  "Well, Your Honor -",
  "It - it might be relevant at trial if we ever get to trial. Our claim was dismissed. What we would attempt to show at trial, and I think we would show at trial, is first of all, not a single Democratic Senator voted for it. There were some Democratic House Members who voted for it, and the reason for that is because there are five Members of Congress who are Democrats in the State of Pennsylvania who are real, real happy with the districts they got. And the General Assembly, the Republican leadership said, well, if you guys want these districts, you know what - you know what the price you have to pay for, you need to get us some votes. So that - there are dynamics that take place, and in any partisan gerrymander there's going to be some really good districts for the disfavored party, just not enough, not - not a fair - fair allocation, not one that would allow the party to have a majority control.",
  "I'm not sure that I - that I have enough knowledge of political history going back decades to be able to tell you whether that's the case or not. It certainly will persist through a decade as long as the whole leadership of the state doesn't shift over to the other party, as long as the party that committed the - the crime, so to speak, maintains either the governorship or one house of the legislature to be able to -",
  "There's quite a number of states, including, as it happened in - in this round, a number of very competitive states, the - which caused quite a - had quite a consequential impact on the Congress, Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and now more recently, Texas has come into play and decided to play this game.",
  "Which, in order to fix the problem, once it already exists, you have to get both houses and the governorship back to - to pass a second bill. Otherwise, it's in place for the 10 years and then what also happens in most states is the state legislatures, of course, gerrymander themselves as well as the - the congressional seats, in order to keep themselves in a position where 10 - 10 years hence they'll still be around and in control of the process again. So there is a - a fundamental - fundamentally anti-democratic part of this, which means in - in the long run, you are - you do have very competitive states with extremely skewed congressional delegations. The - the delegation from Florida is 18 to 7 in a state that has a robust two-party democracy. Now, that - that ultimately is not democracy. That's our submission. I'd like to save the balance of my time, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me start off by saying I do think that our complaint satisfies the standards of the Powell opinion in - in Bandemer that it alleges that partisan maximization was the sole driving force behind this map. And indeed, we had the opportunity in the district court, because of the one person, one vote problem, for the state to come in and try to come up with some justification for their line- drawing other than partisan maximization, and the district court found as a fact in that trial that the map jettisoned every criterion that this Court ever identified in Karcher, other than partisan maximization.",
  "They -",
  "They - they - they as well can violate the constitutional rights of the people who live in those jurisdictions, Your Honor. And let me just address the - the question of whether it makes sense to wait and see how the elections come out and see whether there is, in fact, this anti­ majoritarian effect from the line-drawing. One of the real practical problems with that is that the lines themselves in a - in an extreme gerrymander like this, can - can effect the statewide aggregate vote totals themselves. You saw that right here where, in - with the history of votes very evenly divided in a - in a balanced map through the '90s, a court-drawn map. Suddenly with this gerrymander you had five Republicans running unopposed, you had a number of the Democratic incumbents defeated in the primaries because they squared off -",
  "Well, I suppose that that is in fact the case, but you can't assume that the - the vote totals under a gerrymander are independent of the effects of that. First of all, if they pair the incumbents, they're just not there to run anymore, and there's a substantial distortion caused by the map. There was some discussion by Mr. Krill of judicial races as the - the test of - of partisan balance in the map because the - the supposition was that judges, when they run, don't have any great personal magnetism, I guess. But he didn't mention the - the race that was cited in our reply brief, which - this was 2003 - where Mr. Bayer ran as a Democrat, got 52 percent of the votes statewide, and carried six out of the 19 districts. That is an indication of the basic fundamental packing and cracking that's in the map, and is in fact a form of severe discrimination, making some voters' votes count much more forcefully than others. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Government works very hard in this case offering a -- an almost bewildering variety of legal theories all intertwined, all intended to support what ultimately I submit is an implausible proposition, that there exists a category of mandatory, clear statutory duties imposed by Congress on the Federal agencies which remain totally unenforceable by the courts, unless and until the agency chooses to engage in some affirmative -­",
  "No. This is an entirely plan-based claim in this case, Your Honor, and our claim was that this plan, read as a whole, taking into account not just this page but the text on page 154 as well, was fairly read as a binding commitment that they would do this task within a year. As it turned out, they did it in 12 years. They did it in 19 -- in 2003. They finally designated these routes, which they said they needed to do in their exercise -­",
  "If they had said that they were going to do it in 12 years, we wouldn't have had any claim that they were doing it too late.",
  "And the statutory argument is that the statute itself requires them to manage these lands in accordance with their own plans. That's -­",
  "Not in -- not in this case, Your Honor. There -- I'm sure there are other provisions that were required in this case. But there are two -- there are several different kinds of mandates that we're trying to enforce here: the statutory mandate under -- of nonimpairment, the -- the requirement that they abide by their own plans, and also the NEPA requirement that they take a hard look at -- at the environmental impact statement requirement when -­ when new information comes in.",
  "Well, Your Honor, what makes their -- their position implausible is what Congress actually did in the Administrative Procedure Act where it very specifically said that -- that courts have the power to compel agency action unlawfully withheld and unreasonably delayed.",
  "And -- and -­",
  "With respect, Your Honor, I think the concept that decides who gets to bring the lawsuit is the concept of standing, not the concept of individual rights. And it's no -- there is no argument here that the plaintiffs lacked standing under this Court's decisions to enforce this mandatory obligation of the agencies to avoid impairment. And so I think that that's the right way to think about it. And if you look at the -- the finality concept and the right role it should be playing here, it's the inaction that has to be final, not the action that you're seeking to compel. It's -- their -- their reading of the statutory text puts the word final in the wrong section. Finality comes up under section 704 which says final agency action is subject to judicial review. Agency action, in turn, is defined as including failure to act. So as the courts, since the APA has -- was first brought out, have consistently said you look at whether the inaction is sufficiently final to decide this is the right time to bring a lawsuit.",
  "Absolutely.",
  "Well, two points, Your Honor. First of all, I don't disagree that the concept of harm is a key part of how you decide whether or not the inaction is sufficiently final to bring a lawsuit. We want to look at several things, whether the Congress imposed a deadline or a continuous duty, as they did here, whether there's irreparable harm, whether the agency is operating under a misunderstanding of the statute that is involved. The courts say in those situations, the practical concept of finality is used to decide this inaction is sufficiently serious that we're going to allow review now.",
  "No, Your Honor. There are many things that are -- that are sufficiently general in -- in the code that they could not be enforced under section",
  "Well, Your Honor, what you do is you -- you apply the usual techniques of statutory construction and then you look at the second thing, which I think it's important that we -- the -- the Court focus on here. You look at what the agency regulations say the statute means. And here we have two features of the regulations which the Government studiously ignores. One specifically deals with how you tell that off-road vehicles are impairing and the regulation -- the -- the interim management plan that they promulgated -­ and that's at pages 71 and 72 of the joint appendix -­ specifically says that any use of off-road vehicles off the existing ways that existed in 1980 when they designated these study areas, any use of it is surface­ disturbing and it -- is an impairment that violates the impairment mandate.",
  "It was promulgated based on notice and comment. It has been treated by every court that's ever looked at it as a binding regulation. It does not appear in the C.F.R., Your Honor, but it is -- it is a much more than a mere -­",
  "The -- I don't know the answer that there's a specific rule about that, Your Honor.",
  "It is certainly the -- the document by which the BLM has committed to guide all of its actions with respect to this category of land, the wilderness study areas, and it's been consistently enforced by courts.",
  "The other regulation that I think is important for the Court to focus on is the regulation dealing with what they're supposed to do when they find impairment caused by off-road vehicles. And this is in the C.F.R. It's at 43 C.F.R., section 8341.2(a).",
  "It is not in the joint appendix, Your Honor. It is quoted at -- on the top of page 5 of the other respondents' brief, the other red brief by the Utah Shared Access Alliance. And I invite the Court to look there. What the BLM regulations say is that when the BLM official on site finds that off-road vehicles are causing considerable adverse impacts on a list of things, including wilderness suitability, which is what we're talking about with the wilderness study areas, quote, the agency, quote, shall immediately close the areas affected to the types of vehicle causing the adverse effect until the adverse effects are eliminated and measures implemented to prevent recurrence, unquote. So the -- the rule is if there's -- if there's impairment being caused by off-road vehicles, you close it on an emergency basis and then you consider whether or not you're going to take other steps to -- to deal with it down the road when you open it up again.",
  "Well, the -- the regulation not only says that's -- that's what you -- that's what triggers it, but then it says specifically what they're supposed to do, which is to close the whole area, including the -­",
  "Yes.",
  "Right. And I think that -­",
  "Right. And I think, you know, in the real world, you bring a suit and you say here's how -­ the statute says don't allow any impairment. So it's a very -- reasonably specific statutory mandate. You have a regulation that says here's how you find impairment, and you have a regulation that says when there's a considerable amount of impairment, here's exactly what you have to do to fix it.",
  "Well -­",
  "Your Honor, there is no procedure that the BLM has for filing a petition or for doing anything to trigger any kind of a response. There is no process of that sort. The most that you can do is -- and we did this. They -- the letters are in the appendix to the opposition to cert -- is write a letter to the local field office.",
  "Your Honor, there is no place to go get a docket number and get any answer. You send these letters in and they just sit on people's desks. And there's also no requirement -­",
  "Well, those letters were part of an ongoing effort over a period of many years to try to get them to take this problem.",
  "Well, Your Honor, we -- we brought a lawsuit that encompassed potentially a -- a substantial number of these different wilderness study areas and related areas, but then what -- what happened is we made a motion for a preliminary injunction as to four and put on evidence showing the adverse effects in those four and asked the court to -- to address them and say they're -­ they're not -- they're not adhering to their statutory and regulatory obligations in those four. The Government took the position that even if we had sued on just one, that -- and the district court agreed with this -- that because it's an inaction case, no matter how clear the statutory and regulatory violation is, there's nothing that can be done -­",
  "But they don't say no, Your Honor. There is no -- they -- what the BLM has done instead over the -- the long period of time is avoid doing either yes or no and then coming into court and saying there is no final agency action.",
  "Well -- well, perhaps, Your Honor, but then you end up with an entire set of litigation over how many -- how much time it is before they have to answer each particular petition without any kind of statutory or regulatory guidance of how that process is supposed to work.",
  "Well, it's -- it's not, though, Your Honor. We were focusing on a particular mandate, a particular harm caused by off-road vehicles in particular places. And we're saying not every shall phrase in the U.S. Code can be enforced under 706(1), but when you -­ when it's very mandatory, where there's irreparable harm and the Congress clearly was trying to preserve its prerogative to make these places wilderness areas by directing that they be continuously managed to maintain the status quo, under -­",
  "Well, it's not -- it's not like we're trying to take over running the agency, Your Honor.",
  "Well, there is obviously going to have to be some application of judicial review and then some application of -- of the court's power to enforce the law. The alternative is to say that they can -- they could ignore the law indefinitely and put up -­",
  "Well, the -- the evidence was quite clear. There really isn't any doubt about it.",
  "Indeed, on -- on page 59 of the -­ the appendix to the op to cert, the Government flat admitted that there had been impairment. It wasn't like they were ignoring that fact. It's the -- this is a request for admission. We said admit that there's been impairment in the wilderness study areas.",
  "Your Honor, that's what this suit was.",
  "Well, that's the only part that's before the Court on that issue.",
  "We're not -­",
  "At the time the lawsuit was brought, there was no BLM plan or -­",

  "The difficulty, Your Honor, is that after the lawsuit was brought and as the preliminary injunction hearing was about to convene, the Government started exercising the exact emergency -­",
  "When the case was brought, there was no closure order in place, and we were told by the district court that there is no jurisdiction of the Federal courts to require that. As we were going through that process, these closures started to happen. And so I'm -- I'm having difficulty answering your question -­",
  "Yes.",
  "We -- we want an exercise of the emergency closure which would effectively amount to the same thing.",
  "Your Honor, if I could refer you to page 52 of the appendix to our opposition to cert -­ that's the orange document I guess -- this is what we did file with them, seeking the closure of these WSA's. This is the -- we're looking for the orange op cert, Your Honor, not the -- the joint appendix. And 52 is an example of what was done in the effort to get the BLM to act on -- in -- in accordance with its own statutory and regulatory obligations. And it says, we just wanted to point out to you there's all this irreparable harm going on. There's ORV's rampant in these wilderness areas, and as you well know -­ this is in the middle of the first paragraph -- 43 C.F.R., section 8341.2 -- that's the one I was talking about before -- directs BLM managers to immediately close areas suffering considerable adverse effects from ORV use and abuse. So we brought it to the agency's attention, and they, as -- as they have done throughout the period, simply didn't do anything.",
  "Well, this lawsuit was designed to ask them to do that. The only real things it seems like we're talking about here is whether the form of the lawsuit ought to have been in the form of -­",
  "But it may well be that the Court will recognize that all agencies have to respond to these things and you can sue them. The -- the reality is BLM, unlike many other parts of the Interior Department, doesn't have a process for allowing you to petition for an order and -- and have a formal process for it being adjudicated.",
  "Well, it may well be then that -­ that once that's clarified, that this whole dispute will -- will be a matter of procedural -­",
  "Well, there -- there is not a lot of case law about continuing supervision. There are plenty of cases out there that say you can direct them to exercise their discretion. And -- and that's really what we were -­",
  "Well, I'm not sure that there's really a distinction between the two kinds of lawsuits that we're contemplating here. If we had brought this case and said, direct them to answer our petition about why they're still allowing -- they haven't exercised their emergency closure power in these four places, they -- they -- the court might have said, okay, tell them -- I will tell them to exercise their emergency closure power. They then come back with a thing that says, well, we don't think that ORV use is so bad after all and so we're just not going to do anything. And then you bring a 706(2) claim, and you have the same basic issues being litigated.",
  "Who don't apparently fall in either category, Your Honor?",
  "Let me -- let me touch a moment on the land use plan enforcement aspect of it because I think -­",
  "Well, that's one of the things they're worried about. They also apparently, until at least this morning, wanted to be able to write up these plans, go through a whole public planning process, coordinate with the States, do an environmental impact statement, all of this stuff in the planning process and then say, the plan, by -- by the way, is never enforceable if we don't do what we say we're going to do.",
  "No. The rule would be -­",
  "The rule would be they have to go through the amendment process, and there -- then you have an agency action which you can challenge. Their position is we don't want to do the amendment process because then we'll have to answer to all these people in public hearings. We don't have to have -- take any action because then you'll just go to court and sue us under 706(2). We would rather than amend it -- and maybe we'd have to do another environmental impact statement, et cetera. We would rather just ignore it and -­",
  "No, Your Honor -­",
  "The way that that gets handled in the -- in the run of the mine cases in -- in the D.C. Circuit and elsewhere is at the -- at the point of equitable discretion. One of the cases we cite, Barr Laboratories, is a case where somebody tried to say you've got to approve my generic drug within 60 days because that's what the statute says, and the D.C. Circuit said, well, we have jurisdiction under that, under 706(1), but we're not going to order that because there are 16 other drugs over there that are in the same situation. They don't have the capacity to get this done, and we're not going to put them at the head of the line because they brought the lawsuit first. The courts do have a lot of power in considering things like finality and then deciding about what kind of equitable discretion to exercise -- and the D.C. Circuit case law is quite sophisticated on this subject -- to decide whether they want to enforce in the way that is being requested. All we're saying is if there's a duty under the statute or under the -- the plan, the plan isn't amended, it ought to be something that you can get into court and let the judge look at and decide whether this is an appropriate duty to enforce at this time.",
  "They -- they may well be -- put that -- that argument forward, if and when we ever have a hearing on this thing. We were dismissed at the -- the jurisdictional stage here. They call it jurisdiction. It may well be cause of action.",
  "It would depend on the particular duty at issue and the kinds of harms that are at issue. Here we have a specific mandate that says maintain these places which you, BLM, has -- have designated so Congress will have the prerogative to make the wilderness areas when it looks at it. It's -- it's got a very clear, specific duty and severe irreparable harm that will happen if the BLM doesn't make it a priority. In those situations, the Federal courts are much more likely to say we are going to grant some relief in this -- we are going to force the BLM, or whoever it is, to follow the statutory obligations. In many other kinds of situations, when the agency comes in and says, well, we have 66 other things like this we should be doing, the courts are much less likely to do that. We're just saying that there has to be a power in the Federal courts at some point to compel adherence to the law when all of the other requirements are set, standing, finality, a clear mandatory duty which is perhaps better defined in the regulations, as you have here, all of these things, that if you don't have the -­ the residual power in the courts to take action at some point when the violation gets sufficiently serious and harmful, then the -- the provision really isn't enforceable at all. That -- that's the main point we're trying to make here, Your Honor.",
  "Well, that's a perfect example, Your Honor, of why this issue only arises in certain narrow circumstances because the FCC takes affirmative agency actions all the time and you can challenge those as being arbitrary and capricious and outside the statutory requirements. The difficulty we were facing here was the absence of any action to challenge. The agency was using its own inaction as its defense to being challenged for -­ for violating the statute. That's their -- their ultimate purpose. And I think -­",
  "Right. And -- and the -- the drafters of the APA really did say we think inaction is sometimes action and that that can be final enough that you can challenge it. And so -- so we think that's what the court said and that's what they have done for the last 50 years under the APA. They've looked at is this inaction sufficiently serious, sufficiently unlawful that we're going to allow a 706(1) kind of claim to proceed.",
  "Your Honor, I'm actually not aware of an inaction case in this Court.",
  "Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: There was a suggestion in answer to an earlier question that the Oneidas have changed their position about whether the land is alienable when in their hands. That's not correct. There is nothing in the record to suggest that. What the record does suggest at page 213 of the joint appendix is that Sherrill has changed its position. It wanted an easement on Oneida land in 1997 and at that page of the appendix, you will see that Sherrill went to the Department of the Interior for Federal approval of the easement under Federal law, understanding at the time the Oneida's position and the Federal law principle that the land wasn't subject even to an easement absent the Secretary's approval.",
  "Yes. And the land, when the Oneida's possession of the land, actual possession is unified with their underlying Federal property and treaty rights, the land is inalienable and cannot be sold today out of the Oneida's possession any more than it could 200 years ago.",
  "Your Honor, the point of Oneida II - - the answer is yes. The answer is yes.",
  "No, Your Honor. It's, there is an unusual twist to it, and it arises from the fact that there were illegal transfers 200 years ago. There was a suggestion in the Oneida II decision and it has been followed by the lower Federal courts that there may be equitable principles that constrain remedies in a course of order to be entered in a land claim action brought by a tribe that is out of possession, but the equitable principles that are at stake here are very different and they don't involve the same --",
  "No, Justice O'Connor. The Courts have ruled that we may not do that and it is the position and I will say it clearly here today that the Oneidas do not assert a right to evict landowners in the land claim area. Judge McKern who handled --",
  "We are not asserting a right to evict. We are not waiving any of the underlying rights that involve right to possession under Federal law and aboriginal rights and the point I'm making should not be construed that way. What I'm saying is that we are not asking a Court and do not expect a Court to evict anyone from action -- from land that is not in our actual possession.",
  "Let me give you a concrete answer. The key to the land claim is approximately one quarter the size of the Oneida land claim and it has gone to judgment and is on appeal in the Second Circuit. The judgment in that case after adjustments for interest and so on was $250 million and it was rendered against the State of New York only as the initial and continuing --",
  "Approximately one fourth -- the answer is 64,000 acres.",
  "Correct. The point of Oneida II is that a damages remedy is appropriate as to a tribe out of possession, but there is no suggestion that that is a judicial sale of the underlying federally protected treaty rights --",
  "Yes, Your Honor. Well, they're entitled to two items of value. They're entitled to retrospective damages for trespass, and in that the Court has not --",
  "Well, there is one parcel part of it that we have not sued upon because there was a 1798 Federal treaty that validated the transfer. The State, which feels that it was not bound by the Nonintercourse Act, twice went to the Federal Government for formal Federal treaty approval of these transactions. One of them went through. That was 1798. The other one was 1802. The President did not proclaim it and the State never went back to the Federal Government.",
  "No, sir.",
  "The decisions of the Court in cases like Atkinson and Montana address the lack of power of a tribe with respect to non-Indian fee lands within a reservation. I recognize that there is an added wrinkle here in that the Oneida's rights persist in that land, even though it is out of their possession and that wouldn't have the same -- that wouldn't have been true in Atkinson and Montana, but in that the Courts have held that the possession of the non-Indians is lawful in the sense that it will not be interrupted and the land title can be passed in subsequent transfers, we accept the proposition that Montana and Atkinson would prevent the Oneidas from regulating in any respect, let alone taxing, any of the land in the possession of non-Indians.",
  "The issues of laches in time is not within the questions presented in this case, notwithstanding that it has been identified in earlier decisions and was actually raised by the counties in this Court the last go-around. Laches does not bar this claim. These were illegal transactions declared by Federal statute to be of no validity in law or equity. The Oneida II decision which holds that background principles of Federal law which would ordinarily incorporate state statutes of limitation don't apply because their intention with the underlying rule that only Congress can impair or extinguish this right. Those same - -",
  "The equitable principles that would inform remedy in an action brought by a tribe out of possession don't apply when the tribe is in possession or else there has been a judicial extinguishment of an underlying right that's only within the power of Congress to extinguish. The Court has been clear that the treaty right here -- we have a Federal treaty and it says you have the free use and enjoyment of the land. In the New York Indians I, the Court said that means similar, the same promise made to the Senecas means that the land cannot be taxed. The argument has been made that the Oneida's only rights are to be paid off now, to be in effect have the un-extinguished Federal aboriginal right and the un-extinguished treaty right purchased. Those rights through literally 200 years of decisions are within the sole control of Congress. Oneida II made pains to say that this was an unusual situation fraught with some tension and problems, but those problems were for Congress. There are a dozen cases from this Court that deal --",
  "They did. The matter was litigated in the Second Circuit and resolved adversely to the Oneidas, but I would take the position that the Treaty of Canandaigua actually confirms the transfer of land outside of the retained reservation, so that the land that we are talking about today as retaining the Oneida's rights is I think approximately 270,000 acres.",
  "Yes, and that's why I'm not saying 300,000 acres. I can't do the arithmetic and I don't have the final survey --",
  "Around 270.",
  "In the Cayuga case, there were two elements of damages. One was retrospective, and that was rental damages for past trespass. The other was a current value, because Judge McKern said that he would not evict anyone, and that he thought a suitable alternative to eviction was the award of value, because it would put the tribe in a position through a free-market and voluntary relationship with purchasers to, quote, \"restore its homeland.\" Judge McKern got really to the heart of this process by recognizing that there are inequities all around, if you will, and that the Court is without the power to extinguish the underlying rights. It's Congress's role, but that there needs to be a sensible way of recognizing those rights today. And what Judge McKern decided is that damages would put the tribe in a position to do what the Oneidas have done with respect to the land that's at issue here before the Court, and that's to make, you know, a fair-and-square deal and pay full value.",
  "Yes, Your Honor. If I understand your question, the answer is yes.",
  "Correct. I mean that's the end of that litigation. There is a judgment, it's gone to the Court of Appeals, and it's there now. The issue of damages remedies when the tribe is out of possession is simply conceptually and fundamentally different than the question of what happens when the tribe has joined possession - -",
  "There are a lot of parts to that. Let me respond to what I think is the most fundamental.",
  "That argument rests on the idea that there was an assumption, at the time of the Treaty of Buffalo Creek, that the prior transfers were valid. It's an argument of ratification by assumption. Oneida II says, in a much more forceful circumstance, that even a later Federal treaty that explicitly refers to the prior session does not ratify it, because the ratifying language has to be clear and express, and you have to believe that both the Indians and the Congress, the United States, meant to do that. Here, the -- if you think about it, in what I just heard concerning Buffalo Creek, there's an interesting asymmetry. We're supposed to assume that the treaty covered all the land, but we're not supposed to conclude that Ransom Gillet's promises covered it all. We're supposed to believe that one, by assumption, extends to the entire reservation and that the other, forceful promises of a Federal treaty commissioner that you need not go anywhere, are actually very limited and carried with them a thought that they were extinguishing rights in other land. That interaction with Ransom Gillet is crucial. The treaty - -",
  "The representations from the Federal treaty commissioner were not that they could buy it back. The Federal treaty commissioner went to the Oneidas because they would not agree to the treaty. They didn't want to give up their rights. He gave them a piece of paper that was meant to assure them they were not giving up their rights. There was no suggestion in this important interaction that they were bargaining over the loss of other rights. Mille Lacs is directly in point here. Mille Lacs, I think -- well, from Mille Lacs, you can derive the proposition that where the record shows no bargaining over a right, and where the treaty does not refer to the right, the Indians will not be held to have silently yielded their important rights. In the nature of this interaction, you have the suggestion that -- you have a far more important right, in much larger part of the reservation, that persisted as a matter of Federal law. There is nothing about what happened at Buffalo Creek that would suggest that anyone would think they were affecting the Oneida's rights in lands that were not involved in the treaty. Now, the treaty - -",
  "Yes.",
  "Actually - -",
  "Justice Scalia, actually, it's interesting. In the Joint Appendix in the Court of Appeals, at page 413, is the actual document that governed the transfer of this land, the state statute; and in that statute, the State granted its right of preemption to an individual to acquire the land, because it understood that it had not yet exercised its right of preemption. That's, in the conduct of the parties, a direct refutation of the idea that the right of preemption was exercised in the Treaty of Buffalo -- in the Treaty of Fort Schuyler, the 1788 treaty. The most fundamental point, though, about the 1788 treaty is that next came the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua, which embodied a Federal promise to protect the free use and enjoyment of this land, and the Oneidas' possession of it. And that exact promise -- not sort of, like, but exact -- was held in New York Indians I to prevent taxation of the Senecas' lands. Now, I guess I'd like to make two quick points before I'm out of time. One is that, with respect to the idea that it's just too late, apart from the fact that the question is not presented, I want to emphasize that, in section 2415 of Title 28, Congress explicitly focused on the question of these old claims. And if you read the legislative history, all they talked about was how to deal with the Oneida claim and these old claims. And they not only provided that title claims are not barred by statute of limitations, and established a limitations period that would not have run against the Oneidas because they were on a Federal list, but they did the following, which I think is notable. The statute provides that these claims accrued, in 1966, on the day of the statute, there is no room for background equitable principles in Federal law. Where Congress has specifically focused on a problem, addressed it, the idea is, I suppose, that there is no room to fill gaps here by the Court where Congress has decided just what the gaps are and how to fill them. The other point that I would make concerns the Treaty of Buffalo Creek. The treaty's language leaves it to both sides to decide whether or not Indians are going to Kansas. The legislate -- the history of the treaty shows that the United States backed away from any language which would oblige it to remove Indians, and the language with respect to the Indians left them a choice. But, ultimately, all of that is controlled by what happened. The Federal Government made a decision that no Indians would go to Kansas. The idea that Buffalo Creek extinguished reservations in New York would seem bizarre to anyone in New York today, because the Onondagas have reservations, the Senecas have reservations, the St. Regis have reservations, the Tonawandas have reservations, the Tuscaroras have reservations, and the Oneidas have reservations. It didn't extinguish just the -- there's an idea that you can look at this in a vacuum -- it didn't just extinguish the Oneida reservations. Under the Santa Fe rationale, the point is not that Congress ultimately intended two reservations, although it has done that often -- the Choctaw, the Mississippi Choctaw, the Seminoles. It frequently happened with removal, that there were more than one reservations. But here, you would have to believe that Congress intended no reservation. You would have to believe that Congress quickly came to the decision that none of these Indian tribes in New York actually had a reservation anywhere, and that's not acceptable. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When the Sixth Circuit withdrew its judgment affirming the denial of habeas corpus relief 6 months after this Court denied certiorari review, it exceeded its authority to act under both the rules of appellate procedure and this Court's decision in Calderon v. Thompson. As to the rules, rule 41(d)(2)(D) requires, without exception, that the court issue a mandate immediately upon the filing of an order of this Court denying certiorari. That did not happen in this case. But because the court had no discretion under the rule to do anything other than to issue that mandate, its subsequent action withdrawing its judgment was tantamount to a recall of the mandate, which, under this Court's precedent in Calderon, cannot be justified in this case because the evidence simply does not support a miscarriage of justice, which under Calderon means actual innocence of the offense or actual innocence of the death penalty.",
  "Your Honor, we don't read rule 41(b) as allowing any sort of recall authority. Rule 41",
  "The mandate was not recalled - -",
  "-- because it was never issued.",
  "Your Honor, that is not -- not the rule applicable here because that rule applies in a different context. That applies at an earlier stage of the post-judgment proceeding.",
  "Rule 41(b) specifically deals with the 7-day period of -- of time for issuance following the expiration of the time for a petition for rehearing or the disposition of that petition for rehearing.",
  "It can, Your Honor, at that point.",
  "Because the more specific provision -- what the court had actually done was to stay the mandate pending a petition for writ of certiorari. The - - the - -",
  "I think that simply a plain reading of the rule and looking at the rule as a whole would preclude that result. And the reason is that the -- the specific language that -- that Your Honor is referring to speaks in terms of shortening or extending the time, the time being the 7-day period for issuance. That 7-day period is simply a period to allow the clerk a window of time to get the mandate out after the rehearing period has expired or after the rehearing has been disposed of. But it does not give the court carte blanche to simply withhold the mandate.",
  "That -- that's exactly right, Your Honor.",
  "The court --",
  "After the - -",
  "After the denial of cert, Your Honor?",
  "The --",
  "The rule does not allow for that withholding of the mandate.",
  "If the --",
  "If the mandate has been stayed pending the petition for writ of certiorari and that petition has been denied, the rule requires the immediate issuance. Now, there -- there may be and -- and - -",
  "I'm sorry, Your Honor?",
  "Yes, Your Honor. The mandate should have issued - -",
  "That was in excess of the court's authority under the rules.",
  "In our view the rule does not allow any other circumstances. Rule 41 does not allow any other circumstances. If that authority - -",
  "The State did not object to the - - to the extension, Your Honor, because the -- the mandate was of no consequence to the State in terms of the State's actual -- a State court proceedings. The State did not need the mandate to go forward with its proceedings, and in fact, the State was not authorized under State law to even seek an -- an execution date until the time had expired for rehearing. So - -",
  "The court simply ignored the -- the -- the process of -- of the case -- the extension ability in subsection (b) was never invoked by the court. There was a timely petition for rehearing filed, which automatically stayed the mandate under subsection (d)(1).",
  "That's absolutely correct, Your Honor. The court never invoked subsection (b) as authority for exaction. After -- when the petition for - - for rehearing was denied, the 7-day period in subsection (b) then came into play. The petitioner, or the -- the petitioner below, Mr. Thompson, filed a motion to withhold the matter, stay the mandate pending a petition for writ of certiorari, and that was - -",
  "That is our reading of the rule, yes, sir.",
  "It's our -- it's our reading of the rule that -- that the language employed in subsection (b) implies some affirmative action of -- of the court.",
  "I don't think so, Your Honor. A court in -- in our view - -",
  "I don't think that would constitute an extension. I think the language in subsection (b) requires some - -",
  "-- some affirmative order - -",
  "Some affirmative order of the court not only saying we're going to extend the -- the time, but to give an alternative time. That -- subsection (b) does not allow for -- for an indefinite withholding of a mandate.",
  "All this record shows, Your Honor, is that the mandate did not issue. So the reason for that is -- is not clear.",
  "No, Your Honor. There is no order in this record explaining why the mandate did not issue.",
  "Your Honor, I believe that a single judge would have the authority to extend the mandate, but a single judge would not have the authority to grant rehearing because that would be a determination of -- of the case.",
  "It is an unusual situation, Your Honor, but the court did more than simply write an opinion. The court entered a judgment on that opinion, and that judgment became final and became the final word of the court upon entry - -",
  "The court always have the -- the safety valve of -- of its recall power under extraordinary circumstances. Now, in a habeas case, that extraordinary circumstance has to be more than just this -- for some reason, I overlooked this. And -- and bear in mind as well that this evidence was in front of the court. Judge Suhrheinrich had this deposition for 21 months before that first opinion was entered and that first judgment was entered. So this was not something - -",
  "That's precisely what the court should have done in this case, Your Honor, in -- in our view. The mandate was required to issue and then the court should have looked at this extraordinary circumstance, this -- this unusual circumstance, and made the determination under Calderon whether that met the standard for a miscarriage of justice under the habeas decisions of this Court, specifically Calderon.",
  "Your Honor, we have not done that type of -- of inventory.",
  "Your Honor - -",
  "Your Honor, our response to that is -- is twofold. Number one, I don't think that -- that the Rules of -- of Appellate Procedure can be abrogated by the consensus of the circuits.",
  "If the circuits are not complying with the plain language of the rule, then -- then, yes, they have.",
  "This is an unusual case in the way that it's set out in Judge Suhrheinrich's opinion, Your Honor. But if you look at it and -- and look at it in the way that -- that it should have played out -- and the way it should have played out was that the mandate should have issued after this Court denied cert. This Court then went on after that to deny rehearing and the State moved forward. If at that point Judge Suhrheinrich looked at this deposition and believed that it established or showed an extraordinary circumstance, than a recall would - - would have occurred, and then that would have been an issue. But if you look at the evidence itself, it simply does not rise to the level of -- of extraordinary circumstances. It does not show actual innocence of the offense. Gregory Thompson has all along admitted that he committed this offense. There was no defense of it at trial.",
  "Assuming there is an extraordinary circumstance, I think to prevent the result of having to issue and then immediately recall, I think the court in that circumstance, assuming there was actually an extraordinary circumstance, actual innocence of the offense or actual innocence of the death penalty, which we don't think was shown in this case -- what the court could do in our view is to invoke its authority under rule 2 to suspend the rules for good cause. And in that circumstance, given the finality of the judgment, the good cause must rise to the level of a miscarriage of justice under Calderon.",
  "I think that's one interpretation of the rule, Your Honor. We read that -- the rule a little bit stricter than that, and we limit that extension in our reading to the 7-day period after the expiration of the time to seek rehearing or the denial. But I think that that is a -- that is a reading - -",
  "We read the rule (b), the extension period - -",
  "-- to be limited to the 7-day period after the expiration of the time to seek rehearing or the disposition of the petition for rehearing en banc or by panel or the disposition of a motion to stay the mandate. We limit that to -- that interpretation to a different phase of the proceeding.",
  "It -- it doesn't, Your Honor.",
  "I would like to address that, Your Honor, because I think that -- that the seriousness of this evidence has been vastly overstated in the concurring opinion of the Sixth Circuit. The evidence itself was -- was quite simply a deposition of a clinical psychologist who opined based on her -- some additional -- some additional meetings with family members and a review of the transcripts and other evidence that the petitioner suffered from a mental illness at the time of the offense.",
  "She did.",
  "She conducted some -- some - -",
  "Yes, she did, Your Honor, but her ultimate opinion was couched in the language of Tennessee's statutory mitigating circumstance, that - - that Mr. Thompson at the time of the offense suffered from a mental illness or defect that -- that impaired his ability to -- to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, but that was not sufficient to meet the legal definition of insanity. That is the -- that is the - - exactly the language under Tennessee's mitigator that - - that Dr. Sultan's opinion was specifically limited to.",
  "Your Honor, there is a disagreement in the opinion itself that - -",
  "Judge Suhrheinrich represented that he was unaware of the deposition, and I have no way to dispute that except to say -- I have no way to dispute his own personal representation. But Judge Moore pointed out in the majority opinion that the deposition was, in fact, before the court and had been presented for -- 21 months earlier than the initial opinion was entered.",
  "It was a deposition. It was attached to a motion to hold the appeal in abeyance pending the disposition of a rule 60 motion in the district court. That's how it came before the -- before the court of appeals.",
  "It was -- it was before the court by way of that motion. It was not properly in the record. But then again, it was not any more proper to consider after its opinion than it was to consider before it - -",
  "It was quoted in the petition for rehearing.",
  "It was directly quoted. The ultimate opinion, with regard to the mitigator, was directly quoted. But the -- the point that I was making earlier, this deposition in no way renders the -- the defendant ineligible for the death penalty because it does not undermine any of the three aggravating circumstances. It does not even make a prima facie showing of insanity under Tennessee law, as I've stated earlier. It simply tracked the mitigating circumstance under the statute, and as this court held in Sawyer v. Whitley, simply additional mitigating circumstances does not rise to the level of innocence of the death penalty. So it neither -- it demonstrates neither innocence of the -- the offense or of the death penalty. And even more so than that, it would not have even defeated - -",
  "Your Honor, I think it would have been one element of -- that -- that may have been considered. But in terms of the extraordinary circumstance, innocent of the death penalty or innocence of the offense, it would not rise to that level.",
  "That's -- that's exactly right, Your Honor.",
  "In Sawyer v. Whitley, this Court specifically said that and rejected the -- the contention that additional mitigation -- mitigating evidence would render a defendant ineligible of the death penalty. So this does not satisfy the actual innocence extraordinary circumstances. Nor would it have - -",
  "Your Honor, we -- we -- it would be mere speculation to -- for -- for this Court or any court to -- to conclude why this evidence was not presented to the district court. There are any number of reasons.",
  "Your Honor --",
  "Your Honor, my response to that is it is not that important, and when I say that, it is not that important because it would not even have defeated summary judgment. The - -",
  "That is precisely the argument that we are making, Your Honor.",
  "It is, Your Honor. The issue here is -- is whether Calderon extends to this situation. We think it does.",
  "That is what we're saying, Your Honor, because the effect on the State of Tennessee is precisely the same. The finality is the same. The judgment was -- was entered and final at the point that the court entered it the first time in January of 2003.",
  "I do not think that that would be a sufficient reason, Your Honor, because - -",
  "-- the extension period - -",
  "If the court felt -- the 7-day period is not to allow the court to rehear the case. If the court wishes to invoke - -",
  "-- a rehearing - -",
  "That would not be permissible. That is not the purpose of the extension. It is not to allow a court to continue to mull over a case once a final judgment has been entered. The mandate is not the judgment. The judgment is the decision of the court, and once the -- the court has affirmed that judgment, the judgment dismissing, denying habeas relief, the State's interests become paramount. Particularly at the point when this Court has denied cert, all avenues of review have been exhausted, the State at that point ought to be able to rely on the finality and ought to be able to rely on a court to comply with the plain language of the rules that governed it. If any -- if any body should be -- should be bound by the rules, it should be a court, and they should not be able to be abrogated by some consensus or just the fact that courts don't ordinarily follow them or -- or may or may not think that -- that it's appropriate under a particular circumstance. Mr. Chief Justice, may I reserve the remainder of my time?",
  "Just briefly responding to the question of the stay of execution under section 2251, there was a stay of execution extended by the district court pending the disposition of appeal -- of the appeal, but appeals are disposed of by judgments, and that judgment was entered in January of 2003. The State had a judgment which was final. The court of appeals denied rehearing both by the panel and en banc. At that point, the State, particularly after this Court denied cert, was entitled to rely on the finality of that judgment. The State did not need the mandate in order to proceed. A mandate simply directs the district court what to do next. It was not necessary. It is not -- it is completely independent and -- and separate from the disposition of the case on the merits.",
  "The stay of execution?",
  "The stay of --",
  "The stay of execution dissolved upon the disposition of the appeal. The stay was pending the appeal. The appeal in our view was disposed of upon the affirmance of the denial of rehearing. That judgment was final when entered. Finality was suspended only during the timely filed petition for rehearing. So once the court of appeals declined to exercise its error-correcting authority to -- to rehear a case -- rehear the case either en banc or by panel - -",
  "Your Honor, we have cited two cases on page 13 of -- of our reply brief.",
  "No. There was no formal dissolution of the stay. In our view it dissolved as an -- by operation of law. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. --",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question presented in this case is whether one occupant can give law enforcement valid consent to search the common areas of a premises shared with another, even though another occupant is present and objects to the search. The State of Georgia submits that the answer to this case is a resounding yes. It is reasonable to recognize that a person who satisfies Matlock's definition of common authority -- that is, a definition that is not based upon property-law concepts, but one who has mutual use of property by virtue of having joint access or control for most purposes -- can give consent for a search of that premises, in his or her own right.",
  "There has been some of that in some of the prior cases, Your Honor, that you do look to social norms. You've also said --",
  "I think that is --",
  "I think it is -- I think it is common, Your Honor. As much as one would like to think --",
  "Well, I think, Your Honor, we have what we have called either adduced expectation of privacy or a limited expectation of privacy or what we called a shared expectation of privacy, by making the decision, long before police appear at the door, to share this premises with someone. And by --",
  "-- that decision --",
  "I don't think that, even as -- in -- one could ensure that the spouse would honor the other person's wishes. I think this case is here to give some substance to the recognition in Matlock of the ability of the cotenant to consent, in his or her own right.",
  "I think, Your Honor, that would be a question of fact, under the circumstances, to see whether the husband has exhibited some exclusive use of that drawer or whether the facts would demonstrate that she puts socks in there for him, she puts --",
  "-- notes in there --",
  "-- for him --",
  "Well, I think -- looking -- we measure what is reasonable on the part of the police by looking to what they know. And Rodriguez made very clear, one does -- a policeman doesn't simply accept every invitation to enter. If there's some ambiguity or some uncertainty, the policeman has a duty to inquire. And, I think, looking into the facts of this particular case is a good example. You have police who were called to the marital home of Mr. and Mrs. Randolph. It arose out of a domestic dispute, because Mr. Randolph had absconded with the couple's child. The officer -- this was a small town -- the officer knew Mr. Randolph, because Mr. Randolph was a local attorney. The officer knew that Ms. -- who the wife was. And he knew this was the couple's home. When he got there, in talking with the wife -- Mr. Randolph was off with the child, hasn't returned to the residence -- he learned that they had been having some problems, but, in looking at the two conversations that ensued, the policeman learned that, despite the problems, she was back, she was living there. There was no separation.",
  "She did not -- she did not relay that to the officer. That came from Mr. Randolph, in his testimony at the suppression hearing. All --",
  "Well, Your Honor -- and I think that, looking at the tenor of the conversations, that is exactly what this officer ascertained. He knew that she was there, they had been living there, she was back, she had been on a visit. She did not tell him they were separated. She did not tell him she was --",
  "-- only there --",
  "She called the police. And what we have, more importantly, is a factfinding by the trial court that she, in fact, had common authority to give consent to search.",
  "No, Your Honor.",
  "That is our position, Your Honor. I think there has been some question raised by the Respondent, in his brief, trying to challenge both her authority over the actual bedroom, itself, which is an issue that wasn't raised below.",
  "And there had been an argument raised in the appellate court --",
  "-- about whether she had abandoned the property. But the trial --",
  "That is correct, Your Honor, as to not addressing the spectral situation. But I would disagree that Matlock simply only spoke to an absent nonconsenting defendant.",
  "I think you look to whether she has common authority over the premises in his -- in her own right.",
  "Yes, Your Honor, because, first of all, you said, in Rodriguez, the Constitution does not guarantee that a search, only with the defendant's consent, will occur. Your Honors said that --",
  "-- only a search that --",
  "-- is unreasonable --",
  "They ultimately did, Your Honor, but that consideration of getting a warrant was also at play in Matlock and, I think, in Rodriguez. And the point is, if one has valid consent, you don't have to get a warrant. They --",
  "Well, Your Honor, I think you -- we come back to the fact that he does not have a reasonable expectation of absolute or unequivocal control --",
  "Well, I think, Your Honor, its ability -- if we're going to have consent, and if we're going to have a third-party-consent rule, then this is an issue that is going to have to be resolved.",
  "I'm --",
  "Yes, Your Honor.",
  "Well, I think, in the Morning case that was cited in the brief, they realized one can always hope that the other will accede to one's wishes. But, this is the dynamics of personal behavior, and I think it comes from an almost subliminal assertion that the person who was saying no does, in fact, have absolute authority over --",
  "-- that shared --",
  "-- premises. And that's --",
  "-- that's out of sync --",
  "He was -- it -- he was silent. He had been arrested --",
  "-- on the scene --",
  "Well, in -- and even in that situation, Matlock, the reference to the absent nonconsenting defendant was in a paragraph where the court had talked about how it had reserved, in Amos -- the Amos case -- the question of whether a wife could waive her husband's rights. And then you had decided the Frazier case, and that was what was described as the nonconsenting absent codefendant in which two cousins had shared the use of a duffle bag, and the defendant had left the duffle bag with the cousin. The cousin and his mother gave consent for the search. And it simply was not that the defendant was not present, but this Court found there was mutual use of that bag that gave the cousin the authority to consent. And then, the Court readily rejected Frazier's arguments that, \"Well, the cousin could only use one compartment of the duffle bag.\" And you said you wouldn't get into such metaphysical distinctions.",
  "But --",
  "I think, Your Honor, we had called it a --",
  "-- a reduced --",
  "Yes, Your Honor --",
  "-- that is. And I think, looking at Justice Stevens' dissent in Rodriguez, there is that recognition of: When you make the decision to share premises with another, you have lost the expectation of exclusive or absolute control --",
  "Yes, Your Honor.",
  "Yes, Your Honor, I think so.",
  "I think that his -- his expectation is unreasonable. And we would urge the Court not to adopt that and enshrine that as the rule for fourth amendment, third-party searches. If there are no further questions, I'll save the remainder --",
  "Yes, Your Honor.",
  "I think it would -- it would have presented a much closer question of -- and particularly given the protection of papers and the fact that you may have business papers in there with attorney-client privilege -- I think her authority to consent it would have presented a closer question, although it would still be something to look at under totality of circumstances. She might have operated as a paralegal. She might have been his secretary. She might have known where he stashed his cocaine under a particular file. But that's not the question we have in this case. We're talking about common areas of a marital home over which both have equal access and control. And we would urge this Court to recognize that she, with common authority over those premises, has the ability to admit police and give consent to a search, in her own right.",
  "No rebuttal, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The evidence presented in the district court fails to raise sufficient doubt about Mr. House's guilt to justify review of his procedurally defaulted claims because reasonable jurors would not ignore the fact that Mr. House's jeans were stained with the blood of Carolyn Muncey. That is a fact that has not been undermined by any of the evidence presented in the Federal habeas proceeding. The enzymatic degradation theory of Dr. Blake was so thoroughly discredited in the Federal evidentiary hearing that it is highly unlikely that any reasonable juror, viewing all the evidence, would be convinced by it, let alone that everyone would vote to acquit in light of it. In fact, the petitioner's evidence of innocence was disputed in nearly every respect and sorely --",
  "That was specifically discredited by the -- by the testimony of Agent Bigbee.",
  "Dr. Blake's specific opinion was that his interpretation of the enzyme marker study, specifically the GLO1 enzyme on the jeans and on the vial --",
  "-- showed inc -- inc --",
  "-- which he took to mean incomplete penetrance.",
  "Agent Bigbee specifically disputed not only the literal interpretation of that, in that it doesn't mean incomplete penetrance. In fact, Agent Bigbee did not know what that even meant in the area of serology, but he -- he disagreed with the meaning that Dr. Blake ascribed to that -- to that definition -- to that notation.",
  "Which Dr. Blake concluded that --",
  "Agent Bigbee testified -- or Dr. Blake testified that the inc meant that the enzyme was not present, that it had dropped out.",

  "-- inconclusive --",
  "-- which means that the enzyme is present --",
  "-- but that he could not subtype it.",
  "But the -- the dispute goes beyond the literal interpretation of the inc. It goes to the meaning ascribed to it. And Agent Bigbee disagreed that Dr. Blake -- with Dr. Blake's conclusion that the inc indicated that the enzyme had dropped out of the sample. He said it was present. It could not be typed. Agent Bigbee also disagreed with Dr. Blake's overarching theory that there was equal deterioration in the vials -- in the blood in the vials and the blood on the pants. In fact, Agent Bigbee went through step by step --",
  "Your Honor, that --",
  "Dr. Blake was not reading his own report. Dr. Blake performed no independent analysis. Dr. Blake was reading Agent Bigbee's report. Agent Bigbee was explaining to the district court the meaning of the notations that he included in his report. But the -- but the dispute goes beyond just experts.",
  "That's correct, Your Honor.",
  "That's correct, Your Honor. The report at issue was a report prepared pretrial by Agent Bigbee when he did the -- the initial enzyme analysis.",
  "That's correct, Your Honor. Not only did the district court note --",
  "That's correct, Your Honor. And the district court specifically found as a fact that the blood spill --",
  "I think that that conclusion implicitly includes a finding that Agent Bigbee was -- was credible and Dr. Blake was not credible.",
  "There were additional --",
  "Dr. Blake's background is -- is that he was a forensic pathologist.",
  "He was often employed by the State. He had a history of -- of being employed by the State. At this time, he was not a State agent, Your Honor. He was not -- had not worked in any way, shape, or form on this case. He did not perform the autopsy. He did not view the body. He did not perform the enzyme marker study in this case. He simply came in and reviewed results and photographs that had been conducted and taken by -- by individuals previously. He had no direct responsibility in this case aside from --",
  "He was not a credible witness, Your Honor.",
  "Your Honor, Agent Bigbee specifically testified that the enzyme was there.",
  "He specifically testified on page 282 of the joint appendix. He specifically said, that doesn't mean it wasn't present. He also pointed out GLO should have been present --",
  "-- and said it wasn't.",
  "Agent Bigbee specifically testified that the enzyme was present. It could not be typed to any degree of certainty. So he simply called it inconclusive but that it was present. If it had not been present, he would have marked it N/A, meaning no activity, which was also included in the report in a separate location. But I think it goes beyond --",
  "The specific basis identified explicitly in the opinion was that Special Agent Scott, when he removed the -- the blue jeans from the hamper in Donna Turner's trailer, saw what appeared to be bloodstains on the jeans. That blood ultimately ended up testing as -- as positive for blood and, in fact, Carolyn Muncey's blood so that -- so that the stains were observed when they were removed from the hamper. He also noted that Agent Bigbee testified when he received the blood at the -- the FBI laboratory, there was no evidence of contamination. Agent Bigbee testified to the FBI protocols and said that if there had been any evidence of contamination or spillage, the evidence would have been returned without testing. So he looked specifically at that. He also looked and specifically pointed out a significant -- the testimony of Paulette Sutton, who indicated -- who was the blood spatter expert. She indicated that some of the bloodstains were mixed with mud, and to her that indicated that there had not been some accidental spillage in -- in an evidence container, that the mud and the blood would have -- were -- were combined to the extent that they would have had to get on the jeans at or near the same time. So those -- those things --",
  "Your Honor, I'm not sure that the evidence is undisputed that it was a dry day. If you look at the autopsy report that's in -- that's in evidence in -- in the trial record, it specifically says that it was drizzling that day, that the temperature was between 80 and 90 degrees and it was drizzling. Mr. House showed up with blood all over his jeans. He got the blood somewhere. I don't -- nothing is -- I don't think it's entirely clear that -- that the conditions were dry. His -- his jeans were clearly muddy --",
  "-- and it showed up.",
  "I'm not sure that -- that it's clear where Mr. House got the mud on his jeans. He was -- he traveled some distance from the site of the body and -- and to his home. He could have gotten muddy en route. I -- I can't explain how he got the blood on his jeans. I know he showed up with muddy jeans. He got mud on his jeans at some point, and those -- and the mud and the blood were -- were intermingled. I'm not sure that they got on there at the same time. I'm also not sure that the mud that Paulette Sutton saw was -- was created by a combination of mud and water. It could have been perspiration. It could have been any other type of -- of fluid. It could have been blood creating the mud. So it's -- that is -- that's very ambiguous, and -- and I think that the fact -- the significance of the testimony is that it -- it did not indicate an accidental spillage after the fact of the blood onto the jeans. And I think that was -- that was the point that the district court took from that. He wasn't trying to -- to recreate the exact sequence of events in the crime. He was simply trying to pinpoint at what point the blood spilled because there's no question the blood spilled. The -- the photograph shows it spilled. The photograph shows that the -- that the tops had come off. But the -- the photograph also shows --",
  "I think there was testimony that -- that the appearance of it seemed to be inadequate. There was no specific quantification of the blood, and -- and no one -- no one attempted to do that. It's not clear whether some of the blood leaked out of the container and maybe wasn't contained within it. There were -- there were pieces of gauze that had blood soaked in it. There was also a dispute about the size of the vials.",
  "Your Honor, I think what's important is the point of the spillage. If -- if the blood spilled after it left the FBI lab -- and that was a specific finding made by the district court, and that finding is clearly supported by the record. What happened to the blood, where it spilled after the fact -- and we know that it did spill -- really is -- is beside the point because --",
  "Well, I do think you're wrong, Your Honor, because I -- I think that if you look in the record, there are at least four witnesses who indicated that they saw the blood. One was Special Agent Scott.",
  "Well, Your Honor, the -- the photographs that you have are photographs that are taken after portions of the jeans have been cut out and sent for testing. You're not seeing everything that -- that the agent saw. Special Agent Scott saw what he believed to be blood. He couldn't -- he didn't know it was blood, but -- but he suspected it was blood. He identified in -- in the habeas proceeding the areas that he believed it to be blood, and it turned out to be blood. Jerry Morissey, who was the defense serologist and -- and, incidentally, just to -- that reminds me of -- of a comment made by my colleague in his argument about defense counsel's deficiency in not -- in not hiring a serological expert. He had a serological expert. Jerry Morissey testified, was a serologist, and testified that he received the jeans after the FBI tested it. He was unable to duplicate the result, but as part of his testimony, he said that he observed some bloodstains, what he thought to be bloodstains, around the FBI cuttings, and he attempted to do additional testing on those bloodstains. So he saw the stains. Agent Bigbee testified that he observed the stains. He didn't say that some were big or some were small. He said that he observed them. As well, Paulette Sutton in the Federal habeas proceeding said that she saw the stains. She said she couldn't tell upon observation that it was blood, but it was dark and she suspected it was blood. It was suspicious. So we have at least four witnesses who say they saw this blood. This wasn't microscopic. This was something that -- that witnesses -- and incidentally, Paulette Sutton's observation was borne out because she did presumptive testing. So the things that -- the spots that she suspected were blood in fact turned out to be blood.",
  "Your Honor, I -- I think of all the evidence presented below, I think that the confession evidence is -- is perhaps the least reliable in terms of -- of the Schlup analysis.",
  "The jury was never informed of Muncey's confession because the --",
  "-- the fact of Muncey's confession didn't come up until 13-14 years after the trial had already been concluded. And -- and that's one of the things that the district court, in -- in examining their testimony, found what was significant in his --",
  "Well, that's what the witness testified to, Your Honor.",
  "The district court did not specifically address that element of the witnesses' testimony. The court found that it -- specifically that it was not impressed with the testimony of a witness who waits. And -- and this Court has said on many occasions that --",
  "Your Honor, regardless of whether the witness waited or not, the Court examined the credibility of the testimony and found that it wasn't credible.",
  "That was one of the reasons, but the primary reason that the -- that the confession itself was inconsistent with the other evidence, and that was what the court specifically pointed to in his opinion.",
  "There were several disparities, Your Honor. The confession indicates that there was apparently an extensive argument at home. The testimony of the daughter both at trial and in the habeas corpus proceeding was that there was no such argument. She heard no argument. And the court, incidentally, found her testimony to be very credible. He observed her demeanor and -- and found her testimony to be credible. So that's inconsistent.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Your Honor, the -- the testimony at trial was ambiguous about the -- about the car. The witness identified two separate incidents. She heard a car and she heard someone inquire as to Mr. Muncey's whereabouts, and then she also heard an individual come and tell her -- her mother that her father had been in a wreck down by the creek and heard her mother leave sobbing. Those are two distinct incidences. And Lora Muncey testified that she did not know whether she had gone back to sleep. She never could identify or -- or define the specific length of time between the two. But logically those are two separate incidences. It doesn't make sense for someone to come and ask where Mr. Muncey is and then to say, well, he's down by the creek. He just had a wreck. So it -- it seems that just logically those are two separate incidences, and there's nothing in the -- in the testimony to indicate that -- that they're same.",
  "No, Your Honor. The --",
  "No, Your Honor. She heard a car and someone inquire as to the whereabouts of her father, and she heard her mother answer. And then there was a period of time where she said she wasn't sure whether she went back to sleep or not, and then she heard a person with a low voice come in and inform her mother that she -- that -- that her father, Hubert Muncey, Jr., had been in a wreck down by the creek. She heard her mother sob and leave with the individual who had relayed that information. Those are two distinct incidences. But beyond that -- the -- the court, incidentally, found her testimony to be very credible, found that her testimony did not support this -- this theory of some sort of confrontation in the house. In addition, the court also heard the live testimony of Hubert Muncey, Jr. himself, explaining his whereabouts, explaining -- and actually denying ever having made the statement. And -- and the court balanced that. As well, Dennis Wallace, who testified at the evidentiary hearing -- he investigated a missing person's report. He was in the home. He saw no evidence of any sort of struggle in the home. So all of these things balanced against this -- this confession, which has absolutely no corroborative support in the record, the court found that the testimony simply wasn't credible.",
  "There was a -- a wound to the victim's left forehead.",
  "The confession was that Mr. Muncey hit her and she fell and hit her head.",
  "It -- it could be consistent with the confession. It was -- it was very sketchy. There -- there was a dispute between the two pathologists in the habeas as to whether or not that -- that wound could have been sustained by -- by falling and hitting her head on a table and actually could have created the -- the damage in -- in the brain.",
  "Well, Your Honor, I think to answer your question is if you are at that mental state where you are saying maybe this evidence is right, maybe that -- that evidence is right, maybe I can go one way or another, then I think the respondent prevails in this case --",
  "I think it goes beyond just having sufficient evidence to convict, Your Honor. I think you also look at these credibility determinations and you look at the probabilistic result of a reasonable juror.",
  "That's correct, Your Honor.",
  "The district court heard both of the -- both of the sisters regarding the confession. The district court heard Hubert Muncey, Jr. regarding the alleged confession.",
  "My comment -- sorry.",
  "My comment on the DNA evidence is that the DNA evidence did nothing more than confirm what the jury was -- already knew was very likely, which was that the donor of the semen was the husband. The jury at trial was informed that the husband -- and it went through several pages. In the joint appendix, it goes all the way from page 56 to 66 where we're exploring that the semen could have been deposited by the husband or by Mr. House.",
  "There was --",
  "One of three, and -- and that was --",
  "It was at -- it was an aggravating circumstance of sentencing, that -- that the murder was perpetrated in the -- in the attempt -- in -- in the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate kidnapping or rape or attempted rape.",
  "Your Honor, the motive is -- is well supported by the circumstances. And in fact, if you look at the prosecutor's argument --",
  "No, sir, it wasn't.",
  "There was --",

  "The State put in the semen evidence, Your Honor.",
  "The State put in the semen evidence because it was -- it was not inconsistent with Mr. House and that there was other evidence in the record that was not -- all of the -- all this -- this physical evidence was consistent with Mr. House, just as the semen was.",
  "That's correct, Your Honor. You're looking at how -- how a reasonable juror would view the case if it knew --",
  "That's absolutely correct, Your Honor. If -- if the -- if a reasonable jury knew that the semen belonged to Mr. -- belonged to Mr. Muncey and not Mr. House, the result would be exactly the same because Carolyn Muncey's blood was all over Mr. House's pants. That is an indisputable fact. And all of this --",
  "Your Honor, I disagree that -- that they made a big deal. They made a big deal of the kidnapping at the sentencing phase. That was -- that was of significance. The -- what the prosecutor did --",
  "Your Honor, the -- the sentencing phase argument is not contained in -- in the joint appendix. The closing argument from the guilt phase is contained in -- in the joint appendix, but it's certainly in the -- in the transcripts before the Court. What -- what the prosecutor focused on at sentencing was -- was the kidnapping and also was the malice and -- and I'm sorry -- the -- specifically the kidnapping --",
  "The --",
  "At the sentencing phase, the prosecutor said that the evidence would have been consistent with sexual molestation, I think was the word that he used.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Texas legislature passed a new congressional districting map in 2003 for only one reason: maximizing the number of Republicans who would represent the State of Texas in Congress. Even though the existing lawful map already had 20 of 32 districts which strongly favored the Republicans, lawmakers went to extraordinary lengths to lock in control of 22 districts, moving around 8 million people into new districts, abandoning concerns about compactness, wherever necessary, and most importantly, segregating the population by race and by politics into 32 districts which are extremely noncompetitive.",
  "Your Honor, the finding of the district court, which we're relying on here, was that it was purely for discrimination based on partisanship rather than on the basis of race. Now, they started out by trying to engineer the defeat in the -- in the legislative process, engineer the defeat of the six Democratic Congressmen who had managed to be elected in Republican-leaning districts because they were moderate to conservative and they were, as the district court put it, able to appeal to voters to split their tickets and vote for them in 2002. By the end of the legislative process, they went further and decided to take the risk of eliminating one of only four districts in the State in which African Americans had an opportunity to elect candidates of their choice and also to eliminate one of the Hispanic opportunity districts in south Texas. Now, in the latter case, they did try to replace that with another Hispanic opportunity district, but that was the one that we've called the land bridge district, District 25, which spans 300 miles, linking up urban concentrations of Latinos in Austin and in McAllen down on the Mexican border.",
  "Your Honor, we --",
  "Your Honor, the retrogression problem was created by the fact that they had gotten rid of a much more natural -- naturally occurring --",
  "Exactly, Your Honor, and that's the argument that was made and rejected expressly by this Court in Bush v. Vera, that we had to make an ugly minority district rather than a compact minority district because if we did it the other way, a nearby incumbent would lose his seat. That was precisely the argument that was made there, that it was really incumbency protection, and we had to make it this ugly district to send that excessive racial message in order to protect other nearby incumbents, an argument which is mirrored here exactly and -- and as to which I notice the -- the State of Texas offers no response.",
  "I think the State has to stay within the constitutional confines of the Shaw v. Reno doctrine which would require it not to go so far in the pursuit of its political agenda that it creates a district -- has to -- has to create a minority opportunity district somewhere that would otherwise violate Shaw. Now --",
  "District.",
  "I don't think that it makes a constitutional difference under this Court's cases whether or not the reason they decided to place the district there and give it that configuration was because they had a political agenda somewhere else. The -- the fact of the matter is they -- they were deliberately trying to create an Hispanic majority district there, and to do it, they had to go all the way up to Austin and grab 300,000 Latinos and link them up with --",
  "Our point, Your Honor, is that in this situation, doing it this way, the -- the motivation predominates over the other legitimate districting criteria, which I think under Bush and under --",
  "Well, the -- the racial motivation to create a district -- to -- to reach out as far as they did to capture --",
  "Our submission is that they cannot, Your Honor. Now, if I could turn to the partisanship issue, our --",
  "Sure.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes, Your Honor, and that they can't say we have to create it in a non-compact way where the race predominates over the other values because we have a political agenda of protecting some other incumbent in a non-minority district.",
  "Well, Your Honor, I think there's a question of what you mean by the word predominance. And I as understand the Court's cases, there are times when the shape and the extra efforts that are made to -- to kind of gather up minority voters as, for example, in Miller v. Johnson where we had a very similar district, where race is said to predominate in a different sense than it does when you simply are creating a minority district to avoid retrogression or to -- to stay in compliance with the Voting Rights Act. Clearly, the Voting Rights Act requires you to create minority districts. It should require that it makes sense that people make efforts to do that. We're not saying you shouldn't do any of those things. We're just saying in this instance, under this Court's cases, you shouldn't be able to use your political agenda to allow you and justify you to do it in a different way which sends this extra message of excessive racial consideration.",
  "I think, Your Honor, you certainly can --",
  "You certainly can intentionally create a minority district under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. I don't know how you could comply with section 2 of the Voting Rights Act if you don't do that in situations where, under the Gingles criteria, that's what you're supposed to do.",
  "Yes, Your Honor.",
  "No, I actually don't agree with that, Your Honor, and you're right.",
  "That's correct, Your Honor.",
  "That's correct, Your Honor.",
  "Right, but -- but our challenge under the Equal Protection Clause --",
  "It's a little hard to keep all the different arguments straight, but yes. Our argument is based on intent there, yes, Your Honor. And -- and the argument is that the intent went too far because they had to --",
  "Well, I think there are situations in which you have a political motive overarching the entire map, and that -- but at the same time, that pushes you to do some things which could violate the Fourteenth Amendment in terms of racial conduct. And that's what this -- that's what our argument is --",
  "That's correct, Your Honor, yes. We don't think it's a defense in this instance.",
  "Your Honor, if I understand the question, I -- if the question is is it permissible to have --",
  "Okay.",
  "No, Your Honor.",
  "Certainly not. Now, we have a -- an argument about that too, which has to do with the district in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and I think the political defense there doesn't have anything to do with it. Now, if -- if I could, I think that the whole map -- the decision to redraw the whole map violates the Equal Protection Clause for a wholly different reason, which was that it was wholly lacking in any rational, legitimate public purpose. At the time, there was a lawful map in place that had the right number of districts, and the district court found as fact that the only reason that this law was even considered, let alone passed, was to help one political party gain more seats in the Congress at the expense of the other.",
  "The --",
  "It was the first one done by the legislature because they violated the Constitution intentionally when they had an obligation to -- to draw a map 2 years earlier. Our submission is that the existence of some power that the legislature may have to -- to alter the remedial map -- and they may well have that power. We don't -- we don't question that -- doesn't justify the map. They still have to, in exercising that power, point to some constitutional basis for which they're acting.",
  "Your Honor, we --",
  "-- we acknowledge that we tolerate political motivation in the context of map- drawing when there's other legitimate public purposes being served, which is to say at the beginning of the decade when they have to redraw the map anyway.",
  "But our position is when it's purely for partisan motivation, which is -- only occurs in mid-decade --",
  "That -- that is not, we believe, a justification for two reasons, Your Honor. This notion that you can have compensatory gerrymandering and that that can be your justification -- I think it's wrong as a matter of law because all it amounts to is another way of saying we like -- we don't like the partisan composition of the delegation that the people voted for and we're going to change it.",
  "Well, Your Honor, as the district court found -- and this is on page 85 of our jurisdictional statement appendix -- it wasn't that there was bias in the map that the court drew. It was that there were 20 of 32 districts that strongly favored the Republicans in the court-drawn map. It just so happened that the voters in those districts, in six of those Republican-leaning districts, happened to like voting for moderate to conservative Democrats who they were comfortable with. Now, if you tell me -- I -- I find difficulty -- I find it difficult to understand how anyone could say the legislature can, as a matter of -- use the machinery of government to decide that those voters should not have that opportunity to do that again, that that was a mistake.",
  "My -- my answers to that are twofold. I think as a matter of law that the Court should hold that -- if that's the only justification, you ought to wait until you have other public purposes for redrawing the lines. But even if that were -- even if the Court is going to allow that kind of justification for mid-decade redistricting, it shouldn't allow it here because it was just factually untrue, as the district court found.",
  "Well, Your Honor, I think that if the Court --",
  "I think it's a dangerous thing to do, to say to the legislatures of the country you can't redistrict for partisan gain, but if you can recouch it as partisan compensation, that's okay.",
  "I think if a map is illegal, Your Honor, then -- then certainly it is within the power of -- of the legislature to --",
  "I have, Your Honor.",
  "My response is -- is -- factual response is that by the time we got to 2002, the district court's drawn map had 20 of 32 districts, which voted overwhelmingly Republican for every other office, in the range of 60 to 70 percent, so that whatever bias was introduced into the map in 1991, if there was one, had been eradicated because all of these Democrats in those districts had become more Republican. And so the map was not biased. There was nothing wrong with the lines.",
  "You look to the court's finding on page 85 which said that 20 of 32 districts favored the Republicans. And you look at the expert reports filed by both sides at the trial that preceded that finding, and the experts for both sides said that the court-drawn map was a pro-Republican map that favored the Republicans or, at minimum, was fair, and that with the kind of voting patterns that existed in Texas at the time, one would expect the Republicans to carry 20 districts in most of the elections. Now, they also said -- and -- and this is a reason why the State didn't actually put their expert on the stand -- that the map that the legislature had drawn instead was wildly biased in favor of the Republicans in that at 52 percent of the vote, they would still get 22 districts, and at 50 percent of the vote, they'd still get 20 districts.",
  "The plan gave them 20 districts in which they had a strong Republican majority. Now, what that means is that --",
  "I say they -- that given that opportunity to have 20 districts elect Congressmen, that's -- that's all that anybody could reasonably ask for. That's the only kind of justification that I can even imagine justifying purely partisan redistricting in mid-decade. The fact of the matter is the large majority of the Members of Congress who went to Washington after the 2002 election were elected by Republicans in Republican districts. That's what the facts are. Now, they say, well, vestiges of the past gerrymander are still around, but what does that mean? The fact is the districts are by now overwhelmingly Republican in the large majority of cases.",
  "Our -- our position is slightly different.",
  "There may be cases where you could do mid-decade redistricting for neutral, legitimate public purposes. I submit they'll be quite rare in -- in practice, but there certainly could be. Our position is you can't redraw the lines purely for partisan gain, and the case I would point to that I think most strongly speaks to that is Cox v. Larios. In that case, the district court found that population deviations, sufficiently small that they weren't even usually requiring justifications, didn't pass the rational basis test because the only explanation you could offer for those deviations was that they were systematically attempting to help the Democrats at the expense of the Republicans.",
  "That -- that might be a concern, Your Honor. I don't think the -- the historical practice supports it because the fact is that while there's been a fair amount of partisan redistricting, whatever one wants to call it, in the last several decades, there have been precious few, if any, examples of anybody trying to convene the legislature before the next census to try to fix it. It is extraordinarily rare. And the reason for it is we -- there's a general tradition we've established in this country that whatever happens when those lines get drawn, even if it's done by a court, you leave it alone until the next time --",
  "The -- the reason I -- I slipped it in is that in my description of what I think is the current tradition, Your Honor, is we went and looked and found how many court-drawn congressional district maps have there been in this country in the last 40 years, and how many times were they redrawn by the legislature. And the answer is that if you go back between 1970 and 2000, there were 36 of them, and only two of them were redrawn in very small, technical ways, one in Hawaii where they only have two districts and then the one in Texas, which was changed in Dallas. It's not --",
  "Well, Your Honor, the other thing I think about this -- this argument about that we have this -- this need to have a legislative plan is you invite an abuse of a different kind. If you -- if you say to the legislature, you can sit on your hands at the time when you have an undisputed constitutional obligation to redraw the lines at the beginning of -- of the decade, as long -- and you'll know that what that will do is it will give you the right to come along anytime you feel like it when you get your political ducks --",
  "That's absolutely what happened here, Your Honor. They didn't make any serious efforts to redo it. The only person --",
  "The reality is -- and the record -- there was discussion of this at trial by Senator Ratliffe -- there was not very serious effort to do this at the time. The only person who can call a special session -- and it does take special sessions in Texas to get these lines drawn historically -- is the Governor. He declined to call any special sessions when they -- when they had a divided legislature. Of course, 2 years later, when they had unilateral control of the whole legislature, we were calling special sessions like mad to get the job done. So --",
  "Well, Your Honor, there was some language to that effect. If you go back, though, and read the opinion that the -- the judges wrote in -- in 2001 when they actually were describing in meticulous detail their process of drawing the map, he specifically said then that they didn't follow the old lines, that they used neutral criteria like compactness and following political subdivisions, and that they -- this was not an effort to -- to come up with a map that matched the old map. The only thing that I think really fairly can be said about the court-drawn map is it did give a separate district to all of the incumbents, which is what you'd expect a court to do. They're not going to sit around and decide mutual incumbents ought to have to run against each other. And so it did have that effect, I think, of allowing some incumbency advantage to continue on. But it is -- it is not true that the -- that the court tried to keep some pattern in the map beyond that. The court specifically said otherwise in 2001 when it drew the map, and then it said in --",
  "But, Your Honor, the facts are that it wasn't slanted. The facts are the experts both testified from both sides at the trial that the map was fair to both parties and that it contained 20 Republican districts. And that's what the court found too in 2004. Then we have an appeal and we go back down on remand, and suddenly we're starting to hear about vestiges of gerrymanders. But the court didn't withdraw its finding of fact that there were 20 Republican districts in its own map. That's true. I mean, look at the way the votes were cast in 2002. There were 20 Republican districts in the map. The six districts that these Democrats represented who they -- who they -- the moderate Democrats that they were targeting -- the average vote for statewide office in that district was something like 65 percent -- 55 to 65 percent for the Republican candidate. I -- I looked, for example, yesterday at the -- there was an election for the Attorney General in Texas in 2002. It was an open seat, two -- two non- incumbents running against each other, two people from Austin. And the average vote for the Republican Attorney General candidate, Mr. Cruz's boss, in that election in those six districts was 62 percent for him and 38 percent for the -- the Democrat. So these were not Democratic districts. This was not a gerrymander in any rational use of the word.",
  "Yes, Your Honor.",
  "Right.",
  "It seems to me that one is not saying that it's legitimate in 1991. One is saying that in redistricting, which is a messy process, we tolerate a lot of mixed motives. We tolerate some consideration of race. We -- we ask for some consideration of race. We tolerate some consideration of politics. But that is dramatically different under the rational basis test from a law that is passed solely for political reasons because it doesn't have the other kinds of interests that are being promoted and protected in -- at the beginning of the decade. And so there's a drastic difference, it seems to me, under the rational basis analysis between a law which serves a lot of purposes, some governmental and public, some of them private, and -- and not legitimate bases for governmental action.",
  "Well, Your Honor, the -- the fact here is that the only reason they decided to change was for partisanship. That's what the district court found as a matter of fact. Now, the other legal requirements of -- of the map that are -- give you the -- the legitimate bases for redrawing the lines at the beginning of the decade were already satisfied because such a map already existed. And as this Court said in -- in Growe, the -- the court-drawn map, in some sense, changes the status quo. You have to say what are the additional governmental interests that are -- that exist and justify going through this process again and changing that map, which already is fully lawful, has been affirmed by this -- this Court as lawful.",
  "It's -- it's not a basis that can justify public conduct, State action. If -- if it was, then it would be perfectly okay, I suppose, to have government subsidies for some parties and not for others, or to have -- let some people use public facilities and not others.",
  "The question I think you need to pose is what is the justification for doing anything, not -- not for any particular line --",
  "Well, it seems to me, Your Honor, that if -- if the -- I was trying to get to an answer. I really was.",
  "It seems to me that if -- if you can -- if they can legitimately and -- and plausibly say, we are -- we -- we decided to redraw the old map because it was so departed -- it's so departed from these important principles and values like compactness and respect for subdivision -- so if that's our reason --",
  "I think so, Your Honor. If all they're saying is we -- we didn't go as crazy as we could have, but the only reason we did anything is because we want more seats, but we could have done even worse, that seems to me not a -- not a justification for action, but merely a -- a decision not to -- to be more political than purely political.",
  "Well, Your Honor, our -- our submission is it makes a difference when it's pure rather than merely one of the many things that is going on. If I could take a few minutes just to talk about our section 2 argument with respect to the African American --",
  "Sure.",
  "We have plaintiffs in every district, I think, on the whole map, certainly any district that would raise a concern under --",
  "Yes, Your Honor, but -- but I think that there -- there was a -- in the complaint there's allegations about where each of these people live, and I think that -- that we were very careful to make sure anything we were talking about specifically, such as, for example, district 24 in Dallas, we had -- we had plaintiffs. The -- the list is quite long. So there is standing, I think, for all of those arguments. Now, on -- on district 24, our submission is that under section 2, there ought to be protection for districts where the minority group does not have an absolute majority but where the evidence shows that it can effectively elect a candidate of its choice in -- in concert with a -- a predictable group of Anglo or sometimes Hispanic crossover voters, and that we think on the facts of this case, this was such a district because the African Americans in every case were a large majority of the voters in the Democratic primary and the Democratic nominee, in virtually every case, is elected in this district regardless of what -- what race that person may be.",
  "Citizen voting age population is 26 percent, Your Honor. The --",
  "That's not our -- our test, Your Honor. Our test is they -- they have to control the election, and --",
  "Your Honor, I don't think that would work because I think the way we -- we view what you have -- you -- the group has to be able to decide who's going to be on the ballot, and then you want to see whether there's enough crossover voting to --",
  "If -- if that group gets to decide who gets on the ballot --",
  "Yes. If that group has -- has picked who gets on the ballot and their choice always wins the general election, I think that's not an influence district. That's -- that's --",
  "Yes.",
  "I think there are a number of limiting principles that apply here that -- that suggest we're not just coming in here and asking for the Voting Rights Act to become the -- the pro- Democratic act --",
  "And -- and --",
  "The -- the -- first of all, there are not that many districts in which African Americans control the Democratic primary and then have predictable ability to see that person elected in -- in the general election. Where that is the truth, they then have representation of the kind that I think is valuable under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Now, of course, there are going to be limits. One of them is De Grandy. They -- they only have rights up to a proportional level of their proportion of the population. And by not respecting -- not protecting this kind of district, what you do is, in fact, condemn the people, the African Americans in Texas, to less than proportional representation because there is no other way to give them a district in which they have any possibility of -- of participation in the process and electing a candidate of their choice. This is the only place in Texas where it can be done. They're -- they are more than an eighth of the population, citizen voting age population, and they're only getting 3 districts out of 32 because the State of Texas chose to eliminate this district.",
  "I -- I perhaps have more faith in the ability of courts to predict the future than -- than that brief does, but -- but I certainly can imagine a rule where the court says, we're going to require that there be experience, not simply predictions by experts, in order to create a district below the majority level. That would be an administrable rule which would give -- at least give some protection in situations of the kind that we -- we face here. If I could reserve the balance of my time, Your Honor.",
  "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. As I understand the State's argument, it is that the rational, legitimate governmental purpose that was served in passing a new map in 2003 was to eliminate an anti-majoritarian map drawn by the Federal district court in 2001. I submit to you that's an odd use of the word in a couple of different senses. First of all, as the experts for both sides found and as the court itself found, that -- the court- drawn map was not unfair or biased in any way. It did not in any way maldistribute voters in a way that -- that hurt -- hurt Republicans' chances to elect Members of Congress. So when Mr. Cruz says that the problem with the old map was that a minority of voters were controlling the delegation, that is factually untrue. What happened was that Republican districts chose to elect moderate to conservative Members of Congress who happened to be affiliated with the Democratic Party rather than the Republican Party, but that does not mean that Democrats were controlling the delegation. The anti-majoritarian name is odd in another way because the map that replaced it, of course, is terribly anti-majoritarian, as the experts for both sides agreed. It totally flunks any -- any kind of standard analysis about bias in a map to the point where it locks in 22 to 10 regardless, essentially, of how anybody votes in the State of Texas, and it's going to produce majorities that are going to average about -- margins of victory that are about 40 percent in -- for the rest of the decade, even if the Democrats gain votes over time. Now, it's a dangerous road we're going down, I submit to you, if we start authorizing this kind of partisan festival every couple of years adjusting the lines. Now, we've had three States redo their congressional districts already in this decade, and if this Court were to uphold this one, I think we'll start seeing lots and lots of other ones tit for tat around the country. There's another particular aspect of this that I think is potentially dangerous, which is as you get further into the decade, the census numbers get older and older and more and more out-of-date. And what the line-drawers then do is they've got the census numbers over here, they know where the real people are over here, and they can exploit that differential using the old census numbers. So it seems to me that even if you're going to say there's a legitimate public purpose for redrawing the lines through the decade, we ought to require the States to come up with fresh numbers. The population -- one person/one vote requirements are so incredibly strict in the congressional area. Simply to sort of assume that these people can use the old numbers when they're redrawing the lines 5 years after the census seems -- seems mistaken to me and it does invite terrible abuse. There -- and there are mechanisms for getting new census numbers if the States really feel it's important to do so. Let me then turn, if I might, quickly to respond, I think, to Justice Stevens' question about what the record shows about the intent for taking the -- the African American community in Fort Worth and sending it up to Oklahoma, so to speak. That intent is set forth in pages 87 to 88 of the jurisdictional statement appendix where the map-drawer himself -- his testimony is quoted, and he explained that we had to find a Republican district in the -- in the neighborhood that we could -- we could tack them onto that could sort -- that could, quote, handle that particular component of the current county population, which is to say a district sufficiently Republican that they would be completely disempowered for the rest of the decade. Now, there was -- there was a comment from Mr. Cruz about how the district 24 was created for a Anglo -- Anglo Democrat to win. The district that -- that was talked about in the testimony was the district drawn in 1991. What Mr. Cruz didn't point out was that in 1996, that district was completely changed by a Federal district court in Bush v. Vera. The old district went way down into the southeast into the countryside. The new district, which is the one you see in the maps before you, was drawn by the Federal district court. It wasn't drawn by anybody seeking to uphold any Anglo Democrats' opportunities.",
  "Mr. Frost continued to run in that district, Your Honor.",
  "That's a different Federal district court. I was talking about the -- the Bush v. Vera court was the one that redrew it, Your Honor, not the -- not the one that's in 2001. Thank you, Your Honor.",
  "Your Honor, I would agree that of the three hallmarks that the Court recognized in Stenberg, the breach delivery is probably the least, the least central; that the other two hallmarks, the extraction to the head followed by a completely intact delivery after demise, were absolutely the hallmarks that everyone on this Court understood in Stenberg, and those, those lines, are nowhere in the statute that Congress enacted. Today General Clement seems to be arguing that there is a different line that's protected in this statute, a different line than the Court recognized in Stenberg, and the line is about where the fetus is when demise occurs. But, but this Court in Stenberg understood that even in a classical D&E, a standard D&E, as the government calls it, part of the fetus is outside the woman's uterus when fetal demise occurs. The Court recognized that fetal demise occurs even in a standard D&E when, after a part of the fetus is drawn out of the women's uterus, resistance is met, disarticulation occurs, and after that fetal demise. So even in a standard D&E the line that the government today is offering up, the line of inside or outside the uterus, would be violated in any D&E - -",
  "In terms, one-day protocol?",
  "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The Government throughout this case has quarreled with the plaintiff's statement of Stenberg and Congress quarreled clearly with the district court findings, but their real argument here is with this Court in the Court's ruling in Stenberg, particularly in light of the congressional findings that are, that are frankly unsupported by either the congressional record or the additional evidence presented to the district courts. The only course here that preserves the independence of the judiciary, that exemplifies the importance of stare decisis, not to mention the only course that will protect women from needless risks of uterine perforation, infertility, sepsis and hemorrhage, is to hold this act unconstitutional.",
  "No. In terms of the underlying medical conditions there really aren't, Your Honor, and it varies dramatically according to the practice of the physician. If a physician is in a high risk OBGYN practice, he or she is much more likely to encounter patients with serious underlying medical conditions such as the ones that the doctors have testified about in this case, the liver disease, kidney disease, heart, cardiovascular disease, cancer of the placenta, bleeding placenta previa, all of these issues and underlying conditions that makes the impact and the risks that are reduced by the intact D&E particularly important.",
  "No, we don't, Your Honor. We know that in some practices it's quite frequent, in some practices it's not as frequent because those are mostly hospital-based practices. But on the other hand, there's extensive evidence in this case, much more evidence frankly, Your Honor, Justice Breyer, than there was in the Stenberg case, of the, of the - -",
  "Because it's what sir?",
  "No, Your Honor. Hospitals, many, many hospitals throughout the United States refuse to provide any abortions whatsoever as just a blanket rule. There are some that will provide abortions in certain, in certain circumstances where the woman is obtaining the abortion because of a certain medical condition. Then there are women who are obtaining an abortion because they have chosen that that's the best course for them who also have underlying medical conditions. So if you're a woman who has chosen to obtain an abortion and you have an underlying cardiac disease, for example -- we had a case like this in Louisiana. The hospital refused to do the abortion because her chance of dying from the underlying medical condition was not over 50 percent. So the availability of hospital services is somewhat unrelated to this case, but it is, it is quite limited in some circumstances.",
  "No, not at all, Your Honor. The medical opinion in those cases is against abortion whatsoever and a refusal to use one's facilities to provide any abortion - -",
  "-- of any kind, not about any particular procedure. I'm sorry, Justice Breyer.",
  "Yes.",
  "There are many more in this - -",
  "That's right.",
  "Well, there is - -",
  "There are many letters written to Congress that are in the record. In terms of live witnesses, Your Honor - -",
  "-- there were in Congress eight live witnesses that testified.",
  "Right. Well, the important point, Your Honor, is that even if the Court applied the highest level of deference under Turner, the findings would be rejected and must be rejected, as all three district courts held, because they're simply unreasonable even under a Turner standard.",
  "Yes, Your Honor, it was, as was the brief that was filed, the amicus brief that was filed in this case in Stenberg was before Congress, and also testimony from numerous physicians in the form of letter. In terms of live witnesses, there were simply not that many.",
  "That's fine, Your Honor. I've lost track of my train of thought, though, I think. I think what I was saying was there were eight witnesses who testified live.",
  "Yes.",
  "And Your Honor, what I would say in this case, it makes none. While it's an extremely interesting academic question about the level of deference that should be applied in this kind of circumstance, here it really is academic because under, even under the Turner standard, if applied in a way that Turner actually applied deference, to carefully review the findings in light of the evidence in Congress and again in light of the evidence in the district court - -",
  "Well, I think there is, there's been some confusion about the word \"necessary\" and it's been used sometimes to talk about whether there are other procedures that could be used, as opposed to the determination that it is the safest procedure that reduces significantly the risk of very serious complications, not the risks of minor complications.",
  "No, not at all, Your Honor. I -- the issue of the scope and breadth of the law is -- I think the evidence clearly shows that this is a very broad law that applies to D&E abortions and, contrary to what the Solicitor General said about the intent of abortions, abortion providers like Dr. Vibhakar and others, they actually, their intent is always to remove the fetus as intact as possible, and the district courts have recognized that as an intent that's covered under the terms of the act.",
  "I don't believe a marginal benefit in safety is enough and I don't believe that's what we have here. The testimony from over, from at least 11 board-certified OBGYNs, from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, is that the reduction in risk is significant and that it reduces the risk of serious complications, such as uterine perforation, which can lead to hysterectomy and infertility.",
  "We don't have a quantification of the safety. What we what we have is the clinical experience of major leading physicians in the field, who've testified that they've used both procedures. In fact, many of them have testified that they perforated uteruses in non-intact D&Es and they've never perforated a uterus in an intact D&E. And that in fact is borne out by the Chasen study, a very small study with very small numbers, but it shows all the serious complications are in the non-intact group.",
  "Absolutely, Your Honor. I think that the blueprint that this Court laid out, that certainly is suggested in Justice O'Connor's concurrence in Stenberg, was rejected by Congress. She references three statutes, that if they had included a health exception, she thinks would have been constitutional. They all include the word intact. I think there's another narrower construction of the act too that is possible. Adding in the word intact, reading in the word intact, it seems to me, is not a reasonable interpretation of the statute as it is, but certainly Congress could have done that and other States have done it, but Congress set out not to do that.",
  "Yes, Your Honor. The -- the problem with the law is that because it's not limited to intact, it would in fact cover the procedures that are performed by physicians who intend to perform a procedure as intact as possible but simply don't expect that.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes. The doctors perform the same dilation protocols whether they are going to perform a D&E or an intact D&E, and that's true for Dr. Chasen and Dr. Westhoff, who performed both intact and non-intact procedures.",
  "It doesn't play out that way. Doctors do have different dilation protocols, but they are often looking for as much dilation as they can get. On the other hand - -",
  "It varies by doctor. For example, Dr. Carhart uses the same dilation protocol whether he's going to do an intact or a non-intact. Other doctors might try to do more dilation. And the doctors, importantly, can't control the amount of dilation they get, so a decision happens.",
  "Not - -",
  "Well, they are always looking for a minimal amount of dilation. Then people who chose to do another day of dilation, for example, that could add additional dilation. But for the first day of dilation, no, Your Honor. They don't seek more or less over one day. They might do a second day or - -",
  "Not in the first day of dilation, no. They can't control how much dilation is going to occur. They need a minimal amount and they are not going to shoot for less than that.",
  "Each doctor testifies about their own dilation protocols, Your Honor, and I believe that's in the Eighth Circuit appendix. Those -- those -- portions of that testimony, and are cited more specifically in the Eighth Circuit briefs, which goes more into the factual detail, Your Honor, but I don't have the cites right now. I'm sorry.",
  "Yes.",
  "Not if this is not limited to intact, Your Honor, because then you would be limiting D&E abortions, which is 95 percent of all abortions, to circumstances where the doctor could prove that it was in fact the safest procedure. And we've had doctors testify in trial, for example, that they refused to describe even intact -- regular D&Es to their patients because they believe induction is always safer. So those doctors, I think would still be at risk, and it would put 95 percent of second trimester abortions at risk in that case, to prosecution for performing a D&E when you should have been performing an induction procedure.",
  "No, Your Honor, because actually that same language is in the Stenberg, the Nebraska statute. It also was targeted at deliberately intentionally. I do think that if there is a construction that would narrow the law to a limited amount of intact D&Es, if you read the \"for the purpose of\" language in the statute, to be performing an overt act for the sole purpose of completing delivery, then - - or rather -- I'm sorry. For the purpose of performing an overt act that causes fetal demise, that does not facilitate delivery of the statute -- of the fetus.",
  "I'm sorry.",
  "No. I don't believe that's the line that could be drawn, Your Honor, because anyone who does a D&E is intending to remove the fetus as intact as possible, and always can have the intent to go to the anatomical landmark that's here. I'm suggesting a different interpretation that uses the \"for the purpose of\" language where it says for the purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows will kill the partially delivered living fetus. If that language was interpreted to be for the sole purpose of performing fetal demise at that point, rather than what the doctors do, which is perform the action that causes fetal demise in order to facilitate delivery of the fetus. So if it's not to facilitate delivery of the fetus - -",
  "Well, there are allegations in the Congressional Record, for example, in reference - - in Justice Thomas' dissent by Nurse Schaffer, Dr. Pamela Smith, about circumstances where the physician actually holds the fetus in the woman's body in order to cause fetal demise, rather than causing fetal demise because it's an integral part of removal of the fetus from the woman's uterus. And those circumstances would be banned under that interpretation. But I want to get back to the Turner point, if I may for a minute, the issue of deference to congressional finding.",
  "Well, it would -- it would ban certainly a certain type of intact procedure that was discussed, and I think is the image many people have of \"partial-birth abortion\" frankly, that this is something that's done gratuitously, not as an integral part of making this procedure the safest for the woman, and avoiding instrumentation and avoiding perforation and hysterectomies, which are serious complications that though rare, when they occur, they are catastrophic and life changing and disastrous. So the numbers are not high of any complications, but the complications when they occur are, are devastating. And this is what the doctors are experiencing when they perform intact D&Es, that they are not having these types of complications. So -- if I can move to the deference point, I would like to talk a little bit about deference to congressional findings because there is significant authority from this Court of course, saying that where there are danger signs of constitutional risks, as the Court recently said in Randall versus Sorrell, that the Court must independently and carefully review congressional findings. And the Court has rejected findings that attempted to change either by findings of fact or legal findings, that attempted to change a constitutional standard. But in any case, the findings in this case are simply unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. If you go to the findings themselves, the ultimate finding in 14o, which claims that it is actually relying on the preceding findings, it says, \"for these reasons, Congress finds that partial birth abortion is never medically indicated,\" and then you go backwards and look at the reasons. The reasons are the findings that are not defended by the Government, that were not defended by the Government witnesses and that are blatantly false, except for perhaps one of them. There are findings of, that partial-birth abortion poses serious risks. The Government witnesses agreed that this was not true. Their findings that partial-birth abortion is not taught in medical schools. Of course, we know that is simply not true, it's an integral part of abortion training at major medical institutions like Cornell, Columbia, Yale, NYU, Northwestern, etc. It says that abortion, partial-birth abortion is a disfavored practice among abortion providers. That is absolutely not true. And it says that there are no comparative studies. We know now that is not true because the Chasen study has come out, and is the first study of its kind to try to evaluate the differences between intact and non-intact. It is still true that there are no controlled studies, there is no randomized clinical trial, but if that were the standard, no new and safer abortion procedures could ever be developed. Turning back, Your Honors, to the health issue.",
  "Yes.",
  "Not very common. Not very common, Your Honor. It would occur in circumstances where there is a significant fetal anomaly and some kind of a, something called a sides, or another type of fetal anomaly where there is a distension of the abdomen, but it's very rare.",
  "I'm sorry. I don't know if I understand.",
  "Yes.",
  "Yes.",
  "Right.",
  "Yes, but these are circumstances where the fetus can't be delivered. That's the point, Your Honor, is that the fetus is obstructed and so the overt act that takes place is - -",
  "The obstruction would come from a distension of the abdomen, usually from a significant fetal anomaly like a sides, which is, this is a serious anomaly. It's lethal anomalies that I was talking about. And in those circumstances, an overt act would need to be performed that would in fact cause fetal demise before the fetus could be, the delivery could be continued.",
  "No, Your Honor. I think the - -",
  "I don't think so, Your Honor. What, what the Court held in Stenberg in applying the appropriate medical judgment standard of Casey, was that there had to be a substantial body of medical opinion, an objective standard that in fact supports the use of that procedure. And that both, that balances concerns against protecting a woman's health with a concern of unfettered discretion, which the Court has rejected.",
  "I'm sorry. I - -",
  "Yeah.",
  "That's true, Your Honor, as long as it doesn't pose an undue burden on the woman, which as you know, certainly the circumstance with the D&E, which is 95 percent of abortions, under the Stenberg ruling.",
  "Yes.",
  "I don't understand what you mean.",
  "No.",
  "No. I understood Justice Kennedy's question to be, could the State prohibit what it thinks is not the safest. And under the Stenberg ruling, although the Court hasn't addressed that question directly, under Stenberg what the Court has said is, the Court can ban procedures only where there is not significant medical authority supporting their use as the safest procedure in some circumstances. So perhaps I misunderstood your question. But the Court has not ever addressed the question, can we ban a procedure that's not the safest. I think the ruling in Stenberg would say well, there has to be significant medical authority that in some circumstances it is the safest. The alternative argument would be, but, if it is the procedure that's used in 95 percent of the cases, or a vast majority of the cases, and banning it would thereby deny women the right to get an abortion and be a substantial obstacle in their path in obtaining a legal abortion, that would be another reason why you couldn't ban it.",
  "Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves a law that directly burdens our most fundamental right, the right to vote. Those Indiana voters who lack the identification now required by the new photo ID law must overcome substantial practical and financial burdens before they can continue to exercise their constitutional right. Now, the State says that those burdens are justified by the need to stamp out the scourge of voter impersonation fraud at the polls, but this Court has made clear many times that such a justification should not just be accepted at face value, but instead it should be scrutinized to assure that the claimed State interest is both real and sufficiently weighty to justify the burden being imposed on constitutional rights.",
  "There are many plaintiffs, Your Honor, including the ones that the courts below found have standing, the Democratic Party.",
  "Yes, Your Honor, absolutely, and especially when I'm a petitioner I agree with you on that. But in this case, Your Honor, the Democratic Party was found to have standing correctly, I believe, on at least two grounds, associational standing as well as what you might call haven standing, the organizational interest being impaired by virtue of this law.",
  "Your Honor, in Indiana you become a member of the Democratic Party by participating in party affairs. They did identify members who are activists, who are poll workers, and that's why the district court said that as, as to the equal protection claim those people were sufficient to satisfy associational standing.",
  "Well, there are different degrees of membership, different ways to become a member, as this Court has recognized - -",
  "There is no formal method of induction as you would have in the Elk's Club or something, Your Honor. But there clearly are methods by which you become a participant in the affairs of the party. For example, to vote in the primary you have to aver that you have either supported Democratic candidates in the last election or intend to in a future election.",
  "Because they have -- the Democratic Party is an association of people joined together to elect candidates of a particular kind and those people include many people who are burdened by this law. This seems to be the absolutely quintessential case for associational standing, Your Honor.",
  "No, that's correct, Your Honor. Well, the court of appeals relied as well on Havens Realty and said that the organizational interests of the party are being impaired by virtue of the fact that this is putting a burden on them achieving their goal, the Democratic Party's goal, of electing its candidates.",
  "Extend resources getting people, get their identification. It's very much like the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority case which we cited in our brief, which involved a nonprofit organization aimed at trying to keep the noise level down at National Airport that was impaired by an unconstitutional statute in that case as well.",
  "Well, Your Honor - -",
  "I'd note, Your Honor, that in the Hunt case itself there were no members. The Court said it doesn't really matter because the State agency that had associational standing in Hunt functioned for all purposes as the representatives of those, of those apple farmers, but there was no formal membership organization, no members per se at all. But the Court said that shouldn't make a difference because there's really no actual functional difference between the two situations. I would certainly submit - -",
  "Well Your Honor, the thing that confines the rationale is it has to be something that relates as well to the purpose of the organization, of the association, the reason why these people are bound together as a group, and that is of course to get people to vote and vote to support -- support the goals of the organization, support the candidates, the nominees of the organization.",
  "But we also have other people in the record, Your Honor -- for example, Theresa Clemente, others who are active poll workers, activists in the party, who -- had been polled and found that they didn't have IDs and that they would be burdened by the difficulty of getting IDs. So that that -- there is specific standing evidence in there of specific people who, much more than just your average voter, are active in party affairs. They may not have a -- be card-carrying members of the Democratic Party, but they are as much a part of the Democratic Party as anybody possibly could be, who were identified in response to interrogatories, about 9 or 10 of them, and were found to be satisfactory for purposes of standing by the district court on the equal protection claim. Now, in addition I would note as I suggested to Justice Souter, you don't have to go to the associational standing because the Democratic Party clearly is injured in its own right as an organization. Now, if I could turn to the merits then, the - -",
  "No. When it's in its own right the association, the organization, is injured, Your Honor. Now, the question -- if what you're suggesting, is there enough evidence here that people are actually being prevented from voting?",
  "A great deal of evidence in the record of the burdens that are imposed on people who try to comply with this law and continue exercising their constitutional right to vote.",
  "Well, Your Honor, the record in this case was made when an election had not yet happened. So that comment, while it was certainly made, I don't quite understand its significance. This case was brought to try to prevent an irreparable loss of constitutional rights in advance of the implementation of this law. I think it had been used in two little towns in '05, Montezuma, Indiana, but other than that - -",
  "I'm not even -- there were a couple of hundred people that had voted under the law, but nobody else had yet, at that point. Now, the - -",
  "Yes, we did, Your Honor.",
  "Yes, we did, Your Honor. That's the 9 or 10 people who came from the poll worker survey. There was also a considerable amount of testimony about other people who said they wanted to vote, who spoke to many of the other plaintiffs, Mr. Crawford, the NAACP chapter. There's a lot of other plaintiffs who also submitted evidence of people saying: I don't have an ID, I'm not going to be able to get one, I'm not going to be able to vote.",
  "Yes, Your Honor. But what the State did in 2002 was it ratcheted up the difficulty of getting one by requiring for the first time that you have an original certified birth certificate that you paid for and that -- and then you have to go through the hoops of what kind of identification you need for that.",
  "Your Honor, it may well be possible that there's certain situations that it could require it. Each case is a balancing test. As the Court said in Timmons, you have to make hard judgments on the specific facts of each case and identify both the State interest being served, the incremental State interest being served, and the degree of the burdens.",
  "If it's readily available and not especially burdensome and there is some reason to think that it is preventing a fraud of some sort, serving some - -",
  "Well, Your Honor, it is true - -",
  "Well, it is certainly true that, in fact, there is no evidence in this record of any significant amount of fraud that is still occurring with the existing system of voter identification.",
  "I think -- I think that the current system works just fine. So if there's any degree of burden being imposed on the voter by some additional identification requirement, then I would say it's unconstitutional.",
  "Yes, Your Honor.",
  "If you had a world in which that were true, Your Honor, I think that would be potentially constitutional. That's a very different world than the one we live in, and - -",
  "Yes, Your Honor.",
  "Well, I was assuming that we would make some additional exemptions for particular people with those kinds of problems, if people can't have one. If the question is, if everybody has a photo ID in their pocket is it constitutional to require them to show them at the voting booth, the answer to that I think is yes.",
  "Excuse me, Your Honor?",
  "No, I'm not -- I'm not - -",
  "I must be misunderstanding. We have every reason to think that they will let them vote. The only problem with that exemption, like the indigency exception, is that it's kind of gratuitively burdensome in that you have to go down to the county seat to vote every time; you can't vote in your polling place because you have to fill out this affidavit every time you vote.",
  "Either way, your real voting place is going to be the county clerk's office in the county seat, forever. That's -- it's not that they won't do it; it's - -",
  "I don't know the - -",
  "No. If you're an indigent person, Your Honor, in Lake County, in Gary, Indiana, you'd have to take the bus 17 miles down to Crown Point to vote every time you want to vote. And if you're indigent that's a significant burden, and - -",
  "Well, it's -- it's less of a burden, Your Honor, considerably less of a burden. You - -",
  "-- public transportation, because the person presumably has no access to an automobile because they don't have a driver's license and they're indigent and they're living in Gary, Indiana.",
  "That is not what the record shows, Your Honor, and it's not what the district court said. I think it's -- it would be really a travesty if this Court decided the case on that assumption. What the district court said is if you compare the voting age population in the census to the total number of driver's licenses and IDs that have been issued, you get that disparity of 43,000 or 1 percent, but what the district court went on to say is this is probably not accurate because the total of licenses and IDs includes all the people who have died and left the State and their licenses are still unexpired.",
  "No, no. The population - -",
  "So sorry.",
  "But she wasn't looking at the voting rolls. She was comparing population in the census as of 2005 with the driver's license records.",
  "No, I have no reason to -- it may have gotten better now. They apparently have instituted a lot of efforts in the last 3 years to make it better, but - -",
  "No, I was referring to actually cleaning up the voter rolls in compliance with the consent decree they signed with the United States.",
  "I suppose. I don't know if I can say significant. The situation has existed for now a number of years, and the salient fact here is that there's not a single recorded example of voter impersonation fraud.",
  "No, it's actually not, Your Honor. It's the type of fraud that the Elections Commission said -- found is unlikely, the most unlikely, because it's not that hard to detect. When you're going into the polls and saying, I'm Joe Smith, you're dealing with a neighborhood person who knows a lot of people who are there, you have to match that person's signature. And if that person shows up later on to vote - -",
  "Well, the duplicates, presumably, are in two different places, right. So they would vote in two different places. But if -- what the -- the fraudfeasor doesn't know is where the real John Smith is going to vote. So if he goes in and votes in one place and says, well, I'm going to -- I expect he's going to go in the other place, sooner or later, if you had any significant amount of this kind of fraud occurring, people would be coming in and saying I can't vote. Somebody says I already voted. It's not happening and, indeed, every single indication in this record is that the evidence of this kind of fraud occurring, to call it scant is to overstate it.",
  "No, Your Honor. I was talking about the disparity between the number of people in the voting-age population and the number of licenses and saying you can't assume it's only a one percent differential. It's actually more like an eight or nine percent differential.",
  "The question is - -",
  "It's certainly possible that someone could commit this kind of a crime.",
  "Well, one of the things that makes it less likely is if you try to actually affect an election you need to sway a lot of votes. And in order to do that this way you'd have to have 100 or 200 or 500 co-conspirators, each of them assigned an identity, learning the signature of that person, and - -",
  "Your Honor - -",
  "First of all, on the point of the anecdotes, I would encourage you to look at the Brennan Center brief.",
  "Well, Your Honor, many kinds of fraud do get caught, and they are no more easily detected than this kind of fraud to be detected. But this kind of fraud is not being caught. No one has been punished for this kind of fraud in living memory in this country. This is not - -",
  "Well, but Your Honor - -",
  "First of all -- first of all, you talk about deterring it. You deter it by the signature match, by having to have the same age, by having to get past people who know a lot of the people in the precinct, and by having very severe criminal penalties. And then you have - -",
  "What they recommended, Your Honor, is exactly what Justice Ginsburg anticipated, which is get everybody the cards, and then we'll be like Europe, and everything will work really fine, and it'll actually help the poor to have these IDs for a lot of other purposes.",
  "I would encourage the Court to refer to the Democratic Party Exhibit 18, which is an article by Carter, President Carter, and Secretary Baker, following on their report, saying, look, there's a problem here; that 12 percent of the voting age population of this country doesn't have a license; we did not recommend this being a mandatory thing until we get those licenses in those people's hands.",
  "Some States don't have signature matches. There may have been a minimal amount of additional benefit in some States from having that added. That was a decision they ultimately made, with some dissents. The reality, though, is if you do it not their way, but the Indiana way, which is to say you need an ID, we're not going to help you get it, in fact we're going to ratchet up the requirements for making you get it, and we're going to charge you money for it, then what you have is a very different system. Then you have --",
  "But what the record shows is that 60 percent of the time, when people go in and ask for one, they get sent home, because they don't have the right documentation because the rules - -",
  "Your Honor, I think they were very strong on having this birth certificate requirement, as well. So they -- they were talking about the real ID law and that sort of thing. So I'm not specific about what the report says on that, but they certainly thought there should be -- obviously, in the wake of 9/11 there is some concern about giving out these things too readily. So I'm reasonably sure they supported a birth certificate requirement as well.",
  "Well, it is a difficult area of the law for you for that reason, Justice Alito. But if you like at Timmons what it says is there's no litmus test, there's no escaping the hard judgments. This is the area where the courts have to be not too deferential even though there are hard judgment calls about matters of degree, because this is an area where the concern is that the Legislative Branch and the Executive Branch are going to abuse their power to regulate the electoral process to find subtle ways to skew the outcome on election day. As John Hard Ely says, this is an area where judicial review is the most important, the most legitimate. And so you can't shy away from that even though there are difficult matters of balancing involved and - -",
  "You are supposed to look at how difficult it is to get the ID, what assistance is provided or not being provided, how much it costs.",
  "The answer is that there's plenty of evidence in the record about the number of people in this country who don't have IDs.",
  "The best argument for Indiana is if you take the district court's 43,000 figure and you adjust it for the two factors, death and departure, that I mentioned before, the number becomes more like 400,000 people in the State of Indiana who lack IDs and are of voting age, eligible -- voting age population people.",
  "It is obviously for each person a different matter of degree. The burdens here are along a whole spectrum because some people don't have a birth certificate, some people have -- don't have a birth certificate, but they have money. Some people don't have a birth certificate and they don't have money.",
  "Well, because you -- you basically have to take into account all of those factors: How many people are potentially affected; how difficult it is; how similar it is to, say, a poll tax, for example, and say -- and then look at what purpose is being served here. Is there any real incremental benefit to anything by - -",
  "Right.",
  "Well, Your Honor, I would say of that 400,000 voting age people, probably about half of them are registered voters. It stands to reason that most of them are lower income people, and that therefore, the burden even of having to pay for the birth certificate is a significant one. That -- so that a very substantial portion of that 200,000 people in order - -",
  "I'm not aware of anything, Your Honor. This is a fairly new law at the time this record was being put together in 2005. But certainly, the parties - -",
  "But, you know, what there is in the record, Your Honor, is the testimony from the Lafayette Urban Ministry, which helps the needy in Lafayette, Indiana. They had 150 people come to them and say: We want your help to get IDs. A year later, less than 75 had succeeded because they found themselves caught in this Catch-22, where they went to get a birth certificate, they didn't have a driver's license, they didn't have the other kinds of very narrowly specified IDs they needed, and so they were basically in this bureaucratic maze, and they couldn't get out of it even with the kind of assistance you're imagining, Your Honor. If I might reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor. Let me start by addressing the question of what reasonable alternatives there are to the strict law that we are dealing with here. This is the most strict law in the country. And what you have when you look at the range of laws that are out there in other States is a very different set of responses that occur when a voter shows up without an ID in hand. In Michigan and several other States, for example, the response is to say: All right, we are going to make you fill out an affidavit attesting to who you are, and that you are a registered voter; that you live in this precinct; and we'll let you go ahead and vote a regular ballot. That in those States they -- they consider that a sufficient safeguard while looking at the IDs of all the people who have the IDs. In Florida they have a different approach, which is to let you vote a provisional ballot, and then what they do is they judge your signature match later on in exactly the same process that's used for absentee ballots. We have a lot of information in this record about why it's okay to have absentee ballots allowed without an ID in Indiana, and they say, well, we have these specialized committees that know how to do signature matches; and they are trained; and so we get thousands of these absentee ballots in. But we can very carefully scrutinize them. You could do very easily do exactly the same thing with respect to the provisional ballots cast by people who show up without their ID without - -",
  "Well, Your Honor - -",
  "Yes, there are; and it's this Court's job under the Burdick line of cases to weigh the benefits and the burdens and come out with the appropriate decision about whether the legislature went too hard -- far. Let me talk a little bit about this facial versus as-applied approach. To paraphrase King Lear: That way lies madness, Your Honor. This Court has never looked at these issues on an as-applied basis. The Burdick test, in its very nature, is about facial weighing of systemic benefits and burdens from the particular rule. And there is a reason for that, because the concern is systemic; that the burdens that are being imposed, a whole range of them depending on the kind of people involved and their particular circumstances, will have an effect on the outcome of the election overall. Imagine, if you will, what it would be like to try to have all these class actions being brought, some by the people who don't have IDs, some by the people who have IDs but don't have enough money. You would have to figure out exactly how much money people are allowed to have in order to be in this exempt class. The courts would then be creating exempt classes, trying to decide whether the legislature would have wanted an exemption drawn or not. The whole thing would be a complete and utter morass. And, ultimately, even if you did carve out an exception for indigent people or for some other group of people, you ultimately would leave untouched the real problem, which is the concern that even for people who are relatively - - suffer relatively minor inconvenience, maybe one percent of them are not going to show up and vote. And that's exactly what the legislature may have been trying to accomplish here. So that is not the way the jurisprudence in this area ever looks at it. Nobody applied the poll -- nobody challenged the poll tax as-applied.",
  "That it imposes a range of burdens on people from quite severe to less severe, and those burdens vastly outweigh the -- any incremental state interest that is being served, Your Honor. That's our -- our analysis, and I think it's certainly completely consistent with every decision right up through Klingman a couple of years ago. That's the test that this Court applies.",
  "Well, you have to make some judgment about the incremental, additional benefit above what's already been in place for decades, and it worked extremely effectively, Your Honor. And, obviously, you do the balancing. I'm just the advocate here. But it seems to me you have to say is there any real benefit here compared to these burdens?",
  "Well, Your Honor, I think the number of people who are adversely affected is part of the analysis. But if you come in and you come to the conclusion that there is essentially no real, significant benefit from making all of these other people who have IDs show them, then the balance comes out that you throw the law out. That's the way the analysis works.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is narrowed to a single, but from the Petitioner's perspective a critical, dispute over the scope of internal State sovereignty: whether the First Amendment trumps the otherwise existing authority of the Idaho legislature to direct political subdivisions of the State to take an action, here restricting access to their payroll systems, that the subdivisions could take independently without violating the Amendment. The genesis of this dispute is Idaho Code Section 44-2004(2), which was adopted in 2003. That provision prohibits State and local government public employers from deducting amounts for political activities from the payroll checks due to their employees and remitting those amounts to third parties.",
  "As construed by the district court, it did. The base legislation in this, the Voluntary Contribution Act, excluded from application an employee -- an employer subject to the two major labor -- Federal labor relations statutes, the NLRA and the RLA. But there was obviously a group of employers, private employers, in -- who were not engaged in commerce, as well as the agricultural sector.",
  "The district court concluded that the -- yes, Your Honor, we did.",
  "We do.",
  "Well, the principal difference is that one is a private employer -- that is to say, engaging in private speech -- while the public employer is a -- is a subdivision of the State of Idaho, subject, we would argue, to the plenary control, pursuant to the Idaho Constitution, of the Idaho legislature.",
  "Your Honor, in a word, the answer is no. I don't believe we, referring to the Petitioners in this case, could have written the -- the political subdivisions of a State to direct them to take an action unless there was a legislative basis for doing so. In this instance, the -- the legislature concluded that it wanted all public employers, among others, to not allow access to their payroll systems.",
  "Prior to the adoption of the statute in 2003, yes.",
  "Well, there is a fundamental difference, Your Honor. And -- and it rests in the notion that the State has no interest in the -- in private employers' determination to be involved or not involved in political matters. The State legislature, however, has a very concrete interest in avoiding either the reality or the appearance - -",
  "It might, Your Honor, but that situation, of course, is not the situation presented here.",
  "Because the statute at issue here, Justice Kennedy, speaks across the board to a specific kind of conduct, political activities. It does so in the a viewpoint-neutral fashion. To prohibit a particular parade might well raise viewpoint non-neutrality issues.",
  "Your Honor, they are incorrect about that. The district court concluded that the statute is viewpoint-neutral. Indeed - -",
  "The answer is no. It -- the - - the statute just -- does not just affect union speech by its literal terms.",
  "Well, there is no evidence in the record, Your Honor, as to any other entity who is affected by the statute. But that is hardly -- that's hardly remarkable, given the fact that the plaintiffs in the litigation are six labor organizations. I should add that - -",
  "There are, Your Honor.",
  "Well, to the extent that the - - the contribution was for political activities - -",
  "That's correct.",
  "Your Honor, again, it depends. I -- I don't know the answer.",
  "Your Honor, in fact, we argued below that there was no constitutional right of access to the payroll system for purposes of making political contributions. And let me reiterate at this - -",
  "Well, the -- I would suggest that a remand for that purpose would be futile. The district court, as I said before, concluded that the statute is viewpoint neutral. And let me stress that the term \"political activities\" does not -- is not defined with reference to unions or speech by other entities that might be controlled by unions. It addresses political contributions for electoral matters, independent expenditures, and expenditures to political parties.",
  "Yes, to the - -",
  "To the extent that the -- the organization is, for example, a political action committee, it would. And let me go back to Justice Ginsburg's question for a moment. Had the legislature intended 44-2004(2) to apply only to unions, they would have - - it would have been engaging in a redundancy because under another provision of the same legislation, 44-2603(1)(b)(iv), which appears at petition appendix 70, the Idaho legislature proscribed amounts being - - amounts -- required all amounts to be paid -- paid to a separate segregated fund which was established pursuant to the legislation that was invalidated by the district court, required those kinds of contributions to be made directly by the employee and not through -- or not by the employee's employer.",
  "No, Your Honor. The - - 44-2004(2) is part of the Idaho Right to Work Act, which was adopted in the mid 1980s. It allows amounts to be deducted through payroll checkoffs for union dues.",
  "That's -- that's correct. The - -",
  "True. But let -- let me -- let me continue with my response to Justice Scalia's question. The special prerogative that, for example, the Pocatello Education Association or the firefighters union has is the ability to engage in collective bargaining pursuant to State statute as the exclusive bargaining representative of, for example, the Pocatello School District's teachers. That exclusivity which is granted to a limited number of -- of -- in fact, two areas under Colorado -- excuse me -- under Idaho law, namely, firefighters and teachers, is the extraordinary benefit that unions have.",
  "Well, I would agree that -- that unions have, and particularly these -- particularly the Respondents have a special benefit. But again, I go back to the basic point that 2004(2) addresses all public employers or public employees and is not limited to political activity contributions. That might be, for example, as the situation is here, to a union-sponsored political action -- political action committee.",
  "Local governments have discretion.",
  "That's correct.",
  "With respect - -",
  "Well, it takes away that discretion with respect to any third party who might receive amounts for political activities.",
  "The reason, as we articulate in our brief, is the desire to avoid either the appearance or the reality of public employer involvement in, in this instance, electoral politics.",
  "Outside the area of elections, not with respect to payroll deductions.",
  "Your Honor, the -- the county - - counties in Idaho and I suppose in most States act as political subdivisions of the State. And whatever authority they have or don't have derives, if not exclusively, virtually exclusively from State law.",
  "Your Honor, let me go back to the election context for a moment to try to address that question. Prior to its amendments pursuant to the legislation at hand, Idaho Code Section 67-6605, which is part of Idaho's election campaign finance and reporting statute or general statutes, allowed payroll deductions to be made for contributions to political committees. In that sense, it allowed counties, as well as other public employers, to make deductions of the kind at issue today. Now, that authority was rescinded by virtue of the amendment to 2004(2). The point simply is that if necessary, we -- we could describe in detail various kinds of -- of requirements that exist with respect to counties or school districts or cities.",
  "Well, Your Honor, for example, with respect to -- take open meetings, for example, take public records, for example. Those are general kinds of statutes that impose requirements on all levels of State government. So, for example, with respect to open meetings, the Idaho law requires essentially all meetings, except for certain exclusions, to be open to the public. In that sense, it's akin to the Wisconsin statute.",
  "Your Honor, it does, but not - - not in connection with their public employment activities.",
  "It means that there is no prohibition under State law, for example, for a public employee to engage in political activity. If -- but our statute in Idaho applies actually only to State employees. It doesn't govern those kinds of activities by local government.",
  "It would be an acceptable proposition to the extent that Federal law doesn't pre-empt State law, Your Honor.",
  "In this instance, we would argue that the First Amendment does not interpose some kind of barrier to essentially vulcanize local government from State legislative control.",
  "Depending on -- on the facts, I -- I would agree that it is certainly possible for the State law to - -",
  "Well, but -- but, Your Honor, that is, I think, beyond cavil; that is to say that Federal law - -",
  "Beyond cavil, beyond - -",
  "Well, it -- it depends on - -",

  "It is beyond cavil if the Federal law, in fact, supersedes State law. There may be issues - -",
  "That's correct.",
  "I disagree, Justice Souter. The -- as I stated in response to Justice Stevens, the difference is a central one. That is to say, a corporation is a private entity with -- with distinct rights under the First Amendment.",
  "I disagree to the extent that there is any attempt to equate a private corporation with essentially an agent or an arm of the State such as a county, which has been delegated governmental functions.",
  "Well, that is -- certainly is the distinction between a private corporation and, for example, a county.",
  "And -- and the very nature of the entity, itself, Your Honor. A county - -",
  "A county or school district performs functions assigned to it by the State legislature to carry out the function, to carry out activities that are public in nature.",
  "That's correct.",
  "Your Honor, I -- I can only repeat that the distinction between the private corporation and the -- and a political subdivision of the State is that, in fact, one is an entity created by the legislature for the very purpose of carrying out State governmental functions. That -- that, I think, is entirely consistent with the position argued throughout this case.",
  "And Your Honor, I think I responded.",
  "Yes. States -- of course States do have that authority.",
  "Thank you.",
  "There is State funding, but the reason, I believe, why the Respondents -- excuse me the Petitioners -- have conceded that the subsidization case law does not apply to this statute in its application to the local governments, is that what the subsidization cases are talking about -- cases like Regan, Rust, Findley -- are situations where we'll say the State is involved in developing a program which it will pay for, and it says because we are paying for that, our priorities are to be honored. The government in this instance, it's been conceded, as the Court of Appeals pointed out, there is no actual subsidization to the payroll systems. In effect the State says we have some money we give to our local governments -- by no means, all revenue, but they get some money. But we -- the State does not set the kinds of budget priorities that are protected by the Regan line of cases. Specifically, the State in effect says that as far as payroll systems and in fact as far as most employment matters and most administrative matters are concerned, here's some money for you, local government. The only thing we say about it is don't use it for political payroll deductions.",
  "But the difference, Your Honor, in all of the other cases one could look at Regan and the like, there is a program where the government is involved in its manifold details. The government determines the purpose of the program; it has an overriding interest in the program; and it says in the course of that, in the course of dealing with this program, we don't want government money to be used for the following things. If you -- if that were extended to say that there will be essentially no First Amendment claim whenever the government says as to some program that it has no other involvement and that it has no other interest in, we don't want the following speech, and over here we don't have the following speech - -",
  "Two points that I think are critical. First, the concession with respect to the State government employees based on Regan it itself entails a concession as to the reasonableness and the due point neutrality of the statute. Two, Respondents' theory of government with respect to the legislature having to speak in some kind of specific term, we would suggest, ignores -- would ask this Court to create entirely new case law. But it also ignores in this situation the fact that the Idaho legislature contributes in 2006-2007 about half of the funds used by school districts in the State. And over 80 percent of those funds that go into what is known as a general maintenance and operations fund from which salary compensation is paid. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As the Court has alluded in a number of questions, both the district court and the Sixth Circuit now twice have resolved -- have rejected Cone's Brady claim on the merits, and we believe correctly so in light of Cone's actions in the day surrounding the murder, his statements about what he did and why he did it, and more importantly the lower court's recognition that additional evidence - -",

  "Your Honor, I certainly understand the Court's concern, and I'll just -- and again reiterate, there has not been any finding on that, but there is at least a suggestion in the record that some of the evidence on which the Petitioner is relying at this point actually wasn't suppressed. And we noted this in our brief, specifically as to the witness Ilene Blankman. All of the individual items on which the Petitioner is traveling now were the subject of cross-examination, so that at least raises the question about whether - -",
  "Well, Your Honor, I can't speak for the prosecutor's state of mind at the time, but I will -- will state that the central question in the case was not whether the Petitioner used drugs. There was evidence in the record from his mother, there was evidence in the record from his own mouth - -",
  "That's exactly right. It came through the State's own - -",
  "It came -- some of that came through the State's own witnesses. And -- and the argument the State made about him being a drug user versus a drug seller was not the only argument the State made. The State specifically said look at -- to the jury, look at what he did on the day of the murders, look at what he did on Saturday and Sunday to go to his state of mind. And the State focused on the -- the goal oriented, the purposeful behavior and the very direct behavior - -",
  "I don't think it would have been excluded. I think it could have been used to attempt to cross-examine certainly Agent Roby.

  "Well, I think -- yes, I think the defense ultimately would make the decision how to use the evidence that comes into his possession.

  "I think that -- that falls within that -- the prosecutor's judgment. But I think if we look -- look at the evidence in - -",
  "No, Your Honor.",
  "No, sir, I do not. There was already evidence before the jury that the defendant was a drug addict, that he was a drug user, that he was changed after Vietnam. This Court's own opinion in 2002 noted that he was a drug addict.",
  "I don't think that it would have been material to - -",
  "I think it added no more than - - than what was already before the jury.",
  "No, not under his theory, and the reason is - -",
  "Well, let me explain if I -- if I may, and the reason I say that it is not mitigating is because the -- the entire question in the defense and for mitigation purposes is the defendant's state of mind at the time of the murder. There was already evidence that there was - - that he was a drug user. The fact that he was a drug user doesn't say anything more -- or additional evidence of drug use says nothing more about his state of mind at the time of the crime than what was already presented. The question is not whether he was a drug user. The record showed it. It came out of the mouths of the State's own witness.",
  "I think that the prosecutor overstated in that portion of his argument, Your Honor.",
  "Well, I -- I want to answer your question, and I will answer your question, Your Honor, if I could just say one thing about the Brady. We don't dispute that the material in question is relevant to the defense and is relevant to the sentence. We dispute that it's material. We don't think it's material in every court where the district court and the sixth circuit have found it immaterial. But on the -- on the -- the -- what has happened in terms of the procedural defense, we have confessed that there was an error by the State in the -- in the post - conviction court. We agree that Tennessee law does allow -- it certainly at -- at this time did allow a petitioner to raise -- to -- to file successive petitions if that petitioner could establish cause. Now, the prosecutor in the course of responding to some 80 claims, both parts and subparts, made a mistake and read paragraph 35 as being similar to -- to a claim that had been raised on direct appeal and argued that it appeared to be the same. That was an error. Likewise, the trial court erroneously ruled that both paragraph 35 and paragraph 41, both Brady claims, had been previously determined on direct appeal or post-conviction. That was an error. We have confessed that in our brief and -- and do at this point. Now, in the appeal the petitioner doesn't again raise the Brady claim. In his principal brief he never mentions the Brady claim. He never even reaches - -",
  "In answer to your first question, yes, we don't disagree with the proposition that if a trial -- that if a State court refuses to consider a claim on the basis that that claim has been determined previously, that that would not be an adequate basis for a procedural default in Federal Court. But we don't -- I don't think that this case presents that scenario, and every court that has looked at the Court of Criminal Appeals's decision has read that decision as applying a waiver. The District Court read that decision as applying a waiver. If you look at -- at page 112-A of the petition appendix, not only does the District Court read it as a waiver, but the Petitioner read it as a applying a waiver. Because as you note in that first sentence, as to the Brady claim to the district court, Cone also attempts to argue that those claims were improperly held waived by the court.",
  "The trial court - -",
  "-- held that.",
  "I think that rule holds if the petitioner has made the argument to the appellate court. Here the Petitioner didn't make the argument to the appellate court.",
  "Well, I - -",
  "Well, first of all, Your Honor, I don't think the Petitioner has been getting the runaround. The Petitioner has always throughout this litigation proceeded on the premise that the CCA -- the Court of Criminal Appeals's decision in Tennessee was based on a waiver. All of his briefs in the lower court and in the -- the sixth circuit reflect that. The District Court proceeded as if that ruling was a waiver. The sixth circuit in its 2001 decision, if you look at page 62-A and 62 -- 63-A at the bottom, the -- the sixth circuit specifically said the Tennessee waiver rule is plainly applicable to the Brady claim. And the Tennessee courts explicitly relied on the waiver rule. It wasn't until the 2007 opinion that the - - the sixth circuit even discussed this notion of previous determination, and only then in response to what I think was a red herring injected by the dissenting opinion that somehow the -- the Court of Criminal Appeals's decision stood for something different than what the parties and the courts had been reading it all along. The Court of Criminal Appeals - -",
  "The State - -",
  "No, Your Honor. The State has consistently maintained throughout the habeas that the -- that the Brady claim was either defaulted or waived. In the answer to the petition, the State presented the very argument that they're presenting today, that the Court of Criminal Appeals relied on a waiver. In the - - in the brief to the Sixth Circuit - -",
  "Well, I think to understand how this -- how this could happen, the bottom line is that he failed to demonstrate to the State courts why he should -- he was properly before the court to begin with; and when you -- when you raise a claim -- he buried his claim among a hundred other parts and subparts. If --if he had a legitimate claim, he certainly didn't highlight it as such, and then he -- he buried even further his explanation for a waiver in a 41-page affidavit filed six days before the State court's ruling in this case. It was the first time in the entire case that he mentioned anything at all about access to the prosecutor's files. Then when he got an adverse judgment in the trial court he never even made the argument in the Court of Criminal Appeals. He took a completely different theory about waiver, said that waiver was personal, and should be -- should be judged on a subjective standard rather than objective -- never mentioned to the Court of Criminal Appeals any argument whatsoever about access to the prosecutor's files. It was on the basis of that argument that the Court of Criminal Appeals held that the Petitioner had failed to rebut the presumption of waiver as a matter of law as to all claims that had not been previously determined. So that holding is an overarching holding, it applies to every claim that was raised in the first term and in the successive habeas position, and we think justified the district -- it certainly was the basis of the district court's default and as well, in 2001 was the basis of the Sixth Circuit's decision. Now, regarding the 2007 decision, we concede that that decision could be read as presenting the question 1, where this Court relies on a finding of previous determination, but we don't think that's what the court did in 2007. In 2007 the court specifically ruled that it was not revisiting the Brady claim. That was a decision based on law of the case principles, and to the extent that it discussed previous determination, we don't think it in any way intended to modify its earlier holding. In 2001 the Sixth Circuit clearly relied on the waiver bar, and that's very evident on pages 62 and 63a in the petition appendix, and that's the basis of the waiver. So we don't even think that the -- that the situation in question 1 is even presented, although if -- to answer a question, in response to Justice Alito's question, I think it would be -- would be an absurd result that something that has been previously determined is defaulted, but that's not the situation here. The record shows it's not previously determined. The Petitioner has never argued that it's previously determined, and no court until this point has ever even read the Court of Criminal Appeals decision as making a previous determination finding. Everyone has accepted the fact that that holding was a waiver holding. So on that -- that's the basis of the default, and the reason that he has defaulted is that he failed to make that argument when he had -- when he the opportunity to make it. He could have made it, and he didn't make it. He buried all his good arguments, even on his waiver argument, he was making inconsistent arguments. On the one hand, he was saying the claim was novel, the claim that my post-conviction counsel didn't discuss it with me. On the other hand, he says that I'm just now finding out about it. Those are completely inconsistent theories, and the theory that he actually presented in the Court of Criminal Appeals bears no resemblance to the argument that he is making now or that he made in the district court. But all of this aside, it really is -- is beside the point because at the end of the day, the district court very clearly addressed -- and specifically, not just in passing, but specifically at various points in its -- in its opinion, the materiality of each and every item of evidence. He went through in detail a discussion of the police teletypes, stating that -- that the jury already was aware that he was a drug user. It really wasn't any question whether he was a drug user; the evidence clearly showed that he was. The question was what was his State of mind at the time evidence was what was his state of mind at the time of the murders.",
  "Well, I think if you look at the -- at the district court's opinion, I could that argument could be made based upon the way the district court treated the items. The district court certainly did look at them in categories and separated them; but I think if you look at the Sixth Circuit's opinion, certainly in 2007 where the court -- the court looked at it in more detail, I think that it is clear that the court cumulated the items and said as a whole that the Brady materials don't undermine -- do not undermine confidence in the verdict. So I disagree that -- that the Sixth Circuit treated them incorrectly, and -- and I would note - -",
  "Your Honor, I -- I think I've noted earlier, I think that the prosecutor overstated his case on that point, no question about it; but I think there was ample evidence in the record indicating that he was a drug user. This Court even noted that, even noted there was proof of the fact that he was a drug addict, that he was a drug user, that the evidence was strong that he was -- that he was under the influence of an amphetamine psychosis. There were two experts that testified to that. On the other hand, there were two experts for the State that said that that -- that defense couldn't be supported. So the question of whether he was a drug user or not a drug user was really beside the point. I think the prosecutor eventually got around to that in his argument. When you look at the argument of the whole, the bottom line of the argument was, and we quoted it in our brief, \"look at what he did, look at his actions around this murder, and let that go to his state of mind,\" because that was the best evidence. Not only is that -- he said, he specifically said he went into this individual's home with the purpose of getting fed, getting cleaned up and getting out of town, and when the Todds ceased to cooperate with him, he had to control them physically. That's code I suppose for beating them to death because that's exactly what he did. He explained what he did and why he did it. His actions are very calculated from -- from beginning to end. So whether he used drugs or didn't use drugs, the question is what was going on at the time of this murder, and by his own admission the reason that the Todds are -- are not with us today is because they ceased to cooperate; they became frightened; and he had to control them physically. I think that's the best evidence of his state of mind at the time. Those are words out of his own mouth, and I think that that certainly supports the finding of both the district court and the Sixth Circuit on materiality. I agree with the Chief Justice's assessment; we do not think that the Brady claim is fairly included within the question. The merits issue is not a predicate to the default question. I certainly understand Petitioner's dilemma in this case, but I think faced with that dilemma, he should have squarely presented that question among the questions presented and not dropped it in a footnote in argument 2. We don't think it's fairly presented; but -- but in any event, it certainly justifies affirmance of the judgment or at a minimum the dismissal of the appeal. And for all these reasons, if there are no further questions, we ask this Court to affirm the judgment of the district court -- of the Sixth Circuit.",
  "I don't know. I'm not aware that he's in any sort of heightened level of security. I would assume he's just at a standard level. I don't know his security level, but he has been on death row for the entire period, Your Honor.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The California law at issue restricts the distribution of expressive works based on their content. California, as we've heard today, does not seriously contend that it can satisfy the usual First Amendment standards that apply to such a law. Instead, it's asking this Court to grant it a new free pass, a brand-new Ginsberg-like exception to the First Amendment that would deny constitutional protection to some ill-defined subset of expressive works and, I submit, not just video games, but necessarily movies, books, and any other expressive work that describes or portrays violence in a way that some court somewhere, some day, would decide is deviant and offensive.",

  "Well, two aspects. With respect to parental controls, Your Honor, there's a whole variety -- a whole series of things that parents have available to them and are using today to deal with any concerns that they have about what's appropriate for their children.",
  "That is one element of about five different elements, Your Honor. And if I could talk about them -- there is the ratings. Parents are doing the purchasing 90 percent of the time. Even if the child does the purchasing, they bring the game home, the parent can review it. The game is being played in the home on the family television or computer most of the time. Any harm that's supposed to be inflicted on them is supposed to take place over a period of years, not minutes, so the parent has ample opportunity to exercise parental supervision over what games are being played in the house. Plus there is the parental controls, which are very similar to the ones that the Court has found to be significant in the Playboy case, in the COPA case, in a whole variety of cases.",
  "They cost in the range of $50 to $60 when new, Your Honor.",

  "Well, there's -- there's various aspects of this that I think it's important to understand.

The question before this Court is whether you're going to create an entirely new exception under the First Amendment, whether parents need to have such a new exception created, and whether or not, if you're going to do it, you could possibly figure out what the scope of that exception is.",
  "My position is that most people would think that that's an inappropriate game for minors -- we do not try to sell it to minors -- but that the Constitution should not be -­",
  "My position -­",

It's a licensing authority that the First Amendment doesn't allow.",

  "No, they don't.",
  "Well, I guess I can imagine a world in which expression could transform 75 percent of the people who experience it into murderers. That's clearly not the way the human mind works. And here the reality is quite the opposite. Dr. Anderson testified in the Illinois trial, which is in the record, that the vast majority of people playing the games will grow up and be just fine. And, in fact, he -- he acknowledged that the effects of these games are not one whit different from watching cartoons on television or reading violent passages in the Bible or looking at a picture of a gun.",
  "Your Honor, my main ground today is exactly that, that this Court said last year in United States v. Stevens it doesn't have a freewheeling authority to create new exceptions to the First Amendment after 200 years based on a cost-benefit analysis, and this is -- this is a test of that. This is exactly what the State of California is asking you to do.",
  "We do have a new medium here, Your Honor, but we have a history in this country of new mediums coming along and people vastly overreacting to them, thinking the sky is falling, our children are all going to be turned into criminals. It started with the crime novels of the late 19th century, which produced this raft of legislation which was never enforced. It started with comic books and movies in the 1950s. There were hearings across the street in the 1950s where social scientists came in and intoned to the Senate that half the juvenile delinquency in this country was being caused by reading comic books, and there was enormous pressure on the industry. They censored -- they self-censored. We have television. We have rock lyrics. We have the Internet.",
  "The games that we are talking about have narrative, events that are occurring, characters, plot. And that's exactly what the State has set out to regulate here.

  "Well, they make a feint at trying to argue that -­",
  "There you go. Your Honor, I think if you apply strict scrutiny here, they do not come close to the kind of showing that would be required under -- under the First Amendment. First of all, they have not shown any problem, let alone a compelling problem, requiring regulation here in a world where parents are fully empowered already to make these calls, where crime, including violent crime, since the introduction of these games, has been plummeting in this country, down 50 percent since the day Doom first went on the market 15 years ago; in a world where parents are fully aware of what's going on in their homes and aware of the ratings system and can use all the other tools that we have talked about -­",
  "Well, Your Honor, because obscenity doesn't have strict scrutiny applied to it, if it did, I expect you could make the same arguments, if there were -­",
  "Well, because, first of all, we don't have the same history of it. There's no historical pedigree of that kind of an exception. And, as I was suggesting earlier, there's a fundamental difference factually, which is Ginsberg works tolerably well because we take everything that's sexually explicit and appeals to a prurient interest, and we say over here, it's not appropriate for minors. Violence would require you to draw a much different line between acceptable protected violence and unacceptable unprotected violence for minors, and that given the lack of historical pedigree but also just given the nature of what you're trying to do -­",

  "And if you take the Miller standards and you take two things out of it -- you take out of it explicit sex and nudity, and you take out an appeal to prurient interest -- what do you have left? You have left -- what you have is a structure with no apparent meaning. There is no way to know how a court would apply a standard like deviant violence, morbid violence, offensive violence, let alone decide which video games have a redeeming social, political, artistic value. The value of a video game is completely in the eye of the beholder. Some would say they're beautiful works of artistic creation; others would say -­",
  "Except that you know -- we know, we all know, at least with respect to Ginsberg -- adult obscenity, I would acknowledge, is a very difficult line. Adult -- Ginsberg works reasonably well, because if it has sex in it and naked people having sex in it and it's designed to be appealing to people's prurient interests, you don't give it to minors. And you don't have a lot of cases out there about that.",
  "Correct, Your Honor.",
  "Let me -- I think a little history is helpful here. This Court has twice dealt with laws attempting to regulate violent works in the past. One was in Winters v. New York, where law applied to magazines and books, and one was in the 1960s. On the very day Ginsberg came down, in the Interstate Circuit case, the City of Dallas had an ordinance where there was going to be a commission that was going to review each movie and decide if it was appropriate for children.",

There's simply no evidence of that at all.",

  "Well, surely the record doesn't support it. The record says that if -- even if you take the studies at face value, it's not one whit more harmful than watching television cartoons. That's what the record shows.",
  "What they did was they spent several years trying to come up with a definition that would allow anybody to figure out which violent TV shows have to be put into this adult category and which don't, and they eventually punted and said we have no idea how to do that; Congress asked us to do it; we cannot do it; and they punted it back to Congress to try to come up with a definition. This is a very difficult task, trying to use language to differentiate levels of violence or types of violence in a manner that would in some way tell people what the rules of the game are. I think, even if you think that there's some problem out there that needs to be solved, you ought to think very carefully about whether or not you're going to authorize the creation of some new rule authorizing regulation in this area, when no one will have any idea what the scope of it is.",
  "I guess, if what we're really going to do is judge the constitutionality of this law based on what 16- and 17-year-olds are getting and whether that would be harmful to them, I think the problem there is the line between 16 and 17 and 18 is so fine, that you're not going to be able to identify any real category of games that fits into that category. And it's important, by the way, to -- to note that California hasn't told us whether we should judge it for 5-year-olds, 10-year-olds, 17-year-olds. If it's 5-year-olds, then it's vastly over-restrictive; if it's 17-year-olds, I suspect -- I suspect it wouldn't restrict anything because nobody is going to be able to convince a -- jury, well, this is an 18-year-old game, not a 17-year-old game.",
  "You do draw that line, Your Honor.",
  "But here you're assessing works of expression and trying to decide what age they -- they would correspond to, and I don't think you can cut it that finely and say, well, this is an 18 game; this is only a 17 game. I just don't think that works. So if that's the test, the test Justice Breyer suggested it ought to be, then the statute essentially would restrict nothing. If the test is 5-year-olds -­",
  "Well, first of all -­",
  "I think the \"maybe\" is telling, though, Your Honor.

There's a $1,000 a game penalty if you have the wrong -­",
  "Our rules wouldn't help you at all. They say that -- that -- they're only restricting a smaller number, a small subset of M-rated games, which, by the way, we say are appropriate for 17-year-olds. So you have -- these ratings that the State wants us to impose are going to conflict with the ratings that are already on the packaging which are being used by parents every day to make these judgments. So it's actually interfering -- the prospect of it would interfere with the information already on the packaging. Thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In order to be pre-empted here, the State provisions have to be -- excuse me -- the State law provisions have to be within the scope of the Act and with respect to the premises, facilities, and operations. None of the State provisions are within the scope, and some are not even operations.",
  "The scope are the -- the mandates of Federal law dealing with the method, quality, and marketing of turning animals into meat for human consumption.",
  "None of the provisions are within the scope because California is not regulating animals that are going to be turned into meat. And the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the purpose of the Act, the legislative history of the Act, show that the scope of the Act is concerned with animals that are going to become meat.",
  "That is correct. But the entire purpose of the Act is to inspect and examine animals to determine whether or not their meat will be wholesome and unadulterated.",
  "The humane treatment of the animals deals with animals in the connection of slaughter or while being slaughtered. And the animals that California is regulating, the nonambulatory animals that we're withdrawing from the process, will not be slaughtered, will not be turned into meat. Even the - -",
  "Well, the language of the regulations -- of the Federal regulations dealing with U.S. condemned animals, for instance, say that U.S. condemned animals shall be killed and shall not be slaughtered and dressed in the same facility with animals that will be turned into meat. So, even in the regulations there's a distinction between animals that will be slaughtered for meat and that will be edible and ones that are -- are condemned and will be killed.",
  "It applies to -- well, specifically the provisions in the Federal Meat Inspection Act apply to the animals that are going to be turned into meat. To the extent they apply to other animals or all animals as has been referenced, they would be pursuant -- those provisions would be pursuant to the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act, which is -- does not have a pre-emption clause and does not - -",
  "Correct.",
  "It applies to the humane provisions with animals -- with respect to the animals in connection with slaughter and that will be slaughtered, with respect to the Federal Meat Inspection Act. Because the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act was not incorporated into the Federal Meat Inspection Act, it does not have an express pre-emption clause, and there's no language in the text of that Act, the Humane Methods Act, or in the legislative history showing that it was an attempt to federalize animal cruelty law, for instance. So, the idea that - -",
  "Correct. 603 and 610 of the Federal Meat Inspection Act reference the Humane Methods Act and reference that that is to be applied when the animals are in the -- being processed in the connection with slaughter and being slaughtered. So, again, it is -- it is limited to the animals that -- that are going to become meat under the Federal Meat Inspection Act.",
  "Our rules -- well, the ante - mortem inspection and post-mortem inspection are required of animals that are going to be turned into meat, correct. And our -- the California law does not touch on post-mortem inspection at all. And only in the case -- excuse me. And the -- as far as - -",
  "No, because when an animal becomes nonambulatory, it is readily apparent. That's a characteristic that is readily apparent. And in -- at least in California, when the animal becomes nonambulatory, the requirement would be to immediately euthanize the animal because it's not part of the meat supply system.",
  "It commands an action, but it's not within the scope of the Act because at the very outset California is saying that these animals are not to be part of the meat supply system in California.",
  "They may be part of the meat supply system, but it's not required. It's not - - nonambulatory animals are not - -",
  "Certainly, Your Honor. The euthanization is an operation of the slaughterhouse. But it's -- but this -- California's provision is not within the scope. And pursuant to 678, to be expressly pre-empted, it has to be within the scope and with respect to operations. So, with respect to that provision, the euthanization provision, we concede that it is -- it is part of the operations. But it is not within the scope because we're dealing with an animal that California has deemed as not part -- as -- excuse me - -",
  "The distinction I would make, Your Honor, is that the purpose of the ante-mortem inspection is to determine if the -- if the animal's meat will be wholesome and unadulterated. To the extent that the pre-inspection or the inspection also finds diseases that can be passed on to other animals or -- or to the rest of the herd, that's -- that's certainly a benefit, but it's not part of the purpose of the Federal Meat Inspection Act.",
  "Two points. One, the diseases that were referenced by the amicus dealing with this are diseases that will be passed to the animals, not to humans. And the second point is that the -- the purpose, again, of the Act as specified in 602 is to make sure that the meat of the animal is wholesome and unadulterated. And the ante-mortem inspection will occur for every animal that goes into the meat supply system. So, if California withdraws a nonambulatory animal, it doesn't receive the ante-mortem inspection, it's not going into the meat supply system. But all of the other animals in that pen that are ambulatory, pursuant to the Federal law, will receive that ante-mortem inspection and will, by the inspector or the veterinarian, be declared disease free or not. So, they will find -- they will be able to find those diseases in the ambulatory animals and the ones that are going into the meat supply system.",
  "Your Honor, if your question is, would that be pre-empted if California excluded pursuant to other diseases, it would not be expressly pre-empted. So, California can make decisions on categories of animals, here nonambulatory swine, and the -- it would not be expressly pre-empted. There may be questions about conflict pre-emption, but in this particular case, conflict pre-emption was litigated in the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit found that there was no conflict pre-emption.",

And we do dispute the -- the factual assertion that's been made that all purchasing happens on the -- on the slaughterhouse grounds. There's no -- no factual record of that in the -- in the lower record. We have no way to dispute that because it was not -- it was not litigated.",
  "We believe the -- the law could be or would be severable. In the Ninth Circuit, the preliminary injunction went to all provisions except for subparagraph (e). We would have to litigate severability, of course, but we do think that it would be severable, and it seems that the Ninth Circuit - -",

So, it is trying to deal with a comprehensive problem that it sees with respect to nonambulatory animals, not just at the slaughterhouse but at other market agencies, et cetera -- and livestock agencies. And so -- so, the focus on purchasing, buying, receipt, selling of the meat is to prohibit and -- and stop the -- the commerce in nonambulatory animals. And California's purpose there, as I said, was twofold, to, one, protect general public health but also to prohibit animal cruelty in an area where - - where California legislators were concerned about the humane treatment of nonambulatory animals, not just swine, because the law is broader than that, but that's what's at issue here today.",

  "Thank you, Your Honor.

  "Chief Justice Roberts, may it please the Court: This case is a classic jury question. There are, contrary to the Petitioners' and amicus position, several genuine material issues of fact that are absolutely in dispute, and I would like to recite a few of those to set the preface to respond to some of the questions that have already been raised. We start with the fact that there was no chase at the time that these shots were fired. The chase had stopped. This situation was a controlled environment, not perfectly controlled, but ­­",

  "And that issue has not been asked at the district court. It has never been raised by the Petitioners in this case that they should be treated separately. The Sixth Circuit ­­ the Sixth Circuit recognized that in the footnote. And that is an issue that should be presented to the district court, I would submit. But if we separate ­­",
  "Okay. That's the first point of what was wrong, is that there was no danger at that point to the officers, and the only, the only excuse or justification that the officers could utilize at that time, because they were shot as the car was driving away and going down the street, the danger at that point that is being created by shooting is to the general public.",
  "The first part of your question brings in the first sequence when Officer Plumhoff shoots the first three shots, and you reference, Justice Alito, the statement that he is trying to get him to get out of the car, show his hands, etcetera. The video shows that that could not have happened. Officer Plumhoff gets out of his car drawing his weapon and goes to the car and immediately shoots. No delay, period. He immediately begins to shoot.",
  "That ­­",
  "You can't tell because he is up ­­ he is bumper to bumper with the Gardner car. It is true that the wheels spin forward.",
  "Well, we don't know. He wasn't given the opportunity. What we do know is this: There is evidence in this record from which a reasonable jury could conclude that he may have been trying to give up, because Officer Forthman, who was the one that struck him and spun him out, says that once he turned onto Jackson Avenue he hit his brakes hard. Now, he didn't hit his brakes hard in order to get away from him. And at that point, Officer Forthman says that caused him to hit him and spin him out. And at that point, the momentum of his car caused the light contact between he and Plumhoff, who was moving toward him, as well.",
  "Yes.",
  "No, no, no. He is well off the interstate.

If I can get back now to ­­ to the material genuine issues of fact that are in dispute, keep in mind, Officer Plumhoff, who shot those first three shots, did not do it to prevent the car from leaving again. He said the only reason that he fired those three shots was because he was standing directly in front of the path of that car and he thought he was going to be killed; and the video 100 percent shows that that is not true.",
  "It is an objective question.",
  "He has to have some justification of danger under objective reasonableness to make the decision to use deadly force. And he says that it was because he was standing in the path of the car. He wasn't. That car was bumper to bumper against the Gardner car.",
  "I believe it would not be.",
  "No. I'd respectfully submit, Justice Alito, that it would not because if that's all there was, there were other alternate methods to stop that car from leaving. It wasn't the reason that he did it; but if you assume that you can analyze it on that basis, there were several alternate ways to prevent that car from leaving.",

And remember this: Before Officer Plumhoff gets to that car, Officer Evans is already there. He didn't see the danger. He's got his gun pulled; he has hit it against the windshield; and he didn't see the need to shoot and he had an opportunity before Officer Plumhoff did, and he never shot.",

But when you see that video, those 12 shots are fired, one, after he has been shot three times, but also they were fired where the ballistic circumstance could bring the bullets to civilians, residents.

  "It ­­ it ­­ the question is different than that, Chief Justice Roberts.

And it should have been a factor in the reasonable officer's judgment about whether or not to initiate deadly force.",
  "There is no case that says specifically if there is a passenger there don't use a weapon. But virtually every case talks about the ­­ the impact of using lethal force to do it or not to do it when relative to innocents, third parties.

  "Or, Chief Justice Roberts, a greater danger by a car driving down the road with a dead driver behind the wheel, totally out of control, and that almost happened in this case, as you see in the video. There was an oncoming car just before he veered off to the left and hit that house.",

Closely tracks any number of other cases, including from their own circuit, McCaslin, which held that qualified immunity did not apply in a situation where the officer felt they why justified in shooting to avoid another escape. And those are the policies and procedures that are applicable of the state of knowledge of these officers when we look at clearly established law and all of those authorities which support the fact that qualified immunity should not attach in this case under these circumstances.",
  "I don't quarrel with that except to the extent, in this case, in that second sequence, you're endangering other people other than the person that you're trying to stop. That's ­­ that's the distinction. Before my time is through, I do want to go back to the jurisdictional question, because in the end in this case, the interlocutory was taking nothing more than a challenge to the evidentiary sufficiency, the facts necessary to consider both prongs.

  "Sorry.",

  "I would say two things, Your Honor. First of all, it's a tiny role in this case. But second of all, even if it were the only reason why you had a ­­ population deviations under 10 percent, I think it would be not defensible for this Court to say that, by itself, is unconstitutional. There is so ­­ de minimis effect on any interest in terms of representation from this difference of population, absent some bias in the way that the districts elect candidates, that it's simply not a constitutional problem that you ought to recognize where the ­­ even if the pure motive was ­­ was partisanship, it's simply not something that ought to be taken seriously as a constitutional problem. But here, where the predominant motive is to try to make sure these districts will pass preclearance, and less than 50 ­­ 50 percent of the commissioners may have had, for one district, where they increased the deviation slightly, like .2 percent, may have had some partisanship as well as the Voting Rights Act in mind for District 8. Not one of the ten that were offered to the Justice Department as ability­to­elect districts. That's a tiny, tiny, tiny sliver of partisanship for less than the full commission. It was never ­­",
  "I think if ­­ if that's the only thing that they ­­ that ­­ that was problematic about the map, you might well say that's constitutional. But that's ­­ that's not this case, obviously.",
  "And it ­­ it ­­ you know, you've gone as far as Larios. You've said a map that's an ­­ an egregious gerrymander, massive disparate pairing of incumbents, plus the not ­­ intentional abuse of the 10 percent rule at 9.98 percent, all of that together, you summarily affirmed a finding of unconstitutionality. But by itself, I don't know that I would even say that ­­",
  "Yes, Your Honor.",
  "But this Court has said, over and over again, we want to give States leeway in this area, because representation is often better if you give them some chance to make districts within the 10 percent band. And if you allow them to do what's ­­ what's being suggested here, to accuse ­­ to bring partisanship in and they can get to Federal court and they can get to trial just by that, then exactly what you said is going to happen in ­­ in your dissent in Larios. Every ­­ everybody with a ­­ with a political motivation to try to do something to undercut a map is going to come in. It's easy enough to ­­ to allege partisanship. Here the ­­ all ­­ the only evidence they have of partisanship, leaving aside the little story of District 8, is simply the pattern, that the Hispanic districts they under­populated and the Native American district happened to vote Democratic. So you have this pattern. The chart on ­­ they point to on page 112a, but that's not evidence. It's equally consistent with what the court found happened, which is they wanted to make these districts more persuasive as ability­to­elect districts so they could get preclearance. And voila, they got preclearance. This is a ­­ this is a case where you wonder: Where's the beef? What exactly are we here for? There's no problem with this map. It's not a partisan gerrymander. It's not a racial gerrymander. It's within the 10 percent boundary. They ­­ they did everything in open. Everything that ­­ that's being complained about here, all of this under­population of these districts that was done at the ­­ was done unanimously by all five commissioners who adopted the goal of getting preclearance, who adopted the ­­ the ­­ the idea that they had to get 10 districts, not eight districts, that every single change to those 10 districts that increased their under­population was unanimously voted by all five commissioners. This is a case where there is simply nothing seriously being argued here that could possibly amount to a constitutional violation. And it seems to me that we can talk about whether a pure partisan case ought to, by itself, if the only ­­ if the only problem is deviation, to be unconstitutional, I would recommend that you not do that for the reasons you said in your dissent in Larios. But, boy, this ­­ this case is so far from that. I mean, the Republican commissioner ­­ appointed commissioners are voting for everything that they're complaining about because they, too, want to get preclearance. The State of Arizona wants very much to have its map go into effect for the first time since the 1960s when it became covered by the Voting Rights Act, rather than having a Federal court have to put the map into effect because preclearance was denied. And they ­­ they hire lawyers who worked in the Justice Department, told them how many districts they needed, told them that if necessary in rejiggering these lines, they could go down ­­ up to the 10 percent limit. They then tried very hard to minimize that. And one of the things that's important to recognize here is you could have probably equalized the population here and still gotten districts to the same level of Hispanic population, but you would have had to draw tentacles of the kind that the Court has many times criticized. There's lots and lots of other Hispanic people in the State of Arizona who are not in these districts, but that's because they're spread out all over the place. And so if you're going to draw compact districts, if you're going to draw districts that respect county boundaries, if you're going ­­ and census tracts and communities of interests, something has to give. And what gave here was this modest, tiny, small amount of population variation that seems to me just not a serious candidate for any kind of constitutional invalidation on the facts of this case, which aren't even challenged here, is clearly erroneous. If the Court has no further questions, thank you.",
  "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For over a century, the following three things have been true in the disputed area. First, the non­Indian population has always been greater than 98 percent. Second, the Tribe never exercised jurisdiction. And third, by contrast, the State of Nebraska has governed the disputed area. The story of the disputed area is that of a land that long ago lost its Indian character, if it ever had any. The three things I mentioned at the outset happened for a reason. They happened because it was the ­­ or the intent of Congress in the context of the times of the 1882 Act that the disputed area would be diminished from the reservation.",

  "Your Honor, we think the de facto diminishment does fit within the third element of the Solem test, which is the subsequent circumstances of ­­ of after the enactment.

  "It ­­",

Your ­­ we'd be introducing an additional sovereign, the Tribe, into an area which, for over 130 years, the Tribe has not exercised any sovereign authority at all.",
  "The Court's precedent, I believe, recognizes in the area of land surplus acts that Indian land surplus acts are a unique animal from your normal legislative analysis. And that would be because in the context of the times back before the turn of, I guess, two centuries ago in the 1800s, Congress would be doing land surplus acts in which the concept of are we diminishing or not diminishing a reservation was really nothing that Congress thought of. You put that on the basic principle that only Congress can diminish a reservation, it then becomes the problem of how do we determine what Congress intended when, frankly, the reality of the Court's precedent is, it's something that Court ­­ or Congress generally did not think of. They were inconsistent. And so the Solem test really evolves out of an attempt to determine what was the intent of Congress at the time, which then is why legislative history, subsequent or ­­ subsequent circumstances takes on greater significance.",
  "Well, it becomes ­­ it becomes a big question when the issue is is it part of the reservation ­­",
  "It becomes a big issue when the issue is who ­­ frankly, who has authority to govern? Is this still part of the reservation or not? Does the Tribe have any authority over this area at all?

  "Well, what it can do, it can displace State jurisdiction over environmental regulations that this is a rural farming area. The environment is very important. State regulation is very important.

  "Yes. The Tribe absolutely exercises authority in the part that's not part of the reservation.

So they have had no presence, and they've acknowledged that. They have no Tribal offices, schools, industries, businesses. They've admitted that all of these governmental services are provided by state and local agencies, not the Tribe. That's the public expectation. That's what they expect is ­­",
  "In the western part.",
  "I'm sorry if I wasn't clear. In our ­­ in the eastern part, the Tribe does have its ordinances. It does provide services.

This comes in ­­ we come in; we're going to tax you; we're going to take the money; and maybe you get services, maybe you don't.

They don't get to remove them from office ­­",
  "Appreciate that, Your Honor. And ­­ and yes, the standard diminishment test starts with looking at the Act. Is there language in the Act? Hagen and Solem both specifically say no particular form of words are required. What we do have in this Act is we've got two areas of the reservation. The area west of the reservation, it's a very well­defined area. It doesn't create a checkerboard effect. What is significant is the different ­­ the Act treats the area west of the railroad different than the area east of the railroad. Specifically ­­ and this is a major distinction in Solem ­­ there is nothing reserved for the Tribe in the land on the west of the railroad, the disputed area. There's nothing reserved for ­­ in the bullpen, so to speak. There is no reservation of land­use rights. There's no reservation of land­use rights for schools, agency, Tribal religious purposes, no reservation in mineral rights. In Solem those were considered significant factors because what you end up with is that the Tribal headquarters, its governmental headquarters ended up in Solem being in the disputed area.",
  "Well, City of Sherrill, it does have the element of the Tribe trying to unilaterally just ­­",
  "It ­­ well, it says the Tribe doesn't have sovereignty just to buy land back and get back sovereignty that it had long ago lost ­­",
  "­­ and it applies equitable principles to say you're ­­",
  "Yes. Yes. And I ­­ and I think it's perfectly reasonable for the Court to reach that conclusion with a land which long ago it lost its Indian character, long ago they've ­­ they've never exercised any sovereignty, and then show up after the public, the descendants, everyone who's lived there, and after 130 years you suddenly find out we ­­ we've got an Indian Tribe that somehow has some governmental authority over us. We've never elected them; we don't have any right to vote them out of office. If we don't like what we're going to do, I guess we can complain to somebody, but we can't recall members of the Tribal Council. It's ­­ it is a recognition that those things happened because that's what Congress intended to have happen, and as Solem looks in the context of the times. As far as that legislative history or what ­­ what happened afterwards, Solem emphasizes the decades immediately after the Act. And in the decades immediately after this Act, we don't have what Solem talks about, the rife with inconsistencies. What we have is a total, one hundred percent consistent record that everyone understood. This land was diminished. It's not part of the reservation.

Mr. Chief Justice, if ­­ if I may reserve the remainder of my time if there's no further questions.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor. Where do I start? Let's start first with ­­ pointed out to me by co­counsel that a misstatement I made in response to Justice Kagan. The Eighth Circuit briefs do cite Sherrill in support of the proposition for de facto diminishment. My apology. I hadn't argued at that point, but it is there in the Eighth Circuit. I would cite to the Joint Appendixes so the Court is aware exactly where it can find that undisputed, as far as the demographics, the jurisdictional history, JA 215 to JA 216, JA 318 to JA 319, JA 609 to JA 611. The ­­ the concept that, gee, nothing really big's going to change, having the Tribal police show up in their police vehicles patrolling the streets because it's on Tribal land is going to be a huge disruption of expectations. My background is in criminal law.

You have a lot of who­done­its in which the question is who's supposed to investigate, and you have this overlapping jurisdiction where law enforcement itself is confused as to who's supposed to be investigating when they don't even know, maybe, who the perpetrator is. The idea that a Tribal member of a State governmental authority is somehow shows ­­",
  "It's a problem if you know, and chose to live on an Indian reservation. It ­­ it ­­ I mean, that exists. What's different in this case is the history is 130 years of people who believe and chose. And they are not living on an Indian reservation; they are living in the State of Nebraska. I call the State patrol. The Tribal police are not patrolling up and down my street. That's the difference. It's the justifiable expectations of the people who live there.",
  "Glad I didn't answer what I thought of that argument. Your Honor, what ­­ it is still ­­ invites the litigation over what is the extent of the power. Who's got the power to govern? What is the extent of their power? Uncertainty, when you have expectations, you live in an area where the State governs you, and then to say we can go back and litigate all these issues is ­­ is just not what the public expects. The people in Pender, this is a big deal. They care about this. They have expectations. It's a big deal whether a Tribe ­­ Tribal Council has authority over us. We don't get to vote for them. Their Constitution doesn't even allow us to appear at their public meetings. The concept that somehow or other we can't find the right­of­way because it's not on Google is frankly silly. It's very easy to go back, do surveys, find exactly where the right­of­way is.",
  "Thank you, Your Honor."
